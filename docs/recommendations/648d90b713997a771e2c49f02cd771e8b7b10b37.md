        <tr id="Medical time series are sequential data collected over time that measures health-related signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and intensive care unit (ICU) readings. Analyzing medical time series and identifying the latent patterns and trends that lead to uncovering highly valuable insights for enhancing diagnosis, treatment, risk assessment, and disease progression. However, data mining in medical time series is heavily limited by the sample annotation which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and expert-depending. To mitigate this challenge, the emerging self-supervised contrastive learning, which has shown great success since 2020, is a promising solution. Contrastive learning aims to learn representative embeddings by contrasting positive and negative samples without the requirement for explicit labels. Here, we conducted a systematic review of how contrastive learning alleviates the label scarcity in medical time series based on PRISMA standards. We searched the studies in five scientific databases (IEEE, ACM, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed) and retrieved 1908 papers based on the inclusion criteria. After applying excluding criteria, and screening at title, abstract, and full text levels, we carefully reviewed 43 papers in this area. Specifically, this paper outlines the pipeline of contrastive learning, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and testing. We provide a comprehensive summary of the various augmentations applied to medical time series data, the architectures of pre-training encoders, the types of fine-tuning classifiers and clusters, and the popular contrastive loss functions. Moreover, we present an overview of the different data types used in medical time series, highlight the medical applications of interest, and provide a comprehensive table of 51 public datasets that have been utilized in this field. In addition, this paper will provide a discussion on the promising future scopes such as providing guidance for effective augmentation design, developing a unified framework for analyzing hierarchical time series, and investigating methods for processing multimodal data. Despite being in its early stages, self-supervised contrastive learning has shown great potential in overcoming the need for expert-created annotations in the research of medical time series.">

        <tr id="Time series is a typical data type in numerous domains; however, labeling large amounts of time series data can be costly and time-consuming. Learning effective representation from unlabeled time series data is a challenging task. Contrastive learning stands out as a promising method to acquire representations of unlabeled time series data. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised time-series representation learning framework via Time-Frequency Fusion Contrasting (TF-FC) to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. Specifically, TF-FC combines time-domain augmentation with frequency-domain augmentation to generate the diverse samples. For time-domain augmentation, the raw time series data pass through the time-domain augmentation bank (such as jitter, scaling, permutation, and masking) and get time-domain augmentation data. For frequency-domain augmentation, first, the raw time series undergoes conversion into frequency domain data following Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. Then, the frequency data passes through the frequency-domain augmentation bank (such as low pass filter, remove frequency, add frequency, and phase shift) and gets frequency-domain augmentation data. The fusion method of time-domain augmentation data and frequency-domain augmentation data is kernel PCA, which is useful for extracting nonlinear features in high-dimensional spaces. By capturing both the time and frequency domains of the time series, the proposed approach is able to extract more informative features from the data, enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish between different time series. To verify the effectiveness of the TF-FC method, we conducted experiments on four time series domain datasets (i.e., SleepEEG, HAR, Gesture, and Epilepsy). Experimental results show that TF-FC significantly improves in recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.">

        <tr id="Limited availability of labeled physiological data often prohibits the use of powerful supervised deep learning models in the biomedical machine intelligence domain. We approach this problem and propose a novel encoding framework that relies on self-supervised learning with momentum contrast to learn representations from multivariate time-series of various physiological domains without needing labels. Our model uses a transformer architecture that can be easily adapted to classification problems by optimizing a linear output classification layer. We experimentally evaluate our framework using two publicly available physiological datasets from different domains, i.e., human activity recognition from embedded inertial sensory and emotion recognition from electroencephalography. We show that our self-supervised learning approach can indeed learn discriminative features which can be exploited in downstream classification tasks. Our work enables the development of domain-agnostic intelligent systems that can effectively analyze multivariate time-series data from physiological domains.">

However, for time series with less intuitive or semantic meaning, sampling bias may be inevitably encountered in unsupervised approaches. Although supervised contrastive learning has shown superior performance by leveraging label information, it may also suffer from class collapse. In this study, we consider a realistic scenario in industry with limited annotation information available. A supervised contrastive framework is developed for high-frequency time series representation and classification, wherein a novel variant of supervised contrastive loss is proposed to include multiple augmentations while induce spread within each class. Experiments on four mainstream public datasets as well as a series of sensitivity and ablation analyses demonstrate that the learned representations are effective and robust compared with the direct supervised learning and self-supervised learning, notably under the minimal few-shot situation.">

        <tr id="Contrastive representation learning is crucial in medical time series analysis as it alleviates dependency on labor-intensive, domain-specific, and scarce expert annotations. However, existing contrastive learning methods primarily focus on one single data level, which fails to fully exploit the intricate nature of medical time series. To address this issue, we present COMET, an innovative hierarchical framework that leverages data consistencies at all inherent levels in medical time series. Our meticulously designed model systematically captures data consistency from four potential levels: observation, sample, trial, and patient levels. By developing contrastive loss at multiple levels, we can learn effective representations that preserve comprehensive data consistency, maximizing information utilization in a self-supervised manner. We conduct experiments in the challenging patient-independent setting. We compare COMET against six baselines using three diverse datasets, which include ECG signals for myocardial infarction and EEG signals for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The results demonstrate that COMET consistently outperforms all baselines, particularly in setup with 10% and 1% labeled data fractions across all datasets. These results underscore the significant impact of our framework in advancing contrastive representation learning techniques for medical time series.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) provides a strategy for improving machine learning performance in data-rich (target) domains where ground truth labels are inaccessible but can be found in related (source) domains. In cases where meta-domain information such as label distributions is available, weak supervision can further boost performance. We propose a novel framework, CALDA, to tackle these two problems. CALDA synergistically combines the principles of contrastive learning and adversarial learning to robustly support multi-source UDA (MS-UDA) for time series data. Similar to prior methods, CALDA utilizes adversarial learning to align source and target feature representations. Unlike prior approaches, CALDA additionally leverages cross-source label information across domains. CALDA pulls examples with the same label close to each other, while pushing apart examples with different labels, reshaping the space through contrastive learning. Unlike prior contrastive adaptation methods, CALDA requires neither data augmentation nor pseudo labeling, which may be more challenging for time series. We empirically validate our proposed approach. Based on results from human activity recognition, electromyography, and synthetic datasets, we find utilizing cross-source information improves performance over prior time series and contrastive methods. Weak supervision further improves performance, even in the presence of noise, allowing CALDA to offer generalizable strategies for MS-UDA.">

        <tr id="To improve the accuracy of clinical multivariate time series (MTS) classification (such as EEG and ECG) by a novel self-supervised paradigm that directly captures the dynamics between the different time series learned together to optimize the classification task. Labels in clinical datasets are very often insufficient. One way to address this challenge is leveraging self-supervision. This paradigm attempts to identify a supervisory signal inherent within a dataset to serve as a surrogate label. We present a novel form of self-supervision: dynamics of clinical MTS. Unlike other self-supervision methods, such as masking, that are intuitive but still heuristic, we suggest to learn a representation justified by Koopman theory. The latter was shown useful for representing clinical time series and can be used as a form of surrogate task to improve the clinical MTS classification. In the ECG task, we show that our proposed framework achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline over numerous common diagnoses. For EEG abnormality classification, our proposed framework also achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than the SOTA baseline. All results are statistically significant. Our technique yields reliable clinical diagnosis in an empirical study employing signals from thousands of patients in multiple clinical tasks employing two types of clinical-grade sensors (ECG and EEG) as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning. Leveraging time-series-dynamics self-supervision can help mitigate the lack of labels in clinical datasets used for training machine learning algorithms and significantly improve their performance. Specifically, the ECG system presented in this work is being trialed in hospitals, used by top cardiologists for patient diagnosis and treatment. We believe that the deployment of such cutting-edge technology will significantly improve the accuracy and speed of cardiac assessments.">

        <tr id="Monitoring and recognizing patterns in continuous sensing data is crucial for many practical applications. These real-world time-series data are often nonstationary, characterized by varying statistical and spectral properties over time. This poses a significant challenge in developing learning models that can effectively generalize across different distributions. In this work, based on our observation that nonstationary statistics are intrinsically linked to the phase information, we propose a time-series learning framework, PhASER. It consists of three novel elements: 1) phase augmentation that diversifies non-stationarity while preserving discriminatory semantics, 2) separate feature encoding by viewing time-varying magnitude and phase as independent modalities, and 3) feature broadcasting by incorporating phase with a novel residual connection for inherent regularization to enhance distribution invariant learning. Upon extensive evaluation on 5 datasets from human activity recognition, sleep-stage classification, and gesture recognition against 10 state-of-the-art baseline methods, we demonstrate that PhASER consistently outperforms the best baselines by an average of 5% and up to 13% in some cases. Moreover, PhASER's principles can be applied broadly to boost the generalization ability of existing time series classification models.">

In particular, contrastive methods are most effective where data augmentation can be easily constructed e.g. in computer vision. However, they are less successful in domains without established data transformations such as time series data. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework that combines contrastive learning with neural processes. It relies on recent advances in neural processes to perform time series forecasting. This allows to generate augmented versions of data by employing a set of various sampling functions and, hence, avoid manually designed augmentations. We extend conventional neural processes and propose a new contrastive loss to learn times series representations in a self-supervised setup. Therefore, unlike previous self-supervised methods, our augmentation pipeline is task-agnostic, enabling our method to perform well across various applications. In particular, a ResNet with a linear classifier trained using our approach is able to outperform state-of-the-art techniques across industrial, medical and audio datasets improving accuracy over 10% in ECG periodic data. We further demonstrate that our self-supervised representations are more efficient in the latent space, improving multiple clustering indexes and that fine-tuning our method on 10% of labels achieves results competitive to fully-supervised learning.">

        <tr id="Learning representations from unlabeled time series data is a challenging problem. Most existing self-supervised and unsupervised approaches in the time-series domain fall short in capturing low-and high-frequency features at the same time. As a result, the generalization ability of the learned representations remains limited. Furthermore, some of these methods employ large-scale models like transformers or rely on computationally expensive techniques such as contrastive learning. To tackle these problems, we propose a noncontrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) approach that efficiently captures low-and high-frequency features in a cost-effective manner. The proposed framework comprises a Siamese configuration of a deep neural network with two weight-sharing branches which are followed by low-and high-frequency feature extraction modules. The two branches of the proposed network allow bootstrapping of the latent representation by taking two different augmented views of raw time series data as input. The augmented views are created by applying random transformations sampled from a single set of augmentations. The low-and high-frequency feature extraction modules of the proposed network contain a combination of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and temporal convolutional network (TCN) heads, respectively, which capture the temporal dependencies from the raw input data at various scales due to the varying receptive fields. To demonstrate the robustness of our model, we performed extensive experiments and ablation studies on five real-world time-series datasets.
