        <tr id="Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.">

        <tr id="In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different time points. Here, we introduce RAINDROP, a graph neural network that embeds irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. RAINDROP represents every sample as a separate sensor graph and models time-varying dependencies between sensors with a novel message passing operator. It estimates the latent sensor graph structure and leverages the structure together with nearby observations to predict misaligned readouts. This model can be interpreted as a graph neural network that sends messages over graphs that are optimized for capturing time-varying dependencies among sensors. We use RAINDROP to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. RAINDROP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.4% (absolute F1-score points), including techniques that deal with irregular sampling using fixed discretization and set functions. RAINDROP shows superiority in diverse setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have shown to be effective in time series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global) inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate predictions.">

        <tr id="Outstanding achievements of graph neural networks for spatiotemporal time series analysis show that relational constraints introduce an effective inductive bias into neural forecasting architectures. Often, however, the relational information characterizing the underlying data-generating process is unavailable and the practitioner is left with the problem of inferring from data which relational graph to use in the subsequent processing stages. We propose novel, principled - yet practical - probabilistic score-based methods that learn the relational dependencies as distributions over graphs while maximizing end-to-end the performance at task. The proposed graph learning framework is based on consolidated variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo score-based gradient estimation, is theoretically grounded, and, as we show, effective in practice. In this paper, we focus on the time series forecasting problem and show that, by tailoring the gradient estimators to the graph learning problem, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance while controlling the sparsity of the learned graph and the computational scalability. We empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that the proposed solution can be used as a stand-alone graph identification procedure as well as a graph learning component of an end-to-end forecasting architecture.">

        <tr id="Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic) graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed, recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions.">

        <tr id="By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.">

        <tr id="Attention mechanisms have been widely used to capture long-range dependencies among nodes in Graph Transformers. Bottlenecked by the quadratic computational cost, attention mechanisms fail to scale in large graphs. Recent improvements in computational efficiency are mainly achieved by attention sparsification with random or heuristic-based graph subsampling, which falls short in data-dependent context reasoning. State space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained prominence for their effectiveness and efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, adapting SSMs to non-sequential graph data presents a notable challenge. In this work, we introduce Graph-Mamba, the first attempt to enhance long-range context modeling in graph networks by integrating a Mamba block with the input-dependent node selection mechanism. Specifically, we formulate graph-centric node prioritization and permutation strategies to enhance context-aware reasoning, leading to a substantial improvement in predictive performance. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-range graph prediction tasks, with a fraction of the computational cost in both FLOPs and GPU memory consumption. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/Graph-Mamba.">

        <tr id="Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.">

        <tr id="Large pre-trained models excel in zero/few-shot learning for language and vision tasks but face challenges in multivariate time series (TS) forecasting due to diverse data characteristics. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1. Model weights for more sophisticated variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, and TTM-A) will be shared soon.

        <tr id="Pre-training on time series poses a unique challenge due to the potential mismatch between pre-training and target domains, such as shifts in temporal dynamics, fast-evolving trends, and long-range and short-cyclic effects, which can lead to poor downstream performance. While domain adaptation methods can mitigate these shifts, most methods need examples directly from the target domain, making them suboptimal for pre-training. To address this challenge, methods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and be capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training. Relative to other modalities, in time series, we expect that time-based and frequency-based representations of the same example are located close together in the time-frequency space. To this end, we posit that time-frequency consistency (TF-C) -- embedding a time-based neighborhood of an example close to its frequency-based neighborhood -- is desirable for pre-training. Motivated by TF-C, we define a decomposable pre-training model, where the self-supervised signal is provided by the distance between time and frequency components, each individually trained by contrastive estimation. We evaluate the new method on eight datasets, including electrodiagnostic testing, human activity recognition, mechanical fault detection, and physical status monitoring. Experiments against eight state-of-the-art methods show that TF-C outperforms baselines by 15.4% (F1 score) on average in one-to-one settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model on EMG data) and by 8.4% (precision) in challenging one-to-many settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model for either hand-gesture recognition or mechanical fault prediction), reflecting the breadth of scenarios that arise in real-world applications.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that Raincoat can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.">

The proposed AZ-test can be intended as a spatio-temporal extension of traditional tests designed for system identiﬁcation to graph signals. The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes over time, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as it is the case in many application scenarios like sensor and transportation networks. The asymptotic distribution of the designed test can be derived under the null hypothesis without assuming identically distributed data. We show the effectiveness of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and illustrate how it can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graph stream.">

Within this framework, relational inductive biases, e.g., associated with functional dependencies existing among signals, are not explicitly exploited leaving unattended great opportunities for effective modeling approaches. The manuscript aims, for the first time, at filling this gap by matching state-space modeling and spatio-temporal data where the relational information, say the functional graph capturing latent dependencies, is learned directly from data and is allowed to change over time. Within a probabilistic formulation that accounts for the uncertainty in the data-generating process, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn the state-space model end-to-end on a downstream task. The proposed methodological framework generalizes several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates to be effective in extracting meaningful relational information while achieving optimal forecasting performance in controlled environments.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a pivotal role in many real-world applications. Recently, the utilization of Large Language Models (LLM) in TSF has demonstrated exceptional predictive performance, surpassing most task-specific forecasting models. The success of LLM-based forecasting methods underscores the importance of causal dependence modeling and pre-trained knowledge transfer. However, challenges persist in directly applying LLM to TSF, i.e., the unacceptable parameter scales for resource-intensive model optimization, and the significant gap of feature space between structural numerical time series and natural language. To this end, we propose LeRet, a Language-empowered Retentive network for TSF. Technically, inspired by the causal extraction in LLM, we propose a causal dependence learner, enhanced by a patch-level pre-training task, to capture sequential causal evolution. To minimize the gap between numeric and language, we initialize a language description protocol for time series and design a TS-related language knowledge extractor to learn from language description, avoiding training with large-scale parameters. Finally, we dedicatedly achieve a Language-TS Modality Integrator for the fusion of two types data, and enable language-empowered sequence forecasting. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our LeRet, especially reveal superiority on few-shot, and zero-shot forecasting tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/hqh0728/LeRet.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting (TSF) is crucial in fields like economic forecasting, weather prediction, traffic flow analysis, and public health surveillance. Real-world time series data often include noise, outliers, and missing values, making accurate forecasting challenging. Traditional methods model point-to-point relationships, which limits their ability to capture complex temporal patterns and increases their susceptibility to noise.To address these issues, we introduce the WindowMixer model, built on an all-MLP framework. WindowMixer leverages the continuous nature of time series by examining temporal variations from a window-based perspective. It decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components, handling them individually. For trends, a fully connected (FC) layer makes predictions. For seasonal components, time windows are projected to produce window tokens, processed by Intra-Window-Mixer and Inter-Window-Mixer modules. The Intra-Window-Mixer models relationships within each window, while the Inter-Window-Mixer models relationships between windows. This approach captures intricate patterns and long-range dependencies in the data.Experiments show WindowMixer consistently outperforms existing methods in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.">

Analyzing time series data is of great significance in real-world scenarios and has been widely studied over centuries. Recent years have witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in the time series community, with techniques shifting from traditional statistical methods to advanced deep learning models. In this paper, we delve into the design of deep time series models across various analysis tasks and review the existing literature from two perspectives: basic modules and model architectures. Further, we develop and release Time Series Library (TSLib) as a fair benchmark of deep time series models for diverse analysis tasks, which implements 24 mainstream models, covers 30 datasets from different domains, and supports five prevalent analysis tasks. Based on TSLib, we thoroughly evaluate 12 advanced deep time series models on different tasks. Empirical results indicate that models with specific structures are well-suited for distinct analytical tasks, which offers insights for research and adoption of deep time series models.

        <tr id="Long time series forecasting aims to utilize historical information to forecast future states over extended horizons. Traditional RNN-based series forecasting methods struggle to effectively address long-term dependencies and gradient issues in long time series problems. Recently, SegRNN has emerged as a leading RNN-based model tailored for long-term series forecasting, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a streamlined architecture through innovative segmentation and parallel decoding techniques. Nevertheless, SegRNN has several limitations: its fixed segmentation disrupts data continuity and fails to effectively leverage information across different segments, the segmentation strategy employed by SegRNN does not fundamentally address the issue of information loss within the recurrent structure. To address these issues, we propose the ISMRNN method with three key enhancements: we introduce an implicit segmentation structure to decompose the time series and map it to segmented hidden states, resulting in denser information exchange during the segmentation phase. Additionally, we incorporate residual structures in the encoding layer to mitigate information loss within the recurrent structure. To extract information more effectively, we further integrate the Mamba architecture to enhance time series information extraction. Experiments on several real-world long time series forecasting datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art models.">

        <tr id="Multi-variate time series forecasting is an important problem with a wide range of applications. Recent works model the relations between time-series as graphs and have shown that propagating information over the relation graph can improve time series forecasting. However, in many cases, relational information is not available or is noisy and reliable. Moreover, most works ignore the underlying uncertainty of time-series both for structure learning and deriving the forecasts resulting in the structure not capturing the uncertainty resulting in forecast distributions with poor uncertainty estimates. We tackle this challenge and introduce STOIC, that leverages stochastic correlations between time-series to learn underlying structure between time-series and to provide well-calibrated and accurate forecasts. Over a wide-range of benchmark datasets STOIC provides around 16% more accurate and 14% better-calibrated forecasts. STOIC also shows better adaptation to noise in data during inference and captures important and useful relational information in various benchmarks.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based models have emerged as powerful tools for multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, existing Transformer models often fall short of capturing both intricate dependencies across variate and temporal dimensions in MTS data. Some recent models are proposed to separately capture variate and temporal dependencies through either two sequential or parallel attention mechanisms. However, these methods cannot directly and explicitly learn the intricate inter-series and intra-series dependencies. In this work, we first demonstrate that these dependencies are very important as they usually exist in real-world data. To directly model these dependencies, we propose a transformer-based model UniTST containing a unified attention mechanism on the flattened patch tokens. Additionally, we add a dispatcher module which reduces the complexity and makes the model feasible for a potentially large number of variates. Although our proposed model employs a simple architecture, it offers compelling performance as shown in our extensive experiments on several datasets for time series forecasting.">

However, progress in the graph domain remains limited due to fundamental challenges such as feature heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity. Recently, increasing efforts have been made to enhance node feature quality with Large Language Models (LLMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), demonstrating superiority to traditional bag-of-words or word2vec techniques. These high-quality node features reduce the previously critical role of graph structure, resulting in a modest performance gap between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and structure-agnostic Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Motivated by this, we introduce a feature-centric pretraining perspective by treating graph structure as a prior and leveraging the rich, unified feature space to learn refined interaction patterns that generalizes across graphs. Our framework, Graph Sequence Pretraining with Transformer (GSPT), samples node contexts through random walks and employs masked feature reconstruction to capture pairwise proximity in the LLM-unified feature space using a standard Transformer. By utilizing unified text representations rather than varying structures, our framework achieves significantly better transferability among graphs within the same domain. GSPT can be easily adapted to both node classification and link prediction, demonstrating promising empirical success on various datasets.">

        <tr id="In multivariate time-series forecasting (MTSF), extracting the temporal correlations of the input sequences is crucial. While popular Transformer-based predictive models can perform well, their quadratic computational complexity results in inefficiency and high overhead. The recently emerged Mamba, a selective state space model, has shown promising results in many fields due to its strong temporal feature extraction capabilities and linear computational complexity. However, due to the unilateral nature of Mamba, channel-independent predictive models based on Mamba cannot attend to the relationships among all variables in the manner of Transformer-based models. To address this issue, we combine fast-attention with Mamba to introduce a novel framework named FMamba for MTSF. Technically, we first extract the temporal features of the input variables through an embedding layer, then compute the dependencies among input variables via the fast-attention module. Subsequently, we use Mamba to selectively deal with the input features and further extract the temporal dependencies of the variables through the multi-layer perceptron block (MLP-block). Finally, FMamba obtains the predictive results through the projector, a linear layer. Experimental results on eight public datasets demonstrate that FMamba can achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational overhead.">

        <tr id="In recent years, significant progress has been made in multivariate time series forecasting using Linear-based, Transformer-based, and Convolution-based models. However, these approaches face notable limitations: linear forecasters struggle with representation capacities, attention mechanisms suffer from quadratic complexity, and convolutional models have a restricted receptive field. These constraints impede their effectiveness in modeling complex time series, particularly those with numerous variables. Additionally, many models adopt the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy, treating multivariate time series as uncorrelated univariate series while ignoring their correlations. For models considering inter-channel relationships, whether through the self-attention mechanism, linear combination, or convolution, they all incur high computational costs and focus solely on weighted summation relationships, neglecting potential proportional relationships between channels. In this work, we address these issues by leveraging the newly introduced state space model and propose \textbf{C-Mamba}, a novel approach that captures cross-channel dependencies while maintaining linear complexity without losing the global receptive field. Our model consists of two key components: (i) channel mixup, where two channels are mixed to enhance the training sets; (ii) channel attention enhanced patch-wise Mamba encoder that leverages the ability of the state space models to capture cross-time dependencies and models correlations between channels by mining their weight relationships. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven real-world time series datasets.

        <tr id="Traffic prediction is a challenging spatio-temporal forecasting problem that involves highly complex spatio-temporal correlations. This paper proposes a Multi-level Multi-view Augmented Spatio-temporal Transformer (LVSTformer) for traffic prediction. The model aims to capture spatial dependencies from three different levels: local geographic, global semantic, and pivotal nodes, along with long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Specifically, we design three spatial augmented views to delve into the spatial information from the perspectives of local, global, and pivotal nodes. By combining three spatial augmented views with three parallel spatial self-attention mechanisms, the model can comprehensively captures spatial dependencies at different levels. We design a gated temporal self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal context broadcasting module is introduced between two spatio-temporal layers to ensure a well-distributed allocation of attention scores, alleviating overfitting and information loss, and enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the model. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on six well-known traffic benchmarks, the experimental results demonstrate that LVSTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competing baselines, with the maximum improvement reaching up to 4.32%.">

In addition to advancing the state of the art on generalized time series benchmarks in domains such as electricity and weather, this model is the first general-purpose time series forecasting foundation model to be specifically tuned for observability metrics. Toto was trained on a dataset of one trillion time series data points, the largest among all currently published time series foundation models. Alongside publicly available time series datasets, 75% of the data used to train Toto consists of fully anonymous numerical metric data points from the Datadog platform. In our experiments, Toto outperforms existing time series foundation models on observability data. It does this while also excelling at general-purpose forecasting tasks, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple open benchmark datasets.">

Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configurations. In this work, we comprehensively analyze these design choices and aim to identify the best practices for training LTSM. Moreover, we propose \emph{time series prompt}, a novel statistical prompting strategy tailored to time series data. Furthermore, based on the observations in our analysis, we introduce \texttt{LTSM-bundle}, which bundles the best design choices we have identified.

        <tr id="It is challenging to scale time series forecasting models such that they forecast accurately for multiple distinct domains and datasets, all with potentially different underlying collection procedures (e.g., sample resolution), patterns (e.g., periodicity), and prediction requirements (e.g., reconstruction vs. forecasting). We call this general task universal forecasting. Existing methods usually assume that input data is regularly sampled, and they forecast to pre-determined horizons, resulting in failure to generalise outside of the scope of their training. We propose the DAM - a neural model that takes randomly sampled histories and outputs an adjustable basis composition as a continuous function of time for forecasting to non-fixed horizons. It involves three key components: (1) a flexible approach for using randomly sampled histories from a long-tail distribution, that enables an efficient global perspective of the underlying temporal dynamics while retaining focus on the recent history; (2) a transformer backbone that is trained on these actively sampled histories to produce, as representational output, (3) the basis coefficients of a continuous function of time. We show that a single univariate DAM, trained on 25 time series datasets, either outperformed or closely matched existing SoTA models at multivariate long-term forecasting across 18 datasets, including 8 held-out for zero-shot transfer, even though these models were trained to specialise for each dataset-horizon combination. This single DAM excels at zero-shot transfer and very-long-term forecasting, performs well at imputation, is interpretable via basis function composition and attention, can be tuned for different inference-cost requirements, is robust to missing and irregularly sampled data {by design}.">

        <tr id="In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, existing state-of-the-art deep learning approaches tend to focus on autoregressive formulations and overlook the information within exogenous indicators. To address this limitation, we present DeformTime, a neural network architecture that attempts to capture correlated temporal patterns from the input space, and hence, improve forecasting accuracy. It deploys two core operations performed by deformable attention blocks (DABs): learning dependencies across variables from different time steps (variable DAB), and preserving temporal dependencies in data from previous time steps (temporal DAB). Input data transformation is explicitly designed to enhance learning from the deformed series of information while passing through a DAB. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 MTS data sets, using previously established benchmarks as well as challenging infectious disease modelling tasks with more exogenous variables. The results demonstrate that DeformTime improves accuracy against previous competitive methods across the vast majority of MTS forecasting tasks, reducing the mean absolute error by 10% on average. Notably, performance gains remain consistent across longer forecasting horizons.">

        <tr id="Machine learning on graphs has recently found extensive applications across domains. However, the commonly used Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) suffer from limited expressive power and struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Graph transformers offer a strong alternative due to their global attention mechanism, but they come with great computational overheads, especially for large graphs. In recent years, State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a compelling approach to replace full attention in transformers to model sequential data. It blends the strengths of RNNs and CNNs, offering a) efficient computation, b) the ability to capture long-range dependencies, and c) good generalization across sequences of various lengths. However, extending SSMs to graph-structured data presents unique challenges due to the lack of canonical node ordering in graphs. In this work, we propose Graph State Space Convolution (GSSC) as a principled extension of SSMs to graph-structured data. By leveraging global permutation-equivariant set aggregation and factorizable graph kernels that rely on relative node distances as the convolution kernels, GSSC preserves all three advantages of SSMs. We demonstrate the provably stronger expressiveness of GSSC than MPNNs in counting graph substructures and show its effectiveness across 10 real-world, widely used benchmark datasets, where GSSC achieves best results on 7 out of 10 datasets with all significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art baselines and second-best results on the other 3 datasets. Our findings highlight the potential of GSSC as a powerful and scalable model for graph machine learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/GSSC.">

In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.">

        <tr id="Discrete-Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs), which are prevalent in real-world implementations and notable for their ease of data acquisition, have garnered considerable attention from both academic researchers and industry practitioners. The representation learning of DTDGs has been extensively applied to model the dynamics of temporally changing entities and their evolving connections. Currently, DTDG representation learning predominantly relies on GNN+RNN architectures, which manifest the inherent limitations of both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). GNNs suffer from the over-smoothing issue as the models architecture goes deeper, while RNNs struggle to capture long-term dependencies effectively. GNN+RNN architectures also grapple with scaling to large graph sizes and long sequences. Additionally, these methods often compute node representations separately and focus solely on individual node characteristics, thereby overlooking the behavior intersections between the two nodes whose link is being predicted, such as instances where the two nodes appear together in the same context or share common neighbors. This paper introduces a novel representation learning method DTFormer for DTDGs, pivoting from the traditional GNN+RNN framework to a Transformer-based architecture. Our approach exploits the attention mechanism to concurrently process topological information within the graph at each timestamp and temporal dynamics of graphs along the timestamps, circumventing the aforementioned fundamental weakness of both GNNs and RNNs. Moreover, we enhance the model's expressive capability by incorporating the intersection relationships among nodes and integrating a multi-patching module. Extensive experiments conducted on six public dynamic graph benchmark datasets confirm our model's efficacy, achieving the SOTA performance.">

        <tr id="Exploiting self-supervised learning (SSL) to extract the universal representations of time series could not only capture the natural properties of time series but also offer huge help to the downstream tasks. Nevertheless, existing time series representation learning (TSRL) methods face challenges in attaining universality. Indeed, existing methods relying solely on one SSL strategy (either contrastive learning (CL) or generative) often fall short in capturing rich semantic information for various downstream tasks. Moreover, time series exhibit diverse distributions and inherent characteristics, particularly with the common occurrence of missing values, posing a notable challenge for existing backbones in effectively handling such diverse time series data. To bridge these gaps, we propose CTRL, a framework for universal TSRL. For the first time, we employ Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) as the backbone for TSRL, which captures the continuous processes and exhibits robustness to missing data. Additionally, a dual-task SSL strategy, integrating both reconstruction and contrasting tasks, is proposed to enrich the semantic information of the learned representations. Furthermore, novel hard negative construction and false negative elimination mechanisms are proposed to improve sampling efficiency and reduce sampling bias in CL. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CTRL in forecasting, classification, and imputation tasks, particularly its outstanding robustness to missing data.">

        <tr id="Transformer has gained widespread adoption in modeling time series due to the exceptional ability of its self-attention mechanism in capturing long-range dependencies. However, when processing time series data with numerous variates, the vanilla self-attention mechanism tends to distribute attention weights evenly and smoothly, causing row-homogenization in attention maps and further hampering time series forecasting. To tackle this issue, we propose an advanced Transformer architecture entitled SDformer, which designs two novel modules, Spectral-Filter-Transform (SFT) and Dynamic-Directional-Attention (DDA), and integrates them into the encoder of Transformer to achieve more intensive attention allocation. Specifically, the SFT module utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform to select the most prominent frequencies, along with a Hamming Window to smooth and denoise the filtered series data; The DDA module applies a specialized kernel function to the query and key vectors projected from the denoised data, concentrating this innovative attention mechanism more effectively on the most informative variates to obtain a sharper attention distribution. These two modules jointly enable attention weights to be more salient among numerous variates, which in turn enhances the attention's ability to capture multivariate correlations, improving the performance in forecasting. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate its superior performance over other state-of-the-art models. Code is available at https://github.com/zhouziyu02/SDformer.">

Our method, Graph Foundation Model (GraphFM), leverages a Perceiver-based encoder that employs learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a common latent space. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize across different graphs and allows for scaling across diverse data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a model on 152 different graph datasets comprising over 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges, establishing the first set of scaling laws for multi-graph pretraining on datasets spanning many domains (e.g., molecules, citation and product graphs). Our results show that pretraining on a diverse array of real and synthetic graphs improves the model's adaptability and stability, while performing competitively with state-of-the-art specialist models. This work illustrates that multi-graph pretraining can significantly reduce the burden imposed by the current graph training paradigm, unlocking new capabilities for the field of graph neural networks by creating a single generalist model that performs competitively across a wide range of datasets and tasks.">

        <tr id="Graph pre-training has been concentrated on graph-level on small graphs (e.g., molecular graphs) or learning node representations on a fixed graph. Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Specifically, we design a flexible and scalable graph transformer as the backbone network. Meanwhile, based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other one for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our framework can perform pre-training on real-world web-scale graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and generalizes effectively to unseen new graphs with different downstream tasks. We further conduct experiments on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset, which consists of 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both industrial datasets and public datasets, while also enjoying scalability and efficiency.">

        <tr id="Current Transformer methods for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting (MTSF) are all based on the conventional attention mechanism. They involve sequence embedding and performing a linear projection of Q, K, and V, and then computing attention within this latent space. We have never delved into the attention mechanism to explore whether such a mapping space is optimal for MTSF. To investigate this issue, this study first proposes Frequency Spectrum attention (FSatten), a novel attention mechanism based on the frequency domain space. It employs the Fourier transform for embedding and introduces Multi-head Spectrum Scaling (MSS) to replace the conventional linear mapping of Q and K. FSatten can accurately capture the periodic dependencies between sequences and outperform the conventional attention without changing mainstream architectures. We further design a more general method dubbed Scaled Orthogonal attention (SOatten). We propose an orthogonal embedding and a Head-Coupling Convolution (HCC) based on the neighboring similarity bias to guide the model in learning comprehensive dependency patterns. Experiments show that FSatten and SOatten surpass the SOTA which uses conventional attention, making it a good alternative as a basic attention mechanism for MTSF.

        <tr id="Short fixed-length inputs are the main bottleneck of deep learning methods in long time-series forecasting tasks. Prolonging input length causes overfitting, rapidly deteriorating accuracy. Our research indicates that the overfitting is a combination reaction of the multi-scale pattern coupling in time series and the fixed focusing scale of current models. First, we find that the patterns exhibited by a time series across various scales are reflective of its multi-periodic nature, where each scale corresponds to specific period length. Second, We find that the token size predominantly dictates model behavior, as it determines the scale at which the model focuses and the context size it can accommodate. Our idea is to decouple the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series and to model each pattern with its corresponding period length as token size. We introduced a novel series-decomposition module(MPSD), and a Multi-Token Pattern Recognition neural network(MTPR), enabling the model to handle \textit{inputs up to $10\times$ longer}. Sufficient context enhances performance(\textit{38% maximum precision improvement}), and the decoupling approach offers \textit{Low complexity($0.22\times$ cost)} and \textit{high interpretability}.">

On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) with extensive pretrained knowledge and powerful semantic comprehension abilities have recently shown a remarkable ability to benefit applications using vision and text data. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs can be leveraged in a computationally efficient fashion to benefit rich graph-structured data, a modality relatively unexplored in LLM literature. Prior works in this area exploit LLMs to augment every node features in an ad-hoc fashion (not scalable for large graphs), use natural language to describe the complex structural information of graphs, or perform computationally expensive finetuning of LLMs in conjunction with GNNs. We propose E-LLaGNN (Efficient LLMs augmented GNNs), a framework with an on-demand LLM service that enriches message passing procedure of graph learning by enhancing a limited fraction of nodes from the graph. More specifically, E-LLaGNN relies on sampling high-quality neighborhoods using LLMs, followed by on-demand neighborhood feature enhancement using diverse prompts from our prompt catalog, and finally information aggregation using message passing from conventional GNN architectures. We explore several heuristics-based active node selection strategies to limit the computational and memory footprint of LLMs when handling millions of nodes. Through extensive experiments&ablation on popular graph benchmarks of varying scales (Cora, PubMed, ArXiv,&Products), we illustrate the effectiveness of our E-LLaGNN framework and reveal many interesting capabilities such as improved gradient flow in deep GNNs, LLM-free inference ability etc.">

        <tr id="The non-stationary nature of real-world Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data presents forecasting models with a formidable challenge of the time-variant distribution of time series, referred to as distribution shift. Existing studies on the distribution shift mostly adhere to adaptive normalization techniques for alleviating temporal mean and covariance shifts or time-variant modeling for capturing temporal shifts. Despite improving model generalization, these normalization-based methods often assume a time-invariant transition between outputs and inputs but disregard specific intra-/inter-series correlations, while time-variant models overlook the intrinsic causes of the distribution shift. This limits model expressiveness and interpretability of tackling the distribution shift for MTS forecasting. To mitigate such a dilemma, we present a unified Probabilistic Graphical Model to Jointly capturing intra-/inter-series correlations and modeling the time-variant transitional distribution, and instantiate a neural framework called JointPGM for non-stationary MTS forecasting. Specifically, JointPGM first employs multiple Fourier basis functions to learn dynamic time factors and designs two distinct learners: intra-series and inter-series learners. The intra-series learner effectively captures temporal dynamics by utilizing temporal gates, while the inter-series learner explicitly models spatial dynamics through multi-hop propagation, incorporating Gumbel-softmax sampling. These two types of series dynamics are subsequently fused into a latent variable, which is inversely employed to infer time factors, generate final prediction, and perform reconstruction. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of JointPGM through extensive experiments on six highly non-stationary MTS datasets, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance of MTS forecasting.">

In particular, time-dependent tabular data, where rows are chronologically related, is typically used for recording historical events, e.g., financial transactions, healthcare records, or stock history. Recently, hierarchical variants of the attention mechanism of transformer architectures have been used to model tabular time-series data. At first, rows (or columns) are encoded separately by computing attention between their fields. Subsequently, encoded rows (or columns) are attended to one another to model the entire tabular time-series. While efficient, this approach constrains the attention granularity and limits its ability to learn patterns at the field-level across separate rows, or columns. We take a first step to address this gap by proposing Fieldy, a fine-grained hierarchical model that contextualizes fields at both the row and column levels. We compare our proposal against state of the art models on regression and classification tasks using public tabular time-series datasets. Our results show that combining row-wise and column-wise attention improves performance without increasing model size. Code and data are available at https://github.com/raphaaal/fieldy.">

Traditional time-series analysis approaches have fallen short in capturing the intricate interplay between these factors. Recent advancements have witnessed the incorporation of graph neural networks and machine learning techniques to bridge this gap, enhancing predictive accuracy and providing novel insights into disease spread mechanisms. Notable endeavors include leveraging human mobility data, employing transfer learning, and integrating advanced models such as Transformers and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to improve forecasting performance across diverse geographies for both influenza and COVID-19. However, these models often face challenges related to data quality, model transferability, and potential overfitting, highlighting the necessity for more adaptable and robust approaches. This paper introduces the Graph Attention-based Spatial Temporal (GAST) model, which employs graph attention networks (GATs) to overcome these limitations by providing a nuanced understanding of epidemic dynamics through a sophisticated spatio-temporal analysis framework. Our contributions include the development and validation of the GAST model, demonstrating its superior forecasting capabilities for influenza and COVID-19 spread, with a particular focus on short-term, daily predictions. The model’s application to both influenza and COVID-19 datasets showcases its versatility and potential to inform public health interventions across a range of infectious diseases.">

Previously, forecasts in financial markets have been approached in two main ways: either as time-series problems over price sequence or sentiment analysis tasks. The sentiment analysis tasks aim to determine whether news events will have a positive or negative impact on stock prices, often categorizing them into discrete labels. Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to accurately model time series prediction, we propose a collaborative modeling framework that incorporates textual information about relevant events for predictions.

Predicting dynamic links between nodes in a temporal graph is of vital importance. Traditional methods usually leverage the temporal neighborhood of interaction history to generate node embeddings first and then aggregate the source and target node embeddings to predict the link. However, such methods focus on learning individual node representations, but overlook the pairwise representation learning nature of link prediction and fail to capture the important pairwise features of links such as common neighbors (CN). Motivated by the success of Neural Common Neighbor (NCN) for static graph link prediction, we propose TNCN, a temporal version of NCN for link prediction in temporal graphs. TNCN dynamically updates a temporal neighbor dictionary for each node, and utilizes multi-hop common neighbors between the source and target node to learn a more effective pairwise representation. We validate our model on five large-scale real-world datasets from the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB), and find that it achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three of them.

As a highly abstracted information entity, 1D time series couples various patterns such as trends, seasonality, and dramatic changes (instantaneous high dynamic), it is difficult to exploit these highly coupled properties merely by analysis tools on purely time domain. To this end, we present Spectrogram Analysis and Representation Network (SpecAR-Net).

Next, we evaluate the transferability of Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) for the temporal graph property prediction task by pre-training on a collection of up to sixty-four token transaction networks and then evaluating the downstream performance on twenty unseen token networks. We find that the neural scaling law observed in NLP and Computer Vision also applies in temporal graph learning, where pre-training on greater number of networks leads to improved downstream performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of the transferability of temporal graphs learning. On downstream token networks, the largest pre-trained model outperforms single model TGNNs on thirteen unseen test networks. Therefore, we believe that this is a promising first step towards building foundation models for temporal graphs.">

These forecasting models leverage Transformers to capture dependencies between multiple time steps in a time series, with embedding tokens composed of data from individual time steps. However, challenges arise when applying Transformers to predict long sequences with strong periodicity, leading to performance degradation and increased computational burden. Furthermore, embedding tokens formed one time step at a time may struggle to reveal meaningful information in long sequences, failing to capture correlations between different time steps. In this study, we propose Skip-Timeformer, a Transformer-based model that utilizes a skip-time interaction for long sequence time-series forecasting. Specifically, we decompose the time series into multiple subsequences based on different time intervals, embedding various time steps into variable tokens across multiple sequences. The skip-time interaction mechanism utilizes these variable tokens to capture dependencies in the skip-time dimension. Additionally, skip-time interaction is employed to learn dependencies between sequences missed by multiple skip time steps. The Skip-Timeformer model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets, further enhancing the long sequence forecasting capabilities of the Transformer variations and better adapting to arbitrary lookback windows.">

GPL employs task-independent graph structure losses to encourage GNNs to learn intrinsic graph characteristics while simultaneously solving downstream tasks, producing higher-quality node and graph representations. In extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets, after being trained by GPL, GNNs significantly outperform their original performance on node classification, graph classification, and edge prediction tasks (up to 10.28%, 16.5%, and 24.15%, respectively). By allowing GNNs to capture the inherent structural prompts of graphs in GPL, they can alleviate the issue of over-smooth and achieve new state-of-the-art performances, which introduces a novel and effective direction for GNN research with potential applications in various domains.">

        <tr id="Learning temporal dependencies among targets (TDT) benefits better time series forecasting, where targets refer to the predicted sequence. Although autoregressive methods model TDT recursively, they suffer from inefficient inference and error accumulation. We argue that integrating TDT learning into non-autoregressive methods is essential for pursuing effective and efficient time series forecasting. In this study, we introduce the differencing approach to represent TDT and propose a parameter-free and plug-and-play solution through an optimization objective, namely TDT Loss. It leverages the proportion of inconsistent signs between predicted and ground truth TDT as an adaptive weight, dynamically balancing target prediction and fine-grained TDT fitting. Importantly, TDT Loss incurs negligible additional cost, with only $\mathcal{O}(n)$ increased computation and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory requirements, while significantly enhancing the predictive performance of non-autoregressive models. To assess the effectiveness of TDT loss, we conduct extensive experiments on 7 widely used datasets. The experimental results of plugging TDT loss into 6 state-of-the-art methods show that out of the 168 experiments, 75.00\% and 94.05\% exhibit improvements in terms of MSE and MAE with the maximum 24.56\% and 16.31\%, respectively.">

        <tr id="Significant efforts have been directed toward integrating powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse modalities, particularly focusing on the fusion of vision, language, and audio data. However, the graph-structured data, inherently rich in structural and domain-specific knowledge, have not yet been gracefully adapted to LLMs. Existing methods either describe the graph with raw text, suffering the loss of graph structural information, or feed Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings directly into LLM at the cost of losing semantic representation. To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative, end-to-end modality-aligning framework, equipped with a pretrained Dual-Residual Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (Dr.E). This framework is specifically designed to facilitate token-level alignment with LLMs, enabling an effective translation of the intrinsic `language' of graphs into comprehensible natural language. Our experimental evaluations on standard GNN node classification tasks demonstrate competitive performance against other state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, our framework ensures interpretability, efficiency, and robustness, with its effectiveness further validated under both fine-tuning and few-shot settings. This study marks the first successful endeavor to achieve token-level alignment between GNNs and LLMs.">

However, current research of long-sequence workload forecasting faces a series of challenges, mainly due to the high randomness and instability characteristics of long workload sequences, making it difficult for traditional machine learning methods to provide accurate results. Therefore, we designed a novel approach for long sequence forecasting, thoroughly considering the latent characteristics of cloud workload sequences. Initially, we employ convolution kernels of varying sizes to perform multiscale sequence decomposition, better capturing contextual information and periodic features in long sequence. Furthermore, through fast Fourier transformation, we convert one-dimensional sequences into two-dimensional space, leveraging dilated convolutions to extract effective features within the intra-period and inter-period variations. Ultimately, we introduce an attention mechanism, effectively integrating the intra-period and inter-period variation features into the proposed model. Our method has undergone comprehensive evaluation on publicly available datasets from Google, Alibaba, and Microsoft. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of our model across various workload types, showcasing its excellent adaptability to dynamic and complex workload scenarios.">

        <tr id="Key elements of human events are extracted as quadruples that consist of subject, relation, object, and timestamp. This representation can be extended to a quintuple by adding a fifth element: a textual summary that briefly describes the event. These quadruples or quintuples, when organized within a specific domain, form a temporal knowledge graph (TKG). Current learning frameworks focus on a few TKG-related tasks, such as predicting an object given a subject and a relation or forecasting the occurrences of multiple types of events (i.e., relation) in the next time window. They typically rely on complex structural and sequential models like graph neural networks (GNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to update intermediate embeddings. However, these methods often neglect the contextual information inherent in each quintuple, which can be effectively captured through concise textual descriptions. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can streamline the design of TKG learning frameworks while maintaining competitive accuracy in prediction and forecasting tasks. We develop multiple prompt templates to frame the object prediction (OP) task as a standard question-answering (QA) task, suitable for instruction fine-tuning with an encoder-decoder generative LLM. For multi-event forecasting (MEF), we design simple yet effective prompt templates for each TKG quintuple. This novel approach removes the need for GNNs and RNNs, instead utilizing an encoder-only LLM to generate fixed intermediate embeddings, which are subsequently processed by a prediction head with a self-attention mechanism to forecast potential future relations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets using various evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.">

Despite the rapid development of GraphLLM methods in recent years, the progress and understanding of this field remain unclear due to the lack of a benchmark with consistent experimental protocols. To bridge this gap, we introduce GLBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GraphLLM methods in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios. GLBench provides a fair and thorough evaluation of different categories of GraphLLM methods, along with traditional baselines such as graph neural networks. Through extensive experiments on a collection of real-world datasets with consistent data processing and splitting strategies, we have uncovered several key findings. Firstly, GraphLLM methods outperform traditional baselines in supervised settings, with LLM-as-enhancers showing the most robust performance. However, using LLMs as predictors is less effective and often leads to uncontrollable output issues. We also notice that no clear scaling laws exist for current GraphLLM methods. In addition, both structures and semantics are crucial for effective zero-shot transfer, and our proposed simple baseline can even outperform several models tailored for zero-shot scenarios.

However, we note that current time series multimodal methods are biased, often assigning a primary role to one modality while the other assumes a secondary role. They overlook the mutual benefits and complementary of different modalities. For example, in seizure diagnosis, relying solely on textual clinical reports makes it difficult to pinpoint the area and type of the disease, while electroencephalograms (EEGs) alone cannot provide an accurate diagnosis without considering the symptoms. In this study, based on the complementary information mining of time series multimodal data, we propose DualTime, a Dual-adapter multimodal language model for Time series representation implementing temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. By injecting lightweight adaption tokens, the LM pipeline shared by dual adapters encourages embedding alignment and achieves efficient fine-tuning. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both supervised and unsupervised settings, highlighting the complementary benefits of different modalities. In addition, we conduct few-shot label transfer experiments, which further verifies the transferability and expressiveness of our proposed DualTime.">

While increasingly complex models achieve impressive prediction performance, there are concerns about the effectiveness of these models in handling large-scale road networks. Especially for researchers who don't have access to powerful GPU devices, the expensive memory burden limits the usefulness of these models. In this paper, we take the first step of learning on the large-scale spatio-temporal graph and propose a divide-and-conquer training strategy for Large Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning, namely LarSTL. The core idea behind this strategy is to divide the large graph into multiple subgraphs, which are treated as task streams to sequentially train the model to conquer each subgraph one by one. We introduce a novel perspective based on the continuous learning paradigm to achieve this goal. In order to overcome forgetting the knowledge learned from previous subgraphs, an experience-replay strategy consolidates the learned knowledge by replaying nodes sampled from previous subgraphs. Moreover, we configure specific feature adaptors for each subgraph to extract personalized features, and it is also beneficial to consolidate the learned knowledge from the perspective of parameters. We conduct experiments using multiple large-scale traffic network datasets on a V100 GPU with only 16GB memory, and the results demonstrate that our LarSTL can achieve competitive performance and high efficiency.">

As a kind of universal graph prompt learning method, Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) has achieved remarkable success in adapting pre-trained models for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By fixing the parameters of a pre-trained GNN model, the aim of GPF is to modify the input graph data by adding some (learnable) prompt vectors into graph node features to better align with the downstream tasks on the smaller dataset. However, existing GPFs generally suffer from two main limitations. First, GPFs generally focus on node prompt learning which ignore the prompting for graph edges. Second, existing GPFs generally conduct the prompt learning on all nodes equally which fails to capture the importances of different nodes and may perform sensitively w.r.t noisy nodes in aligning with the downstream tasks. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new unified Graph Selective Prompt Feature learning (GSPF) for GNN fine-tuning. The proposed GSPF integrates the prompt learning on both graph node and edge together, which thus provides a unified prompt model for the graph data. Moreover, it conducts prompt learning selectively on nodes and edges by concentrating on the important nodes and edges for prompting which thus make our model be more reliable and compact. Experimental results on many benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GSPF method.">

We extend the Retentive Network to address the task of traffic flow forecasting. At the spatial scale, we integrate a topological graph structure into Spatial Retentive Network(S-RetNet), utilizing an adaptive adjacency matrix to extract dynamic spatial features of the road network. We also employ Graph Convolutional Networks to extract static spatial features of the road network. These two components are then fused to capture dynamic and static spatial correlations. At the temporal scale, we propose the Temporal Retentive Network(T-RetNet), which has been demonstrated to excel in capturing long-term dependencies in traffic flow patterns compared to other time series models, including Recurrent Neural Networks based and transformer models. We achieve the spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting task by integrating S-RetNet and T-RetNet to form ST-RetNet.

        <tr id="Temporal graphs have gained increasing importance due to their ability to model dynamically evolving relationships. These graphs can be represented through either a stream of edge events or a sequence of graph snapshots. Until now, the development of machine learning methods for both types has occurred largely in isolation, resulting in limited experimental comparison and theoretical crosspollination between the two. In this paper, we introduce Unified Temporal Graph (UTG), a framework that unifies snapshot-based and event-based machine learning models under a single umbrella, enabling models developed for one representation to be applied effectively to datasets of the other. We also propose a novel UTG training procedure to boost the performance of snapshot-based models in the streaming setting. We comprehensively evaluate both snapshot and event-based models across both types of temporal graphs on the temporal link prediction task. Our main findings are threefold: first, when combined with UTG training, snapshotbased models can perform competitively with event-based models such as TGN and GraphMixer even on event datasets. Second, snapshot-based models are at least an order of magnitude faster than most event-based models during inference. Third, while event-based methods such as NAT and DyGFormer outperforms snapshotbased methods on both types of temporal graphs, this is because they leverage joint neighborhood structural features thus emphasizing the potential to incorporate these features into snapshot-based models as well. These findings highlight the importance of comparing model architectures independent of the data format and suggest the potential of combining the efficiency of snapshot-based models with the performance of event-based models in the future.">

To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that combines the Transformer's language understanding with the robustness of graph neural network (GNN)-based neural algorithmic reasoners (NARs). Such NARs proved effective as generic solvers for algorithmic tasks, when specified in graph form.

We formulate the demand prediction as a meta-learning problem and develop the Feature-based First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (F-FOMAML) algorithm that leverages proxy data from non-peak periods and GNN-generated relational metadata to learn feature-specific layer parameters, thereby adapting to demand forecasts for peak events. Theoretically, we show that by considering domain similarities through task-specific metadata, our model achieves improved generalization, where the excess risk decreases as the number of training tasks increases. Empirical evaluations on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Compared to existing state-of-the-art models, our method demonstrates a notable improvement in demand prediction accuracy, reducing the Mean Absolute Error by 26.24% on an internal vending machine dataset and by 1.04% on the publicly accessible JD.com dataset.">

        <tr id="While most time series are non-stationary, it is inevitable for models to face the distribution shift issue in time series forecasting. Existing solutions manipulate statistical measures (usually mean and std.) to adjust time series distribution. However, these operations can be theoretically seen as the transformation towards zero frequency component of the spectrum which cannot reveal full distribution information and would further lead to information utilization bottleneck in normalization, thus hindering forecasting performance. To address this problem, we propose to utilize the whole frequency spectrum to transform time series to make full use of data distribution from the frequency perspective. We present a deep frequency derivative learning framework, DERITS, for non-stationary time series forecasting. Specifically, DERITS is built upon a novel reversible transformation, namely Frequency Derivative Transformation (FDT) that makes signals derived in the frequency domain to acquire more stationary frequency representations. Then, we propose the Order-adaptive Fourier Convolution Network to conduct adaptive frequency filtering and learning. Furthermore, we organize DERITS as a parallel-stacked architecture for the multi-order derivation and fusion for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several datasets which show the consistent superiority in both time series forecasting and shift alleviation.">

        <tr id="Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due to the dynamic nature of time-series data, it is crucial to equip TSF models with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities, as historical training data and future test data can have different distributions. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the inherent OOD problem in TSF via invariant learning. We identify fundamental challenges of invariant learning for TSF. First, the target variables in TSF may not be sufficiently determined by the input due to unobserved core variables in TSF, breaking the conventional assumption of invariant learning. Second, time-series datasets lack adequate environment labels, while existing environmental inference methods are not suitable for TSF. To address these challenges, we propose FOIL, a model-agnostic framework that enables timeseries Forecasting for Out-of-distribution generalization via Invariant Learning. FOIL employs a novel surrogate loss to mitigate the impact of unobserved variables. Further, FOIL implements a joint optimization by alternately inferring environments effectively with a multi-head network while preserving the temporal adjacency structure, and learning invariant representations across inferred environments for OOD generalized TSF. We demonstrate that the proposed FOIL significantly improves the performance of various TSF models, achieving gains of up to 85%.">

However, existing methods for processing local information either rely on sampling or simple aggregation, which respectively result in the loss and squashing of critical neighbor information.Moreover, the limited number of nodes in each mini-batch restricts the model's capacity to capture the global characteristic of the graph. In this paper, we propose LGMformer, a novel MGT model that employs a two-stage augmented interaction strategy, transitioning from local to global perspectives, to address the aforementioned bottlenecks.The local interaction augmentation (LIA) presents a neighbor-target interaction Transformer (NTIformer) to acquire an insightful understanding of the co-interaction patterns between neighbors and the target node, resulting in a locally effective token list that serves as input for the MGT. In contrast, global interaction augmentation (GIA) adopts a cross-attention mechanism to incorporate entire graph prototypes into the target node epresentation, thereby compensating for the global graph information to ensure a more comprehensive perception. To this end, LGMformer achieves the enhancement of node representations under the MGT paradigm.Experimental results related to node classification on the ten benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has become an increasingly popular research area due to its critical applications in various real-world domains such as traffic management, weather prediction, and financial analysis. Despite significant advancements, existing models face notable challenges, including the necessity of manual hyperparameter tuning for different datasets, and difficulty in effectively distinguishing signal from redundant features in data characterized by strong seasonality. These issues hinder the generalization and practical application of time series forecasting models. To solve this issues, we propose an innovative time series forecasting model TimeSieve designed to address these challenges. Our approach employs wavelet transforms to preprocess time series data, effectively capturing multi-scale features without the need for additional parameters or manual hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we introduce the information bottleneck theory that filters out redundant features from both detail and approximation coefficients, retaining only the most predictive information. This combination reduces significantly improves the model's accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 70\% of the datasets, achieving higher predictive accuracy and better generalization across diverse datasets. Our results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the key challenges in time series forecasting, paving the way for more reliable and efficient predictive models in practical applications.

This work introduces a \textit{compositional representation learning} approach trained on statistically coherent components extracted from sequential data. Based on a multi-scale change space, an unsupervised approach is proposed to segment the sequential data into chunks with similar statistical properties.

        <tr id="Hierarchical time-series forecasting (HTSF) is an important problem for many real-world business applications where the goal is to simultaneously forecast multiple time-series that are related to each other via a hierarchical relation. Recent works, however, do not address two important challenges that are typically observed in many demand forecasting applications at large companies. First, many time-series at lower levels of the hierarchy have high sparsity i.e., they have a significant number of zeros. Most HTSF methods do not address this varying sparsity across the hierarchy. Further, they do not scale well to the large size of the real-world hierarchy typically unseen in benchmarks used in literature. We resolve both these challenges by proposing HAILS, a novel probabilistic hierarchical model that enables accurate and calibrated probabilistic forecasts across the hierarchy by adaptively modeling sparse and dense time-series with different distributional assumptions and reconciling them to adhere to hierarchical constraints. We show the scalability and effectiveness of our methods by evaluating them against real-world demand forecasting datasets. We deploy HAILS at a large chemical manufacturing company for a product demand forecasting application with over ten thousand products and observe a significant 8.5\% improvement in forecast accuracy and 23% better improvement for sparse time-series. The enhanced accuracy and scalability make HAILS a valuable tool for improved business planning and customer experience.">

        <tr id="Time series is a typical data type in numerous domains; however, labeling large amounts of time series data can be costly and time-consuming. Learning effective representation from unlabeled time series data is a challenging task. Contrastive learning stands out as a promising method to acquire representations of unlabeled time series data. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised time-series representation learning framework via Time-Frequency Fusion Contrasting (TF-FC) to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. Specifically, TF-FC combines time-domain augmentation with frequency-domain augmentation to generate the diverse samples. For time-domain augmentation, the raw time series data pass through the time-domain augmentation bank (such as jitter, scaling, permutation, and masking) and get time-domain augmentation data. For frequency-domain augmentation, first, the raw time series undergoes conversion into frequency domain data following Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. Then, the frequency data passes through the frequency-domain augmentation bank (such as low pass filter, remove frequency, add frequency, and phase shift) and gets frequency-domain augmentation data. The fusion method of time-domain augmentation data and frequency-domain augmentation data is kernel PCA, which is useful for extracting nonlinear features in high-dimensional spaces. By capturing both the time and frequency domains of the time series, the proposed approach is able to extract more informative features from the data, enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish between different time series. To verify the effectiveness of the TF-FC method, we conducted experiments on four time series domain datasets (i.e., SleepEEG, HAR, Gesture, and Epilepsy). Experimental results show that TF-FC significantly improves in recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.">

        <tr id="Implicit graph neural networks have gained popularity in recent years as they capture long-range dependencies while improving predictive performance in static graphs. Despite the tussle between performance degradation due to the oversmoothing of learned embeddings and long-range dependency being more pronounced in dynamic graphs, as features are aggregated both across neighborhood and time, no prior work has proposed an implicit graph neural model in a dynamic setting. In this paper, we present Implicit Dynamic Graph Neural Network (IDGNN) a novel implicit neural network for dynamic graphs which is the first of its kind. A key characteristic of IDGNN is that it demonstrably is well-posed, i.e., it is theoretically guaranteed to have a fixed-point representation. We then demonstrate that the standard iterative algorithm often used to train implicit models is computationally expensive in our dynamic setting as it involves computing gradients, which themselves have to be estimated in an iterative manner. To overcome this, we pose an equivalent bilevel optimization problem and propose an efficient single-loop training algorithm that avoids iterative computation by maintaining moving averages of key components of the gradients. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets on both classification and regression tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art baselines. We also demonstrate that our bi-level optimization framework maintains the performance of the expensive iterative algorithm while obtaining up to \textbf{1600x} speed-up.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces BiLSTM-MLAM, a novel multi-scale time series prediction model. Initially, the approach utilizes bidirectional long short-term memory to capture information from both forward and backward directions in time series data. Subsequently, a multi-scale patch segmentation module generates various long sequences composed of equal-length segments, enabling the model to capture data patterns across multiple time scales by adjusting segment lengths. Finally, the local attention mechanism enhances feature extraction by accurately identifying and weighting important time segments, thereby strengthening the model’s understanding of the local features of the time series, followed by feature fusion. The model demonstrates outstanding performance in time series prediction tasks by effectively capturing sequence information across various time scales. Experimental validation illustrates the superior performance of BiLSTM-MLAM compared to six baseline methods across multiple datasets. When predicting the remaining life of aircraft engines, BiLSTM-MLAM outperforms the best baseline model by 6.66% in RMSE and 11.50% in MAE. In the LTE dataset, it achieves RMSE improvements of 12.77% and MAE enhancements of 3.06%, while in the load dataset, it demonstrates RMSE enhancements of 17.96% and MAE improvements of 30.39%. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the positive impact of each module on prediction accuracy. Through segment length parameter tuning experiments, combining different segment lengths has resulted in lower prediction errors, affirming the effectiveness of the multi-scale fusion strategy in enhancing prediction accuracy by integrating information from multiple time scales.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant method for analyzing graph-structured data. However, canonical GNNs have limited expressive power and generalization capability, thus triggering the development of more expressive yet computationally intensive methods. One such approach is to create a series of perturbed versions of input graphs and then repeatedly conduct multiple message-passing operations on all variations during training. Despite their expressive power, this approach does not scale well on larger graphs. To address this scalability issue, we introduce Scalable Expressiveness through Preprocessed Graph Perturbation (SE2P). This model offers a flexible, configurable balance between scalability and generalizability with four distinct configuration classes. At one extreme, the configuration prioritizes scalability through minimal learnable feature extraction and extensive preprocessing; at the other extreme, it enhances generalizability with more learnable feature extractions, though this increases scalability costs. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to evaluate the generalizability and scalability of SE2P variants compared to various state-of-the-art benchmarks. Our results indicate that, depending on the chosen SE2P configuration, the model can enhance generalizability compared to benchmarks while achieving significant speed improvements of up to 8-fold.">

However, current public datasets have limitations in reflecting the ultra-dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, characterized by continuously evolving infrastructures, varying temporal distributions, and temporal gaps due to sensor downtimes or changes in traffic patterns. These limitations inevitably restrict the practical applicability of existing traffic forecasting datasets. To bridge this gap, we present XXLTraffic, the largest available public traffic dataset with the longest timespan and increasing number of sensor nodes over the multiple years observed in the data, curated to support research in ultra-dynamic forecasting. Our benchmark includes both typical time-series forecasting settings with hourly and daily aggregated data and novel configurations that introduce gaps and down-sample the training size to better simulate practical constraints. We anticipate the new XXLTraffic will provide a fresh perspective for the time-series and traffic forecasting communities. It would also offer a robust platform for developing and evaluating models designed to tackle ultra-dynamic and extremely long forecasting problems. Our dataset supplements existing spatio-temporal data resources and leads to new research directions in this domain.">

        <tr id="Accurate evaluation of forecasting models is essential for ensuring reliable predictions. Current practices for evaluating and comparing forecasting models focus on summarising performance into a single score, using metrics such as SMAPE. We hypothesize that averaging performance over all samples dilutes relevant information about the relative performance of models. Particularly, conditions in which this relative performance is different than the overall accuracy. We address this limitation by proposing a novel framework for evaluating univariate time series forecasting models from multiple perspectives, such as one-step ahead forecasting versus multi-step ahead forecasting. We show the advantages of this framework by comparing a state-of-the-art deep learning approach with classical forecasting techniques. While classical methods (e.g. ARIMA) are long-standing approaches to forecasting, deep neural networks (e.g. NHITS) have recently shown state-of-the-art forecasting performance in benchmark datasets. We conducted extensive experiments that show NHITS generally performs best, but its superiority varies with forecasting conditions. For instance, concerning the forecasting horizon, NHITS only outperforms classical approaches for multi-step ahead forecasting. Another relevant insight is that, when dealing with anomalies, NHITS is outperformed by methods such as Theta. These findings highlight the importance of aspect-based model evaluation.">

Unlike previous approaches, GCFormer develops a hybrid token generator to create two types of token sequences, positive and negative, to capture diverse graph information. And a tailored Transformer-based backbone is adopted to learn meaningful node representations from these generated token sequences. Additionally, GCFormer introduces contrastive learning to extract valuable information from both positive and negative token sequences, enhancing the quality of learned node representations. Extensive experimental results across various datasets, including homophily and heterophily graphs, demonstrate the superiority of GCFormer in node classification, when compared to representative graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph Transformers.">

        <tr id="In terms of accuracy, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the best architectural choice for the node classification task. Their drawback in real-world deployment is the latency that emerges from the neighbourhood processing operation. One solution to the latency issue is to perform knowledge distillation from a trained GNN to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), where the MLP processes only the features of the node being classified (and possibly some pre-computed structural information). However, the performance of such MLPs in both transductive and inductive settings remains inconsistent for existing knowledge distillation techniques. We propose to address the performance concerns by using a specially-designed student model instead of an MLP. Our model, named Routing-by-Memory (RbM), is a form of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), with a design that enforces expert specialization. By encouraging each expert to specialize on a certain region on the hidden representation space, we demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to derive considerably more consistent performance across multiple datasets.">

        <tr id="Despite the success of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) in modeling real-world Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), challenges such as expressiveness limitations and over-smoothing have prompted researchers to explore Graph Transformers (GTs) for enhanced HIN representation learning. However, research on GT in HINs remains limited, with two key shortcomings in existing work: (1) A node's neighbors at different distances in HINs convey diverse semantics. Unfortunately, existing methods ignore such differences and uniformly treat neighbors within a given distance in a coarse manner, which results in semantic confusion. (2) Nodes in HINs have various types, each with unique semantics. Nevertheless, existing methods mix nodes of different types during neighbor aggregation, hindering the capture of proper correlations between nodes of diverse types. To bridge these gaps, we design an innovative structure named (k,t)-ring neighborhood, where nodes are initially organized by their distance, forming different non-overlapping k-ring neighborhoods for each distance. Within each k-ring structure, nodes are further categorized into different groups according to their types, thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of both distances and types in HINs naturally. Based on this structure, we propose a novel Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HHGT) model, which seamlessly integrates a Type-level Transformer for aggregating nodes of different types within each k-ring neighborhood, followed by a Ring-level Transformer for aggregating different k-ring neighborhoods in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on downstream tasks to verify HHGT's superiority over 14 baselines, with a notable improvement of up to 24.75% in NMI and 29.25% in ARI for node clustering task on the ACM dataset compared to the best baseline.">

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.">

To extract this latent information, existing methods condition the static and dynamic codes on the entire input sequence. Unfortunately, these models often suffer from information leakage, i.e., the dynamic vectors encode both static and dynamic information, or vice versa, leading to a non-disentangled representation. Attempts to alleviate this problem via reducing the dynamic dimension and auxiliary loss terms gain only partial success. Instead, we propose a novel and simple architecture that mitigates information leakage by offering a simple and effective subtraction inductive bias while conditioning on a single sample. Remarkably, the resulting variational framework is simpler in terms of required loss terms, hyperparameters, and data augmentation.

        <tr id="Time series generation is a crucial research topic in the area of deep learning, which can be used for data augmentation, imputing missing values, and forecasting. Currently, latent diffusion models are ascending to the forefront of generative modeling for many important data representations. Being the most pivotal in the computer vision domain, latent diffusion models have also recently attracted interest in other communities, including NLP, Speech, and Geometric Space. In this work, we propose TimeLDM, a novel latent diffusion model for high-quality time series generation. TimeLDM is composed of a variational autoencoder that encodes time series into an informative and smoothed latent content and a latent diffusion model operating in the latent space to generate latent information. We evaluate the ability of our method to generate synthetic time series with simulated and realistic datasets, benchmark the performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed TimeLDM persistently delivers high-quality generated time series. Sores from Context-FID and Discriminative indicate that TimeLDM consistently and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art benchmarks with an average improvement of 3.4$\times$ and 3.8$\times$, respectively. Further studies demonstrate that our method presents better performance on different lengths of time series data generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the potential of the latent diffusion model for unconditional time series generation and establish a new baseline for synthetic time series.">

        <tr id="The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

        <tr id="Dynamic link prediction is an important problem considered by many recent works proposing various approaches for learning temporal edge patterns. To assess their efficacy, models are evaluated on publicly available benchmark datasets involving continuous-time and discrete-time temporal graphs. However, as we show in this work, the suitability of common batch-oriented evaluation depends on the datasets' characteristics, which can cause two issues: First, for continuous-time temporal graphs, fixed-size batches create time windows with different durations, resulting in an inconsistent dynamic link prediction task. Second, for discrete-time temporal graphs, the sequence of batches can additionally introduce temporal dependencies that are not present in the data. In this work, we empirically show that this common evaluation approach leads to skewed model performance and hinders the fair comparison of methods. We mitigate this problem by reformulating dynamic link prediction as a link forecasting task that better accounts for temporal information present in the data. We provide implementations of our new evaluation method for commonly used graph learning frameworks.">

        <tr id="In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a potent tool for learning on graph-structured data and won fruitful successes in varied fields. The majority of GNNs follow the message-passing paradigm, where representations of each node are learned by recursively aggregating features of its neighbors. However, this mechanism brings severe over-smoothing and efficiency issues over high-degree graphs (HDGs), wherein most nodes have dozens (or even hundreds) of neighbors, such as social networks, transaction graphs, power grids, etc. Additionally, such graphs usually encompass rich and complex structure semantics, which are hard to capture merely by feature aggregations in GNNs. Motivated by the above limitations, we propose TADA, an efficient and effective front-mounted data augmentation framework for GNNs on HDGs. Under the hood, TADA includes two key modules: (i) feature expansion with structure embeddings, and (ii) topology- and attribute-aware graph sparsification. The former obtains augmented node features and enhanced model capacity by encoding the graph structure into high-quality structure embeddings with our highly-efficient sketching method. Further, by exploiting task-relevant features extracted from graph structures and attributes, the second module enables the accurate identification and reduction of numerous redundant/noisy edges from the input graph, thereby alleviating over-smoothing and facilitating faster feature aggregations over HDGs. Empirically, TADA considerably improves the predictive performance of mainstream GNN models on 8 real homophilic/heterophilic HDGs in terms of node classification, while achieving efficient training and inference processes.">

This paper explores fine-tuning LLMs for stock return forecasting with financial newsflow. In quantitative investing, return forecasting is fundamental for subsequent tasks like stock picking, portfolio optimization, etc. We formulate the model to include text representation and forecasting modules. We propose to compare the encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs, considering they generate text representations in distinct ways. The impact of these different representations on forecasting performance remains an open question. Meanwhile, we compare two simple methods of integrating LLMs' token-level representations into the forecasting module. The experiments on real news and investment universes reveal that: (1) aggregated representations from LLMs' token-level embeddings generally produce return predictions that enhance the performance of long-only and long-short portfolios; (2) in the relatively large investment universe, the decoder LLMs-based prediction model leads to stronger portfolios, whereas in the small universes, there are no consistent winners. Among the three LLMs studied (DeBERTa, Mistral, Llama), Mistral performs more robustly across different universes; (3) return predictions derived from LLMs' text representations are a strong signal for portfolio construction, outperforming conventional sentiment scores.">

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains unexplored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. TimeInf uses influence functions to attribute model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that TimeInf outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying harmful anomalies and helpful time points for forecasting.

        <tr id="Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated their remarkable performance in modeling temporal interaction graphs. These works can generate temporal node representations by encoding the surrounding neighborhoods for the target node. However, an inherent limitation of existing TGNs is their reliance on fixed, hand-crafted rules for neighborhood encoding, overlooking the necessity for an adaptive and learnable neighborhood that can accommodate both personalization and temporal evolution across different timestamps. In this paper, we aim to enhance existing TGNs by introducing an adaptive neighborhood encoding mechanism. We present SEAN, a flexible plug-and-play model that can be seamlessly integrated with existing TGNs, effectively boosting their performance. To achieve this, we decompose the adaptive neighborhood encoding process into two phases: (i) representative neighbor selection, and (ii) temporal-aware neighborhood information aggregation. Specifically, we propose the Representative Neighbor Selector component, which automatically pinpoints the most important neighbors for the target node. It offers a tailored understanding of each node's unique surrounding context, facilitating personalization. Subsequently, we propose a Temporal-aware Aggregator, which synthesizes neighborhood aggregation by selectively determining the utilization of aggregation routes and decaying the outdated information, allowing our model to adaptively leverage both the contextually significant and current information during aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments by integrating SEAN into three representative TGNs, evaluating their performance on four public datasets and one financial benchmark dataset introduced in this paper. The results demonstrate that SEAN consistently leads to performance improvements across all models, achieving SOTA performance and exceptional robustness.">

To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed, including graph meta-learning, transfer learning, and methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs).

However, existing CTDG models encounter challenges stemming from noise and limited historical data.

Moreover, these methods often demand substantial domain expertise for parameter tuning and lack theoretical guarantees for augmentation efficacy. To address these issues, we propose Conda, a novel latent diffusion-based GDA method tailored for CTDGs. Conda features a sandwich-like architecture, incorporating a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and a conditional diffusion model, aimed at generating enhanced historical neighbor embeddings for target nodes. Unlike conventional diffusion models trained on entire graphs via pre-training, Conda requires historical neighbor sequence embeddings of target nodes for training, thus facilitating more targeted augmentation. We integrate Conda into the CTDG model and adopt an alternating training strategy to optimize performance.

        <tr id="Limited by the scale and diversity of time series data, the neural networks trained on time series data often overfit and show unsatisfacotry performances. In comparison, large language models (LLMs) recently exhibit impressive generalization in diverse fields. Although massive LLM based approaches are proposed for time series tasks, these methods require to load the whole LLM in both training and reference. This high computational demands limit practical applications in resource-constrained settings, like edge-computing and IoT devices. To address this issue, we propose Knowledge Pruning (KP), a novel paradigm for time series learning in this paper. For a specific downstream task, we argue that the world knowledge learned by LLMs is much redundant and only the related knowledge termed as"pertinent knowledge"is useful. Unlike other methods, our KP targets to prune the redundant knowledge and only distill the pertinent knowledge into the target model. This reduces model size and computational costs significantly. Additionally, different from existing LLM based approaches, our KP does not require to load the LLM in the process of training and testing, further easing computational burdens. With our proposed KP, a lightweight network can effectively learn the pertinent knowledge, achieving satisfactory performances with a low computation cost. To verify the effectiveness of our KP, two fundamental tasks on edge-computing devices are investigated in our experiments, where eight diverse environments or benchmarks with different networks are used to verify the generalization of our KP. Through experiments, our KP demonstrates effective learning of pertinent knowledge, achieving notable performance improvements in regression (19.7% on average) and classification (up to 13.7%) tasks, showcasing state-of-the-art results.">

Our experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that GKAN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks. In addition to the improved accuracy, GKAN's design inherently provides clear insights into the model's decision-making process, eliminating the need for post-hoc explainability techniques.

        <tr id="Temporal causal discovery is a crucial task aimed at uncovering the causal relations within time series data. The latest temporal causal discovery methods usually train deep learning models on prediction tasks to uncover the causality between time series. They capture causal relations by analyzing the parameters of some components of the trained models, e.g., attention weights and convolution weights. However, this is an incomplete mapping process from the model parameters to the causality and fails to investigate the other components, e.g., fully connected layers and activation functions, that are also significant for causal discovery. To facilitate the utilization of the whole deep learning models in temporal causal discovery, we proposed an interpretable transformer-based causal discovery model termed CausalFormer, which consists of the causality-aware transformer and the decomposition-based causality detector. The causality-aware transformer learns the causal representation of time series data using a prediction task with the designed multi-kernel causal convolution which aggregates each input time series along the temporal dimension under the temporal priority constraint. Then, the decomposition-based causality detector interprets the global structure of the trained causality-aware transformer with the proposed regression relevance propagation to identify potential causal relations and finally construct the causal graph. Experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CausalFormer on discovering temporal causality.

        <tr id="Sequential recommendation systems aim to provide personalized recommendations by analyzing dynamic preferences and dependencies within user behavior sequences. Recently, Transformer models can effectively capture user preferences. However, their quadratic computational complexity limits recommendation performance on long interaction sequence data. Inspired by the State Space Model (SSM)representative model, Mamba, which efficiently captures user preferences in long interaction sequences with linear complexity, we find that Mamba's recommendation effectiveness is limited in short interaction sequences, with failing to recall items of actual interest to users and exacerbating the data sparsity cold start problem. To address this issue, we innovatively propose a new model, MaTrRec, which combines the strengths of Mamba and Transformer. This model fully leverages Mamba's advantages in handling long-term dependencies and Transformer's global attention advantages in short-term dependencies, thereby enhances predictive capabilities on both long and short interaction sequence datasets while balancing model efficiency. Notably, our model significantly improves the data sparsity cold start problem, with an improvement of up to 33% on the highly sparse Amazon Musical Instruments dataset. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on five widely used public datasets. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models on all five datasets.

Traditional time-series models segment data into windows and assign one label per window, often missing label transitions within those windows. This paper presents a novel many-to-many time-series model and post-processing using hybrid recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms, which more effectively captures label transitions over traditional many-to-one models. Further, unlike typical other many-to-many models, our approach doesn’t require a decoder. Instead, it employs an RNN, generating a label for every input time step. During inference, a weighted voting scheme consolidates overlapping predictions into one label per time step. Experiments show our model remains effective on time-series with sparse label shifts, but particularly excels in detecting frequent transitions. This model is ideal for tasks demanding accurate pinpointing of rapid label changes in time-series data, such as gesture recognition, making it ideal for fast-paced human activity recognition. 1">

These models typically involve a decoder trained using either its previous forecasts or the actual observed values as the decoder inputs. However, relying on self-generated predictions can lead to the rapid accumulation of errors over multiple steps, while using the actual observations introduces exposure bias as these values are unavailable during the extrapolation stage. In this regard, this study proposes a novel training approach called reinforced decoder, which introduces auxiliary models to generate alternative decoder inputs that remain accessible when extrapolating. Additionally, a reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to dynamically select the optimal inputs to improve accuracy.

        <tr id="The modelling of temporal patterns in dynamic graphs is an important current research issue in the development of time-aware GNNs. Whether or not a specific sequence of events in a temporal graph constitutes a temporal pattern not only depends on the frequency of its occurrence. We consider whether it deviates from what is expected in a temporal graph where timestamps are randomly shuffled. While accounting for such a random baseline is important to model temporal patterns, it has mostly been ignored by current temporal graph neural networks. To address this issue we propose HYPA-DBGNN, a novel two-step approach that combines (i) the inference of anomalous sequential patterns in time series data on graphs based on a statistically principled null model, with (ii) a neural message passing approach that utilizes a higher-order De Bruijn graph whose edges capture overrepresented sequential patterns. Our method leverages hypergeometric graph ensembles to identify anomalous edges within both first- and higher-order De Bruijn graphs, which encode the temporal ordering of events. The model introduces an inductive bias that enhances model interpretability. We evaluate our approach for static node classification using benchmark datasets and a synthetic dataset that showcases its ability to incorporate the observed inductive bias regarding over- and under-represented temporal edges. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in detecting similar patterns within empirical datasets, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods in node classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce statistically informed GNNs that leverage temporal and causal sequence anomalies. HYPA-DBGNN represents a path for bridging the gap between statistical graph inference and neural graph representation learning, with potential applications to static GNNs.">

        <tr id="Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting. Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various input formats and retrieval augmented generation(RAG) modules. From extensive experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast, incorporating raw texts in specific complex events and fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance. Moreover, enhanced with retrieval modules, LLM can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. Meanwhile, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem still persist in LLMs, particularly in the RAG-based method. These findings not only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also highlight several promising research directions.We consider that this comprehensive evaluation, along with the identified research opportunities, will significantly contribute to future research on temporal event forecasting through LLMs.">

However, the practical deployment of LLMs in resource-limited environments often requires further model compression, such as quantization and pruning. While these techniques are well-established for attention-based models, their effects on recurrent layers remain underexplored. In this preliminary work, we focus on post-training quantization for recurrent LLMs and show that Mamba models exhibit the same pattern of outlier channels observed in attention-based LLMs. We show that the reason for the difficulty of quantizing SSMs is caused by activation outliers, similar to those observed in transformer-based LLMs. We report baseline results for post-training quantization of Mamba that do not take into account the activation outliers and suggest first steps for outlier-aware quantization.">

        <tr id="In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto tool for learning node and graph representations. Most GNNs typically consist of a sequence of neighborhood aggregation (a.k.a., message passing) layers. Within each of these layers, the representation of each node is updated from an aggregation and transformation of its neighbours representations at the previous layer. The upper bound for the expressive power of message passing GNNs was reached through the use of MLPs as a transformation, due to their universal approximation capabilities. However, MLPs suffer from well-known limitations, which recently motivated the introduction of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). KANs rely on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, rendering them a promising alternative to MLPs. In this work, we compare the performance of KANs against that of MLPs in graph learning tasks. We perform extensive experiments on node classification, graph classification and graph regression datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that while KANs are on-par with MLPs in classification tasks, they seem to have a clear advantage in the graph regression tasks.

        <tr id="How to capture dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies remains an open question in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Although recent advanced spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) achieve superior forecasting performance, they either consider pre-defined spatial correlations or simply learn static graphs. Some research has tried to learn many adjacent matrices to reveal time-varying spatial correlations, but they generate discrete graphs which cannot encode evolutionary information and also face computational complexity problem. In this paper, we propose two significant plugins to help automatically learn enhanced dynamic spatial-temporal embedding of MTS data: (1) a novel neural conditional random field (CRF) layer. We find that the implicit time-varying spatial dependencies are reflected by the explicit changeable links between edges, and we propose the neural CRF to encode such pairwise changeable evolutionary inter-dependencies; (2) a structure adaptive graph convolution (SAGC) that does not require pre-defined graphs to capture semantically richer spatial correlations. Then, we integrate the neural CRF, SAGC with recurrent neural network to develop a new STGNN paradigm termed Adaptive Spatial-Temporal graph neural network with Conditional Random Field (ASTCRF), which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. We validate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of ASTCRF on five public benchmark MTS datasets.">

        <tr id="Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is crucial for various sectors, including aviation, agriculture, energy, and disaster preparedness. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of weather predictions by optimizing models based on public meteorological data. However, existing public datasets for GSWF optimization and benchmarking still suffer from significant limitations, such as small sizes, limited temporal coverage, and a lack of comprehensive variables. These shortcomings prevent them from effectively reflecting the benchmarks of current forecasting methods and fail to support the real needs of operational weather forecasting. To address these challenges, we present the WEATHER-5K dataset. This dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of data from 5,672 weather stations worldwide, spanning a 10-year period with one-hour intervals. It includes multiple crucial weather elements, providing a more reliable and interpretable resource for forecasting. Furthermore, our WEATHER-5K dataset can serve as a benchmark for comprehensively evaluating existing well-known forecasting models, extending beyond GSWF methods to support future time-series research challenges and opportunities. The dataset and benchmark implementation are publicly available at: https://github.com/taohan10200/WEATHER-5K.">

        <tr id="Financial assets exhibit complex dependency structures, which are crucial for investors to create diversified portfolios to mitigate risk in volatile financial markets. To explore the financial asset dependencies dynamics, we propose a novel approach that models the dependencies of assets as an Asset Dependency Matrix (ADM) and treats the ADM sequences as image sequences. This allows us to leverage deep learning-based video prediction methods to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among assets. However, unlike images where neighboring pixels exhibit explicit spatiotemporal dependencies due to the natural continuity of object movements, assets in ADM do not have a natural order. This poses challenges to organizing the relational assets to reveal better the spatiotemporal dependencies among neighboring assets for ADM forecasting. To tackle the challenges, we propose the Asset Dependency Neural Network (ADNN), which employs the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, a highly successful method for video prediction. ADNN can employ static and dynamic transformation functions to optimize the representations of the ADM. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms the baselines in the ADM prediction and downstream application tasks. This research contributes to understanding and predicting asset dependencies, offering valuable insights for financial market participants.">

        <tr id="Sequential recommendation aims to recommend the next items that a target user may have interest in based on the user’s sequence of past behaviors, which has become a hot research topic in both academia and industry. In the literature, sequential recommendation adopts a Sequence-to-Item or Sequence-to-Sequence training strategy, which supervises a sequential model with a user’s next one or more behaviors as the labels and the sequence of the past behaviors as the input. However, existing powerful sequential recommendation approaches employ more and more complex deep structures such as Transformer in order to accurately capture the sequential patterns, which heavily rely on hand-crafted designs on key attention mechanism to achieve state-of-the-art performance, thus failing to automatically obtain the optimal design of attention representation architectures in various scenarios with different data. Other works on classic automated deep recommender systems only focus on traditional settings, ignoring the problem of sequential scenarios. In this paper, we study the problem of automated sequential recommendation, which faces two main challenges: i) How can we design a proper search space tailored for attention automation in sequential recommendation, and ii) How can we accurately search effective attention representation architectures considering multiple user interests reflected in the sequential behavior. To tackle these challenges, we propose an automated disentangled sequential recommendation (AutoDisenSeq) model. In particular, we employ neural architecture search (NAS) and design a search space tailored for automated attention representation in attentive intention-disentangled sequential recommendation with an expressive and efficient space complexity of \(O(n^{2})\) given \(n\) as the number of layers. We further propose a context-aware parameter sharing mechanism taking characteristics of each sub-architecture into account to enable accurate architecture performance estimations and great flexibility for disentanglement of latent intention representation. Moreover, we propose AutoDisenSeq-LLM, which utilizes the textual understanding power of large language model (LLM) as a guidance to refine the candidate list for recommendation from AutoDisenSeq. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our proposed AutoDisenSeq model and AutoDisenSeq-LLM model outperform existing baseline methods on four real-world datasets in both overall recommendation and cold-start recommendation scenarios.">

        <tr id="Time Series Classification (TSC) encompasses two settings: classifying entire sequences or classifying segmented subsequences. The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of Con4m in handling segmented TSC tasks on MVD.">

        <tr id="Stock price forecasting is a challenging area of research, particularly due to the complexity and unpredictability of financial markets. The accuracy of prediction models is influenced by various factors, including nonlinearity, seasonality, and economic shocks. Deep learning has demonstrated better forecasts of stock prices than traditional approaches. This study, therefore, proposed a new approach to improve forecasting system based on an end-to-end convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with attention mechanism. Our approach first investigates local stock price features using 1D convolutional neural network, and then employs a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network for forecasting. This model stands out by effectively utilizing contextual data and representing the temporal character of data. The Bi-LSTM is helpful for understanding the history and future contextual information since it uncovers both past and future contexts of stock data. Furthermore, integrating attention mechanism within the CRNN represents a significant improvement. This allows our model to handle long input sequences more effectively and capture the inherent stochasticity in stock prices, which is often missed by traditional models. The effectiveness of our approach is investigated using data on 10 stock indexes from Yahoo Finance. The results show that our method outperforms ARIMA, LSTM, and conventional methods. ">

This method improves the model's ability to capture dependencies between high-level abstract features and low-level details. By facilitating direct attention between these diverse feature levels, our approach overcomes the limitations of current Transformers, which often rely on suboptimal intra-layer attention. Our implementation extends the Transformer's functionality by enabling queries in a given layer to interact with keys and values from both the current layer and one preceding layer, thus enhancing the diversity of multi-head attention without additional computational burden. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our enhanced Transformer model achieves superior performance in language modeling tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our skip-layer attention mechanism.">

This study proposes a multi-scale graph wavelet temporal convolution network (MSGWTCN) to predict the traffic states in complex transportation networks. Specifically, a multi-scale spatial block is designed to simultaneously capture the spatial information at different levels, and the gated temporal convolution network is employed to extract the temporal dependencies of the data. The model jointly learns to mount multiple levels of the spatial interactions by stacking graph wavelets with different scales. Two real-world datasets are used in this study to investigate the model performance, including a highway network in Seattle and a dense road network of Manhattan in New York City. Experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models. Furthermore, different scales of graph wavelets are found to be effective in extracting local, intermediate and global information at the same time and thus enable the model to learn a complex transportation network topology with various types of road segments. By carefully customizing the scales of wavelets, the model is able to improve the prediction performance and better adapt to different network configurations.">

        <tr id="Many of today's data is time-series data originating from various sources, such as sensors, transaction systems, or production systems. Major challenges with such data include privacy and business sensitivity. Generative time-series models have the potential to overcome these problems, allowing representative synthetic data, such as people's movement in cities, to be shared openly and be used to the benefit of society at large. However, contemporary approaches are limited to prohibitively short sequences and small scales. Aside from major memory limitations, the models generate less accurate and less representative samples the longer the sequences are. This issue is further exacerbated by the lack of a comprehensive and accessible benchmark. Furthermore, a common need in practical applications is what-if analysis and dynamic adaptation to data distribution changes, for usage in decision making and to manage a changing world: What if this road is temporarily blocked or another road is added? The focus of this paper is on mobility data, such as people's movement in cities, requiring all these issues to be addressed. To this end, we propose a transformer-based diffusion model, TDDPM, for time-series which outperforms and scales substantially better than state-of-the-art. This is evaluated in a new comprehensive benchmark across several sequence lengths, standard datasets, and evaluation measures. We also demonstrate how the model can be conditioned on a prior over spatial occupancy frequency information, allowing the model to generate mobility data for previously unseen environments and for hypothetical scenarios where the underlying road network and its usage changes. This is evaluated by training on mobility data from part of a city. Then, using only aggregate spatial information as prior, we demonstrate out-of-distribution generalization to the unobserved remainder of the city.">

In this paper, we propose stableKT to enhance length generalization that is able to learn from short sequences and maintain high prediction performance when generalizing on long sequences.

        <tr id="Real-world data generation often involves certain geometries (e.g., graphs) that induce instance-level interdependence. This characteristic makes the generalization of learning models more difficult due to the intricate interdependent patterns that impact data-generative distributions and can vary from training to testing. In this work, we propose a geometric diffusion model with learnable divergence fields for the challenging generalization problem with interdependent data. We generalize the diffusion equation with stochastic diffusivity at each time step, which aims to capture the multi-faceted information flows among interdependent data. Furthermore, we derive a new learning objective through causal inference, which can guide the model to learn generalizable patterns of interdependence that are insensitive across domains. Regarding practical implementation, we introduce three model instantiations that can be considered as the generalized versions of GCN, GAT, and Transformers, respectively, which possess advanced robustness against distribution shifts. We demonstrate their promising efficacy for out-of-distribution generalization on diverse real-world datasets.">

        <tr id="To generate coherent responses, language models infer unobserved meaning from their input text sequence. One potential explanation for this capability arises from theories of delay embeddings in dynamical systems, which prove that unobserved variables can be recovered from the history of only a handful of observed variables. To test whether language models are effectively constructing delay embeddings, we measure the capacities of sequence models to reconstruct unobserved dynamics. We trained 1-layer transformer decoders and state-space sequence models on next-step prediction from noisy, partially-observed time series data. We found that each sequence layer can learn a viable embedding of the underlying system. However, state-space models have a stronger inductive bias than transformers-in particular, they more effectively reconstruct unobserved information at initialization, leading to more parameter-efficient models and lower error on dynamics tasks. Our work thus forges a novel connection between dynamical systems and deep learning sequence models via delay embedding theory.">

Our framework directs the LLMs to create background knowledge through a fill-in-the-blank strategy and then discerns potential factors affecting stock prices from related news. Guided by background knowledge and identified factors, we leverage historical stock prices in textual format to predict stock movement.

This training paradigm over diverse well-curated data lies at the heart of generating creative and sensible content. However, all previous graph generative models (e.g., GraphRNN, MDVAE, MoFlow, GDSS, and DiGress) have been trained only on one dataset each time, which cannot replicate the revolutionary success achieved by LGMs in other fields. To remedy this crucial gap, we propose a new class of graph generative model called Large Graph Generative Model (LGGM) that is trained on a large corpus of graphs (over 5000 graphs) from 13 different domains. We empirically demonstrate that the pre-trained LGGM has superior zero-shot generative capability to existing graph generative models. Furthermore, our pre-trained LGGM can be easily fine-tuned with graphs from target domains and demonstrate even better performance than those directly trained from scratch, behaving as a solid starting point for real-world customization. Inspired by Stable Diffusion, we further equip LGGM with the capability to generate graphs given text prompts (Text-to-Graph), such as the description of the network name and domain (i.e.,"The power-1138-bus graph represents a network of buses in a power distribution system."), and network statistics (i.e.,"The graph has a low average degree, suitable for modeling social media interactions."). This Text-to-Graph capability integrates the extensive world knowledge in the underlying language model, offering users fine-grained control of the generated graphs.

Existing XGNNs predominantly adopt the attention-based mechanism to learn edge or node importance for extracting and making predictions with the interpretable subgraph. However, the representational properties and limitations of these methods remain inadequately explored. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that formulates interpretable subgraph learning with the multilinear extension of the subgraph distribution, coined as subgraph multilinear extension (SubMT). Extracting the desired interpretable subgraph requires an accurate approximation of SubMT, yet we find that the existing XGNNs can have a huge gap in fitting SubMT. Consequently, the SubMT approximation failure will lead to the degenerated interpretability of the extracted subgraphs. To mitigate the issue, we design a new XGNN architecture called Graph Multilinear neT (GMT), which is provably more powerful in approximating SubMT. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks.

Currently, two prominent model types, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have demonstrated performance advantages on distinct tabular prediction tasks. However, selecting an effective model for a specific tabular dataset is challenging, often demanding time-consuming hyperparameter tuning. To address this model selection dilemma, this paper proposes a new framework that amalgamates the advantages of both GBDTs and DNNs, resulting in a DNN algorithm that is as efficient as GBDTs and is competitively effective regardless of dataset preferences for GBDTs or DNNs. Our idea is rooted in an observation that deep learning (DL) offers a larger parameter space that can represent a well-performing GBDT model, yet the current back-propagation optimizer struggles to efficiently discover such optimal functionality. On the other hand, during GBDT development, hard tree pruning, entropy-driven feature gate, and model ensemble have proved to be more adaptable to tabular data. By combining these key components, we present a Tree-hybrid simple MLP (T-MLP). In our framework, a tensorized, rapidly trained GBDT feature gate, a DNN architecture pruning approach, as well as a vanilla back-propagation optimizer collaboratively train a randomly initialized MLP model. Comprehensive experiments show that T-MLP is competitive with extensively tuned DNNs and GBDTs in their dominating tabular benchmarks (88 datasets) respectively, all achieved with compact model storage and significantly reduced training duration.">

While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to existing approaches.">

In recent years, researchers have primarily concentrated on developing specific model architectures for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) in order to improve the representation quality of temporal nodes and edges. However, limited attention has been given to the quality of negative samples during the training of TGNNs. When compared with static networks, temporal networks present two specific challenges for negative sampling: positive sparsity and positive shift. Positive sparsity refers to the presence of a single positive sample amidst numerous negative samples at each timestamp, while positive shift relates to the variations in positive samples across different timestamps. To robustly address these challenges in training TGNNs, we introduce Curriculum Negative Mining (CurNM), a model-aware curriculum learning framework that adaptively adjusts the difficulty of negative samples. Within this framework, we first establish a dynamically updated negative pool that balances random, historical, and hard negatives to address the challenges posed by positive sparsity. Secondly, we implement a temporal-aware negative selection module that focuses on learning from the disentangled factors of recently active edges, thus accurately capturing shifting preferences. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets and 3 TGNNs demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin. Additionally, thorough ablation studies and parameter sensitivity experiments verify the usefulness and robustness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/zziyue83/CurNM.">

        <tr id="Transformers can under some circumstances generalize to novel problem instances whose constituent parts might have been encountered during training but whose compositions have not. What mechanisms underlie this ability for compositional generalization? By reformulating multi-head attention as a hypernetwork, we reveal that a low-dimensional latent code specifies key-query specific operations. We find empirically that this latent code is highly structured, capturing information about the subtasks performed by the network. Using the framework of attention as a hypernetwork we further propose a simple modification of multi-head linear attention that strengthens the ability for compositional generalization on a range of abstract reasoning tasks. In particular, we introduce a symbolic version of the Raven Progressive Matrices human intelligence test on which we demonstrate how scaling model size and data enables compositional generalization and gives rise to a functionally structured latent code in the transformer.">

In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of generative models for industrial time series from deep generative models (DGMs) to large generative models (LGMs). First, a DGM-based AIGC framework is proposed for industrial time series generation. Within this framework, we survey advanced industrial DGMs and present a multi-perspective categorization. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the critical technologies required to construct industrial LGMs from four aspects: large-scale industrial dataset, LGMs architecture for complex industrial characteristics, self-supervised training for industrial time series, and fine-tuning of industrial downstream tasks. Finally, we conclude the challenges and future directions to enable the development of generative models in industry.">

Despite the recent surge in graph pooling approaches, there is a lack of standardized experimental settings and fair benchmarks to evaluate their performance. To address this issue, we have constructed a comprehensive benchmark that includes 15 graph pooling methods and 21 different graph datasets. This benchmark systematically assesses the performance of graph pooling methods in three dimensions, i.e., effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. We first evaluate the performance of these graph pooling approaches across different tasks including graph classification, graph regression and node classification. Then, we investigate their performance under potential noise attacks and out-of-distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. We also involve detailed efficiency analysis and parameter analysis. Extensive experiments validate the strong capability and applicability of graph pooling approaches in various scenarios, which can provide valuable insights and guidance for deep geometric learning research.

This limitation leads to substantial environmental and economic waste. In this study, we introduce the PMoE, Progressive Mixture of Experts with Asymmetric Transformer, which aims to minimize forgetting by utilizing an asymmetric design with shallow layers dedicated to general knowledge and deep layers for new knowledge. PMoE incorporates progressively added experts in deep layers and a router that allocates new knowledge to the appropriate experts efficiently. The router, positioned adjacent to the deep layers, utilizes deep features aggregating consolidated information. This enables the router to perform efficiently, allocating new knowledge to the appropriate experts, which progressively increase in the deep layers.

        <tr id="Graph Neural Network (GNN) achieves great success for node-level and graph-level tasks via encoding meaningful topological structures of networks in various domains, ranging from social to biological networks. However, repeated aggregation operations lead to excessive mixing of node representations, particularly in dense regions with multiple GNN layers, resulting in nearly indistinguishable embeddings. This phenomenon leads to the oversmoothing problem that hampers downstream graph analytics tasks. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel and flexible truss-based graph sparsification model that prunes edges from dense regions of the graph. Pruning redundant edges in dense regions helps to prevent the aggregation of excessive neighborhood information during hierarchical message passing and pooling in GNN models. We then utilize our sparsification model in the state-of-the-art baseline GNNs and pooling models, such as GIN, SAGPool, GMT, DiffPool, MinCutPool, HGP-SL, DMonPool, and AdamGNN. Extensive experiments on different real-world datasets show that our model significantly improves the performance of the baseline GNN models in the graph classification task.">

To address these challenges, we introduce Temporal Graph Benchmark 2.0 (TGB 2.0), a novel benchmarking framework tailored for evaluating methods for predicting future links on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs with a focus on large-scale datasets, extending the Temporal Graph Benchmark. TGB 2.0 facilitates comprehensive evaluations by presenting eight novel datasets spanning five domains with up to 53 million edges. TGB 2.0 datasets are significantly larger than existing datasets in terms of number of nodes, edges, or timestamps. In addition, TGB 2.0 provides a reproducible and realistic evaluation pipeline for multi-relational temporal graphs. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that 1) leveraging edge-type information is crucial to obtain high performance, 2) simple heuristic baselines are often competitive with more complex methods, 3) most methods fail to run on our largest datasets, highlighting the need for research on more scalable methods.">

In sequential recommendation, pre-training from user historical behaviors through self-supervised learning can better comprehend user dynamic preferences, presenting the potential for direct integration with CTR tasks. Previous methods have integrated pre-trained models into downstream tasks with the sole purpose of extracting semantic information or well-represented user features, which are then incorporated as new features. However, these approaches tend to ignore the additional inference costs to the downstream tasks, and they do not consider how to transfer the effective information from the pre-trained models for specific estimated items in CTR prediction. In this paper, we propose a Sequential Recommendation Pre-training framework for CTR prediction (SRP4CTR) to tackle the above problems. Initially, we discuss the impact of introducing pre-trained models on inference costs. Subsequently, we introduced a pre-trained method to encode sequence side information concurrently.During the fine-tuning process, we incorporate a cross-attention block to establish a bridge between estimated items and the pre-trained model at a low cost. Moreover, we develop a querying transformer technique to facilitate the knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model to industrial CTR models.

This paper proposes adapting an established model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm for short-term load forecasting in the context of few-shot learning. Specifically, the proposed method can rapidly adapt and generalize within any unknown load time series of arbitrary length using only minimal training samples. In this context, the meta-learning model learns an optimal set of initial parameters for a base-level learner recurrent neural network. The proposed model is evaluated using a dataset of historical load consumption data from real-world consumers. Despite the examined load series' short length, it produces accurate forecasts outperforming transfer learning and task-specific machine learning methods by $12.5\%$. To enhance robustness and fairness during model evaluation, a novel metric, mean average log percentage error, is proposed that alleviates the bias introduced by the commonly used MAPE metric. Finally, a series of studies to evaluate the model's robustness under different hyperparameters and time series lengths is also conducted, demonstrating that the proposed approach consistently outperforms all other models.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has essential applications across various domains. For instance, forecasting power time series can optimize energy usage and bolster grid stability and reliability. Existing models based on transformer architecture are limited to classical design, ignoring the impact of spatial information and noise on model architecture design. Therefore, we propose an atypical design of Transformer-based models for multivariate time series forecasting. This design consists of two critical components: (i) spectral clustering center of time series employed as the focal point for attention computation; (ii) alternating attention mechanism wherein each query transformer is compatible with spectral clustering centers, executing attention at the sequence level instead of the token level. The alternating design has a two-fold benefit: firstly, it eliminates the uncertainty noise present in the dependent variable sequence of the channel input, and secondly, it incorporates the Euclidean distance to mitigate the impact of extreme values on the attention matrix, thereby aligning predictions more closely to the sequence's natural progression. Experiments on ten real-world datasets, encompassing Wind, Electricity, Weather, and others, demonstrate that our Spectral Central Alternating Transformer (SCAT) outperforms state-of-the-art methods (SOTA) by an average of 42.8% in prediction performance in power time series forecasting.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based methods have recently demonstrated their potential in time series forecasting problems. However, the mainstream approach, primarily utilizing attention to model inter-step correlation in the time domain, is constrained by two significant issues that lead to ineffective and inefficient multivariate forecasting. The first is that key representations in the time domain are scattered and sparse, resulting in parameter bloat and increased difficulty in capturing time dependencies. The second is that treating time step points as uniformly embedded tokens leads to the erasure of inter-variate correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a frequency-wise and variables-oriented transformer-based method. This method leverages the intrinsic conjugate symmetry in the frequency domain, enabling compact frequency domain representations that naturally mix information across time points while reducing spatio-temporal costs. Multivariate inter-correlations can also be captured from similar frequency domain components, which enhances the variables-oriented attention mechanism modeling capability. Further, we employ both polar and complex domain perspectives to enrich the frequency domain representations and decode complicated temporal patterns. We propose frequency-enhanced independent representation multi-head attention (FIR-Attention) to leverage these advantages for improved multivariate interaction. Techniques such as cutting-off frequency and equivalent mapping are used to ensure the model’s lightweight nature. Extensive experiments on eight mainstream datasets show that our approach achieves first-rate satisfactory results and, importantly, requires only one percent of the spatio-temporal cost of mainstream methods.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in numerous graph analytical tasks. Yet, their effectiveness is often compromised in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts, limiting their capacity for knowledge transfer across changing environments or domains. Recently, Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) has been introduced to resolve this issue. UGDA aims to facilitate knowledge transfer from a labeled source graph to an unlabeled target graph. Current UGDA efforts primarily focus on model-centric methods, such as employing domain invariant learning strategies and designing model architectures. However, our critical examination reveals the limitations inherent to these model-centric methods, while a data-centric method allowed to modify the source graph provably demonstrates considerable potential. This insight motivates us to explore UGDA from a data-centric perspective. By revisiting the theoretical generalization bound for UGDA, we identify two data-centric principles for UGDA: alignment principle and rescaling principle. Guided by these principles, we propose GraphAlign, a novel UGDA method that generates a small yet transferable graph. By exclusively training a GNN on this new graph with classic Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), GraphAlign attains exceptional performance on the target graph. Extensive experiments under various transfer scenarios demonstrate the GraphAlign outperforms the best baselines by an average of 2.16%, training on the generated graph as small as 0.25~1% of the original training graph.">

        <tr id="Probabilistic forecasting models for joint distributions of targets in irregular time series are a heavily under-researched area in machine learning with, to the best of our knowledge, only three models researched so far: GPR, the Gaussian Process Regression model~\citep{Durichen2015.Multitask}, TACTiS, the Transformer-Attentional Copulas for Time Series~\cite{Drouin2022.Tactis, ashok2024tactis} and ProFITi \citep{Yalavarthi2024.Probabilistica}, a multivariate normalizing flow model based on invertible attention layers. While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is the more expressive model with better predictive performance, we will show that it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: it does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. Also, TACTiS does not provide any guarantees for marginalization consistency. We develop a novel probabilistic irregular time series forecasting model, Marginalization Consistent Mixtures of Separable Flows (moses), that mixes several normalizing flows with (i) Gaussian Processes with full covariance matrix as source distributions and (ii) a separable invertible transformation, aiming to combine the expressivity of normalizing flows with the marginalization consistency of Gaussians. In experiments on four different datasets we show that moses outperforms other state-of-the-art marginalization consistent models, performs on par with ProFITi, but different from ProFITi, guarantee marginalization consistency.">

        <tr id="This paper addresses the challenge of incremental learning in growing graphs with increasingly complex tasks. The goal is to continually train a graph model to handle new tasks while retaining its inference ability on previous tasks. Existing methods usually neglect the importance of memory diversity, limiting in effectively selecting high-quality memory from previous tasks and remembering broad previous knowledge within the scarce memory on graphs. To address that, we introduce a novel holistic Diversified Memory Selection and Generation (DMSG) framework for incremental learning in graphs, which first introduces a buffer selection strategy that considers both intra-class and inter-class diversities, employing an efficient greedy algorithm for sampling representative training nodes from graphs into memory buffers after learning each new task. Then, to adequately rememorize the knowledge preserved in the memory buffer when learning new tasks, we propose a diversified memory generation replay method. This method first utilizes a variational layer to generate the distribution of buffer node embeddings and sample synthesized ones for replaying. Furthermore, an adversarial variational embedding learning method and a reconstruction-based decoder are proposed to maintain the integrity and consolidate the generalization of the synthesized node embeddings, respectively. Finally, we evaluate our model on node classification tasks involving increasing class numbers. Extensive experimental results on publicly accessible datasets demonstrate the superiority of DMSG over state-of-the-art methods.">

        <tr id="We introduce Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (GKAN), an innovative neural network architecture that extends the principles of the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to graph-structured data. By adopting the unique characteristics of KANs, notably the use of learnable univariate functions instead of fixed linear weights, we develop a powerful model for graph-based learning tasks. Unlike traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that rely on a fixed convolutional architecture, GKANs implement learnable spline-based functions between layers, transforming the way information is processed across the graph structure. We present two different ways to incorporate KAN layers into GKAN: architecture 1 -- where the learnable functions are applied to input features after aggregation and architecture 2 -- where the learnable functions are applied to input features before aggregation. We evaluate GKAN empirically using a semi-supervised graph learning task on a real-world dataset (Cora). We find that architecture generally performs better. We find that GKANs achieve higher accuracy in semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs compared to the traditional GCN model. For example, when considering 100 features, GCN provides an accuracy of 53.5 while a GKAN with a comparable number of parameters gives an accuracy of 61.76; with 200 features, GCN provides an accuracy of 61.24 while a GKAN with a comparable number of parameters gives an accuracy of 67.66. We also present results on the impact of various parameters such as the number of hidden nodes, grid-size, and the polynomial-degree of the spline on the performance of GKAN.">

        <tr id="Forecasting multivariate time series is a computationally intensive task challenged by extreme or redundant samples. Recent resampling methods aim to increase training efficiency by reweighting samples based on their running losses. However, these methods do not solve the problems caused by heavy-tailed distribution losses, such as overfitting to outliers. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel approach: a Gaussian loss-weighted sampler that multiplies their running losses with a Gaussian distribution weight. It reduces the probability of selecting samples with very low or very high losses while favoring those close to average losses. As it creates a weighted loss distribution that is not heavy-tailed theoretically, there are several advantages to highlight compared to existing methods: 1) it relieves the inefficiency in learning redundant easy samples and overfitting to outliers, 2) It improves training efficiency by preferentially learning samples close to the average loss. Application on real-world time series forecasting datasets demonstrate improvements in prediction quality for 1%-4% using mean square error measurements in channel-independent settings.

Recently deep learning models have shown great advances in modeling the time series data but they heavily depend on a large amount of labeled data. To avoid costly labeling, this paper explores domain adaptation from a labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain on time series data. To achieve the goal, we propose a disentangled representation learning framework named CADT to disentangle the domain-invariant features from the domain-specific ones. Particularly, CADT is injected with a novel class-wise hypersphere loss to improve the generalization of the classifier from the source domain to the target domain. Intuitively, it restricts the source data of the same class within the same hypersphere and minimizes the radius of it, which in turn enlarges the margin between different classes and makes the decision boundary of both domains easier. We further devise several kinds of domain-preserving data augmentation methods to better capture the domain-specific patterns. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and two real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model against several state-of-the-art baselines.">

We derive a closed-form solution for multi-task optimization in the context of linear models. Our analysis provides valuable insights by linking the multi-task learning performance to various model statistics such as raw data covariances, signal-generating hyperplanes, noise levels, as well as the size and number of datasets. We finally propose a consistent estimation of training and testing errors, thereby offering a robust foundation for hyperparameter optimization in multi-task regression scenarios.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has been an essential field in many different application areas, including economic analysis, meteorology, and so forth. The majority of time series forecasting models are trained using the mean squared error (MSE). However, this training based on MSE causes a limitation known as prediction delay. The prediction delay, which implies the ground-truth precedes the prediction, can cause serious problems in a variety of fields, e.g., finance and weather forecasting -- as a matter of fact, predictions succeeding ground-truth observations are not practically meaningful although their MSEs can be low. This paper proposes a new perspective on traditional time series forecasting tasks and introduces a new solution to mitigate the prediction delay. We introduce a continuous-time gated recurrent unit (GRU) based on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) which can supervise explicit time-derivatives. We generalize the GRU architecture in a continuous-time manner and minimize the prediction delay through our time-derivative regularization. Our method outperforms in metrics such as MSE, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Time Distortion Index (TDI). In addition, we demonstrate the low prediction delay of our method in a variety of datasets.">

        <tr id="Generative retrieval has recently emerged as a promising approach to sequential recommendation, framing candidate item retrieval as an autoregressive sequence generation problem. However, existing generative methods typically focus solely on either behavioral or semantic aspects of item information, neglecting their complementary nature and thus resulting in limited effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce EAGER, a novel generative recommendation framework that seamlessly integrates both behavioral and semantic information. Specifically, we identify three key challenges in combining these two types of information: a unified generative architecture capable of handling two feature types, ensuring sufficient and independent learning for each type, and fostering subtle interactions that enhance collaborative information utilization. To achieve these goals, we propose (1) a two-stream generation architecture leveraging a shared encoder and two separate decoders to decode behavior tokens and semantic tokens with a confidence-based ranking strategy; (2) a global contrastive task with summary tokens to achieve discriminative decoding for each type of information; and (3) a semantic-guided transfer task designed to implicitly promote cross-interactions through reconstruction and estimation objectives. We validate the effectiveness of EAGER on four public benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.">

To overcome this limitation, we propose a two-step approach consisting of (1) generating rule functions from knowledge and (2) using these rules to define rule based layers -- a new type of dynamic neural network layer. The focus of this work is on the second step, i.e., rule based layers that are designed to dynamically arrange learnable parameters in the weight matrices and bias vectors depending on the input samples. Indeed, we prove that our approach generalizes classical feed-forward layers such as fully connected and convolutional layers by choosing appropriate rules. As a concrete application we present rule based graph neural networks (RuleGNNs) that overcome some limitations of ordinary graph neural networks. Our experiments show that the predictive performance of RuleGNNs is comparable to state-of-the-art graph classifiers using simple rules based on Weisfeiler-Leman labeling and pattern counting. Moreover, we introduce new synthetic benchmark graph datasets to show how to integrate expert knowledge into RuleGNNs making them more powerful than ordinary graph neural networks.">

        <tr id="Representation learning in sequential recommendation is critical for accurately modeling user interaction patterns and improving recommendation precision. However, existing approaches predominantly emphasize item-to-item transitions, often neglecting the time intervals between interactions, which are closely related to behavior pattern changes. Additionally, broader interaction attributes, such as item frequency, are frequently overlooked. We found that both sequences with more uniform time intervals and items with higher frequency yield better prediction performance. Conversely, non-uniform sequences exacerbate user interest drift and less-frequent items are difficult to model due to sparse sampling, presenting unique challenges inadequately addressed by current methods. In this paper, we propose UniRec, a novel bidirectional enhancement sequential recommendation method. UniRec leverages sequence uniformity and item frequency to enhance performance, particularly improving the representation of non-uniform sequences and less-frequent items. These two branches mutually reinforce each other, driving comprehensive performance optimization in complex sequential recommendation scenarios. Additionally, we present a multidimensional time module to further enhance adaptability. To the best of our knowledge, UniRec is the first method to utilize the characteristics of uniformity and frequency for feature augmentation. Comparing with eleven advanced models across four datasets, we demonstrate that UniRec outperforms SOTA models significantly. The code is available at https://github.com/Linxi000/UniRec.">

        <tr id="Self-supervised contrastive learning has become a key technique in deep learning, particularly in time series analysis, due to its ability to learn meaningful representations without explicit supervision. Augmentation is a critical component in contrastive learning, where different augmentations can dramatically impact performance, sometimes influencing accuracy by over 30%. However, the selection of augmentations is predominantly empirical which can be suboptimal, or grid searching that is time-consuming. In this paper, we establish a principled framework for selecting augmentations based on dataset characteristics such as trend and seasonality. Specifically, we construct 12 synthetic datasets incorporating trend, seasonality, and integration weights. We then evaluate the effectiveness of 8 different augmentations across these synthetic datasets, thereby inducing generalizable associations between time series characteristics and augmentation efficiency. Additionally, we evaluated the induced associations across 6 real-world datasets encompassing domains such as activity recognition, disease diagnosis, traffic monitoring, electricity usage, mechanical fault prognosis, and finance. These real-world datasets are diverse, covering a range from 1 to 12 channels, 2 to 10 classes, sequence lengths of 14 to 1280, and data frequencies from 250 Hz to daily intervals. The experimental results show that our proposed trend-seasonality-based augmentation recommendation algorithm can accurately identify the effective augmentations for a given time series dataset, achieving an average Recall@3 of 0.667, outperforming baselines. Our work provides guidance for studies employing contrastive learning in time series analysis, with wide-ranging applications.

Moreover, the decoder recurrence allows generation to be resumed without reprocessing the whole sequence. Finally, we propose the autoregressive VSSM that can be conditioned on a partial realization of the sequence, as is common in language generation tasks. Interestingly, the autoregressive VSSM still enables parallel generation.

In this paper, we challenge traditional approaches by introducing a novel benchmark, HoTPP, specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to predict event sequences over a horizon. This benchmark features a new metric inspired by object detection in computer vision, addressing the limitations of existing metrics in assessing models with imprecise time-step predictions. Our evaluations on established datasets employing various models demonstrate that high accuracy in next-event prediction does not necessarily translate to superior horizon prediction, and vice versa.

A neural network is used to model the Uncertainty Estimator as a probability distribution rather than probabilistic discrete scalar values. We train these models under the classic episodic learning paradigm in the $n$-way, $k$-shot fashion, in an end-to-end setting. Our work demonstrates that implementation of the uncertainty estimator on a GNN backbone network improves the classification accuracy under Few-shot setting without any meta-learning specific architecture. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets under different Few-shot settings and different GNN-based backbone networks. Our method outperforms the baselines, which demonstrates the efficacy of the Uncertainty Estimator for Few-shot node classification on graphs with a GNN.">

Deep neural networks, however, have often struggled with these for a variety of reasons. Recent advances, both in system engineering as well as model design, have enabled the scaling up of model that are purported to support extended context length. In particular, the state-space and linear recurrent neural network families of models hypothetically can entend to infinite sequence lenth. However, is this too good to be true? We conduct an evaluation to show that while such claims may be sound theoretically, there remain large practical gaps that are empirically observed. In particular, recurrent models still suffer in the same settings as long-context LLMs with attention. We further show that different inductive biases have inconsistent extrapolation capabilities, highlighting the need to further study such paradigms and investigate why long-context models seemingly fail to behave as one might expect.">

When such systems are deployed in critical areas like finance, the consequences of their uncertain behavior could be severe. In this paper, we focus on multi-modal time-series forecasting, where imprecision due to noisy or incorrect data can lead to erroneous predictions, impacting stakeholders such as analysts, investors, and traders. Recently, it has been shown that beyond numeric data, graphical transformations can be used with advanced visual models to achieve better performance. In this context, we introduce a rating methodology to assess the robustness of Multi-Modal Time-Series Forecasting Models (MM-TSFM) through causal analysis, which helps us understand and quantify the isolated impact of various attributes on the forecasting accuracy of MM-TSFM. We apply our novel rating method on a variety of numeric and multi-modal forecasting models in a large experimental setup (six input settings of control and perturbations, ten data distributions, time series from six leading stocks in three industries over a year of data, and five time-series forecasters) to draw insights on robust forecasting models and the context of their strengths. Within the scope of our study, our main result is that multi-modal (numeric + visual) forecasting, which was found to be more accurate than numeric forecasting in previous studies, can also be more robust in diverse settings. Our work will help different stakeholders of time-series forecasting understand the models` behaviors along trust (robustness) and accuracy dimensions to select an appropriate model for forecasting using our rating method, leading to improved decision-making.">

        <tr id="The goal of stock trend prediction is to forecast future market movements for informed investment decisions. Existing methods mostly focus on predicting stock trends with supervised models trained on extensive annotated data. However, human annotation can be resource-intensive and the annotated data are not readily available. Inspired by the impressive few-shot capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose using LLMs in a few-shot setting to overcome the scarcity of labeled data and make prediction more feasible to investors. Previous works typically merge multiple financial news for predicting stock trends, causing two significant problems when using LLMs: (1) Merged news contains noise, and (2) it may exceed LLMs' input limits, leading to performance degradation. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-step method 'denoising-then-voting'. Specifically, we introduce an `Irrelevant' category, and predict stock trends for individual news instead of merged news. Then we aggregate these predictions using majority voting. The proposed method offers two advantages: (1) Classifying noisy news as irrelevant removes its impact on the final prediction. (2) Predicting for individual news mitigates LLMs' input length limits. Our method achieves 66.59% accuracy in S&P 500, 62.17% in CSI-100, and 61.17% in HK stock prediction, outperforming the standard few-shot counterparts by around 7%, 4%, and 4%. Furthermore, our proposed method performs on par with state-of-the-art supervised methods.">

However, they still suffer from limitations of the autoregressive training paradigm. For example, autoregressive token generation is notably slow and can be prone to \textit{exposure bias}. The diffusion-based language models were proposed as an alternative to autoregressive generation to address some of these limitations. We evaluate the recently proposed Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion (SEDD) approach and show it is a promising alternative to autoregressive generation but it has some short-comings too. We empirically demonstrate the advantages and challenges of SEDD, and observe that SEDD generally matches autoregressive models in perplexity and on benchmarks such as HellaSwag, Arc or WinoGrande. Additionally, we show that in terms of inference latency, SEDD can be up to 4.5$\times$ more efficient than GPT-2. While SEDD allows conditioning on tokens at abitrary positions, SEDD appears slightly weaker than GPT-2 for conditional generation given short prompts. Finally, we reproduced the main results from the original SEDD paper.">

        <tr id="Recently, multiple models proposed for link prediction (LP) demonstrate impressive results on benchmark datasets. However, many popular benchmark datasets often assume that dataset samples are drawn from the same distribution (i.e., IID samples). In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; since uncontrolled factors may lead train and test samples to come from separate distributions. To tackle the distribution shift problem, recent work focuses on creating datasets that feature distribution shifts and designing generalization methods that perform well on the new data. However, those studies only consider distribution shifts that affect {\it node-} and {\it graph-level} tasks, thus ignoring link-level tasks. Furthermore, relatively few LP generalization methods exist. To bridge this gap, we introduce a set of LP-specific data splits which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift. We verify the shift's effect empirically through evaluation of different SOTA LP methods and subsequently couple these methods with generalization techniques. Interestingly, LP-specific methods frequently generalize poorly relative to heuristics or basic GNN methods. Finally, this work provides analysis to uncover insights for enhancing LP generalization.

It is crucial to understand it for the development of techniques focusing on attention distribution, such as Key-Value (KV) Cache compression and infinite extrapolation; however, the latent cause leaves to be unknown. In this paper, we analyze such a phenomenon from the perspective of waiver phenomenon, which involves reducing the internal values of certain elements in the sequence, allowing them to absorb excess attention without affecting their contribution to information. In specific models, due to differences in positional encoding and attention patterns, we have found that the selection of waiver elements by the model can be categorized into two methods: positional-encoding-based and feature-distribution-within-elements-based.">

        <tr id="CPU performance prediction, which involves forecasting the performance scores of a CPU based on its hardware characteristics during its operation, is a critical technology for computational system design and resource management in the big data era. However, this research field currently faces two significant challenges. First, collecting real-world data is challenging due to the wide variety of CPU products on the market and the highly specialized nature of relevant hardware characteristics. In the research process, this field lacks a standard dataset with unified hardware characteristics, wide data coverage, and comprehensive benchmarks. Second, existing methods based on hardware simulation models or machine learning exhibit notable shortcomings, such as lengthy simulation test cycles and low prediction accuracy. To bridge these gaps, we first collect, preprocess, and standardize historical data from the 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors across multiple benchmark suites to create a new dataset, named PerfCastDB. Subsequently, we design a deep learning based model called Nova CPU Performance Predictor (NCPP) as the baseline for this new dataset. The NCPP network is designed based on group attention mechanism. It effectively quantifies the implicit relationships between hardware characteristics within and across groups and comprehensively models the impact of various hardware characteristics on CPU performance prediction. We conduct comparative experiments using the proposed PerfCastDB dataset. Compared to existing approaches, NCPP achieves superior evaluation results, demonstrating its effectiveness.

To solve this problem, this paper introduces a novel network for ocean current prediction, termed ATL-Net, which integrates the self-attention mechanism, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. ATL-Net enhances feature extraction through the inflated convolutions of TCN, captures ocean current dynamics more effectively with the self-attention mechanism, and uses LSTM for its ability to memorize long sequences of current information. Experimental results on WaMoSII data demonstrate the effectiveness of ATL-Net, which achieves the current speed prediction accuracy of 92.9% and the current direction accuracy of 90.4%. The results outperform those of existing methods.

 Traffic forecasting problems involve jointly modeling the non-linear spatio-temporal dependencies at different scales. While Graph Neural Network models have been effectively used to capture the non-linear spatial dependencies, capturing the dynamic spatial dependencies between the locations remains a major challenge. The errors in capturing such dependencies propagate in modeling the temporal dependencies between the locations, thereby severely affecting the performance of long-term predictions. While transformer-based mechanisms have been recently proposed for capturing the dynamic spatial dependencies, these methods are susceptible to fluctuations in data brought on by unforeseen events like traffic congestion and accidents. To mitigate these issues we propose an improvised Spatio-temporal parallel transformer (STPT) based model for traffic prediction that uses multiple adjacency graphs passed through a pair of coupled graph transformer-convolution network units, operating in parallel, to generate more noise-resilient embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 real-world traffic datasets and compare the performance of STPT with several state-of-the-art baselines, in terms of measures like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. We find that using STPT improves the performance by around

 \(10-34\%\)

 as compared to the baselines. We also investigate the applicability of the model on other spatio-temporal data in other domains. We use a covid-19 dataset to predict the number of future occurrences in different regions from a given set of historical occurrences. The results demonstrate the superiority of our model for such datasets.

The proposed ResTCN-DAM is designed to leverage the unique attributes of these three modules: TCN has outstanding capability to process time series data in parallel. By combining with modified ResNet, multiple TCN layers can be densely stacked to capture more hidden information in the temporal dimension. DAM module adeptly captures the interdependencies within both temporal and feature dimensions, adeptly accentuating relevant time steps/features while diminishing less significant ones with minimal computational cost. Furthermore, the snapshot ensemble method is able to obtain the effect of training multiple models through one single training process, which ensures the accuracy and robustness of the forecasts. The deep integration and collaborative cooperation of these modules comprehensively enhance the model's forecasting capability from various perspectives. Ablation studies conducted validate the efficacy of each module, and through multiple sets of comparative experiments, it is shown that the proposed ResTCN-DAM has exceptional and consistent performance across varying lead times. We also employ visualization techniques to display heatmaps of the model's weights, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. When compared with the prevailing neural network-based runoff forecasting models, ResTCN-DAM exhibits state-of-the-art accuracy, temporal robustness, and interpretability, positioning it at the forefront of contemporary research.">

        <tr id="Distribution shift over time occurs in many settings. Leveraging historical data is necessary to learn a model for the last time point when limited data is available in the final period, yet few methods have been developed specifically for this purpose. In this work, we construct a benchmark with different sequences of synthetic shifts to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 classes of methods that 1) learn from all data without adapting to the final period, 2) learn from historical data with no regard to the sequential nature and then adapt to the final period, and 3) leverage the sequential nature of historical data when tailoring a model to the final period. We call this benchmark Seq-to-Final to highlight the focus on using a sequence of time periods to learn a model for the final time point. Our synthetic benchmark allows users to construct sequences with different types of shift and compare different methods. We focus on image classification tasks using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as the base images for the synthetic sequences. We also evaluate the same methods on the Portraits dataset to explore the relevance to real-world shifts over time. Finally, we create a visualization to contrast the initializations and updates from different methods at the final time step. Our results suggest that, for the sequences in our benchmark, methods that disregard the sequential structure and adapt to the final time point tend to perform well. The approaches we evaluate that leverage the sequential nature do not offer any improvement. We hope that this benchmark will inspire the development of new algorithms that are better at leveraging sequential historical data or a deeper understanding of why methods that disregard the sequential nature are able to perform well.">

        <tr id="Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) improves recommendation performance by utilizing information from multiple domains, which contrasts with Single-Domain Sequential Recommendation (SDSR) that relies on a historical interaction within a specific domain. However, CDSR may underperform compared to the SDSR approach in certain domains due to negative transfer, which occurs when there is a lack of relation between domains or different levels of data sparsity. To address the issue of negative transfer, our proposed CDSR model estimates the degree of negative transfer of each domain and adaptively assigns it as a weight factor to the prediction loss, to control gradient flows through domains with significant negative transfer. To this end, our model compares the performance of a model trained on multiple domains (CDSR) with a model trained solely on the specific domain (SDSR) to evaluate the negative transfer of each domain using our asymmetric cooperative network. In addition, to facilitate the transfer of valuable cues between the SDSR and CDSR tasks, we developed an auxiliary loss that maximizes the mutual information between the representation pairs from both tasks on a per-domain basis. This cooperative learning between SDSR and CDSR tasks is similar to the collaborative dynamics between pacers and runners in a marathon. Our model outperformed numerous previous works in extensive experiments on two real-world industrial datasets across ten service domains. We also have deployed our model in the recommendation system of our personal assistant app service, resulting in 21.4% increase in click-through rate compared to existing models, which is valuable to real-world business.">

By utilizing only a portion of IoV data instead of the entire dataset, the significant overheads associated with collecting and processing large amounts of data can be avoided. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that utilizes sparse IoV data to achieve cost-effective TSE. Particularly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal attention model called the convolutional retentive network (CRNet) to improve the TSE accuracy by mining spatial-temporal traffic state correlations. The model employs the convolutional neural network (CNN) for spatial correlation aggregation and the retentive network (RetNet) based on the attention mechanism to extract temporal correlations. Extensive simulations on a real-world IoV dataset validate the advantage of the proposed TSE approach in achieving accurate TSE using sparse IoV data, demonstrating its cost effectiveness and practicality for real-world applications.">

        <tr id="We present the history-aware transformer (HAT), a transformer-based model that uses shoppers' purchase history to personalise outfit predictions. The aim of this work is to recommend outfits that are internally coherent while matching an individual shopper's style and taste. To achieve this, we stack two transformer models, one that produces outfit representations and another one that processes the history of purchased outfits for a given shopper. We use these models to score an outfit's compatibility in the context of a shopper's preferences as inferred from their previous purchases. During training, the model learns to discriminate between purchased and random outfits using 3 losses: the focal loss for outfit compatibility typically used in the literature, a contrastive loss to bring closer learned outfit embeddings from a shopper's history, and an adaptive margin loss to facilitate learning from weak negatives. Together, these losses enable the model to make personalised recommendations based on a shopper's purchase history. Our experiments on the IQON3000 and Polyvore datasets show that HAT outperforms strong baselines on the outfit Compatibility Prediction (CP) and the Fill In The Blank (FITB) tasks. The model improves AUC for the CP hard task by 15.7% (IQON3000) and 19.4% (Polyvore) compared to previous SOTA results. It further improves accuracy on the FITB hard task by 6.5% and 9.7%, respectively. We provide ablation studies on the personalisation, constrastive loss, and adaptive margin loss that highlight the importance of these modelling choices.">

        <tr id="In response to the insufficient consideration of spatio-temporal dependencies and traffic pattern similarity in traffic flow prediction methods based on federated learning, as well as the neglect of model heterogeneity and objective heterogeneity, a traffic flow prediction model based on federated learning and spatio-temporal graph neural networks is proposed. The model is divided into two stages. In the road network division stage, the traffic road network is divided into subnetworks by the dynamic time warping algorithm and the K-means algorithm, to ensure the same subnetwork has the similar traffic flow pattern. The federated learning stage is divided into two sub-stages. In the local training phase, the spatio-temporal graph neural network with an attention mechanism is utilized to create personalized models and meme models to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of each subnetwork. At the same time, deep mutual learning is utilized to address model heterogeneity and objective heterogeneity through knowledge distillation. In the global aggregation phase, a multi-factor weighted aggregation strategy is designed to measure the contribution of each local model to the global model, to enhance the fairness of aggregation. Three sets of experiments were conducted on two real datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models in three common evaluation metrics.">

        <tr id="As the usage of user-private-data is increasingly monitored by regulatory institutions for security purposes, its transfer becomes more constrained. Synthetic data has recently emerged as a viable alternative to prevent the disclosure of user-protected information that complies with data sharing regulations. Both public and private sectors commonly use a combination of tabular and time-series tables that often contains user-related sensitive information. They are usually intrinsically interlinked as they describe the users and their behaviors over different perimeters. Moreover, it contains both numerical and categorical features, adding complexity to the anonymization task. State of the art generative methods, specialized either in tabular or time-series data, are able to generate high quality synthetic data. However, if each table is generated independently, it becomes impossible to link them. As a result, the usability of such synthetic data is impacted. To address this issue, we not only propose a coherent multi-table generative model that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to sample both tabular and time-series tables , but also a conditional time-series generative model that handles both numerical and categorical features. Additionally, many experiments are conducted to analyse the inner modules of our model and evaluate it on an in-house private dataset in order to prove the viability of the synthetic data generated for machine learning tasks.">

However, a predominant focus in the field centers on predicting the Remaining Useful Life using unprocessed or minimally processed data, frequently neglecting the intricate dynamics inherent in the dataset. In this work we introduce a novel methodology grounded in the analysis of statistical similarity within latent data from system components. Leveraging a specifically designed architecture based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder, we create a sequence of discrete vectors which is used to estimate system-specific priors. We infer the similarity between systems by evaluating the divergence of these priors, offering a nuanced understanding of individual system behaviors. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through experiments on the NASA commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset. Our validation not only underscores the potential of our method in advancing the study of latent statistical divergence but also demonstrates its superiority over existing techniques.">

        <tr id="Multivariate time series modeling has been essential in sensor-based data mining tasks. However, capturing complex dynamics caused by intra-variable (temporal) and inter-variable (spatial) relationships while simultaneously taking into account evolving data distributions is a non-trivial task, which faces accumulated computational overhead and multiple temporal patterns or distribution modes. Most existing methods focus on the former direction without adaptive task-specific learning ability. To this end, we developed a holistic spatial-temporal meta-learning probabilistic inference framework, entitled ST-MeLaPI, for the efficient and versatile learning of complex dynamics. Specifically, first, a multivariate relationship recognition module is utilized to learn task-specific inter-variable dependencies. Then, a multiview meta-learning and probabilistic inference strategy was designed to learn shared parameters while enabling the fast and flexible learning of task-specific parameters for different batches. At the core are spatial dependency-oriented and temporal pattern-oriented meta-learning approximate probabilistic inference modules, which can quickly adapt to changing environments via stochastic neurons at each timestamp. Finally, a gated aggregation scheme is leveraged to realize appropriate information selection for the generative style prediction. We benchmarked our approach against state-of-the-art methods with real-world data. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the baselines.">

        <tr id="The telecommunications industry is becoming increasingly aware of potential subscriber churn as a result of the growing popularity of smartphones in the mobile Internet era, the quick development of telecommunications services, the implementation of the number portability policy, and the intensifying competition among operators. At the same time, users' consumption preferences and choices are evolving. Excellent churn prediction models must be created in order to accurately predict the churn tendency, since keeping existing customers is far less expensive than acquiring new ones. But conventional or learning-based algorithms can only go so far into a single subscriber's data; they cannot take into consideration changes in a subscriber's subscription and ignore the coupling and correlation between various features. Additionally, the current churn prediction models have a high computational burden, a fuzzy weight distribution, and significant resource economic costs. The prediction algorithms involving network models currently in use primarily take into account the private information shared between users with text and pictures, ignoring the reference value supplied by other users with the same package. This work suggests a user churn prediction model based on Graph Attention Convolutional Neural Network (GAT-CNN) to address the aforementioned issues. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, we present a three-tiered hierarchical cloud-edge cooperative framework that increases the volume of user feature input by means of two aggregations at the device, edge, and cloud layers. Second, we extend the use of users' own data by introducing self-attention and graph convolution models to track the relative changes of both users and packages simultaneously. Lastly, we build an integrated offline-online system for churn prediction based on the strengths of the two models, and we experimentally validate the efficacy of cloud-side collaborative training and inference. In summary, the churn prediction model based on Graph Attention Convolutional Neural Network presented in this paper can effectively address the drawbacks of conventional algorithms and offer telecom operators crucial decision support in developing subscriber retention strategies and cutting operational expenses.">

        <tr id="Mixed-type time series (MTTS) is a bimodal data type that is common in many domains, such as healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and social media. It consists of regularly sampled continuous time series and irregularly sampled categorical event sequences. The integration of both modalities through multimodal fusion is a promising approach for processing MTTS. However, the question of how to effectively fuse both modalities remains open. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of several deep multimodal fusion approaches for MTTS forecasting. Our comparison includes three fusion types (early, intermediate, and late) and five fusion methods (concatenation, weighted mean, weighted mean with correlation, gating, and feature sharing). We evaluate these fusion approaches on three distinct datasets, one of which was generated using a novel framework. This framework allows for the control of key data properties, such as the strength and direction of intermodal interactions, modality imbalance, and the degree of randomness in each modality, providing a more controlled environment for testing fusion approaches. Our findings show that the performance of different fusion approaches can be substantially influenced by the direction and strength of intermodal interactions. The study reveals that early and intermediate fusion approaches excel at capturing fine-grained and coarse-grained cross-modal features, respectively. These findings underscore the crucial role of intermodal interactions in determining the most effective fusion strategy for MTTS forecasting.">

        <tr id="We present a knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) framework for modeling multi-scale processes, and study its performance in the context of streamflow forecasting in hydrology. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical recurrent neural architecture that factorizes the system dynamics at multiple temporal scales and captures their interactions. This framework consists of an inverse and a forward model. The inverse model is used to empirically resolve the system's temporal modes from data (physical model simulations, observed data, or a combination of them from the past), and these states are then used in the forward model to predict streamflow. In a hydrological system, these modes can represent different processes, evolving at different temporal scales (e.g., slow: groundwater recharge and baseflow vs. fast: surface runoff due to extreme rainfall). A key advantage of our framework is that once trained, it can incorporate new observations into the model's context (internal state) without expensive optimization approaches (e.g., EnKF) that are traditionally used in physical sciences for data assimilation. Experiments with several river catchments from the NWS NCRFC region show the efficacy of this ML-based data assimilation framework compared to standard baselines, especially for basins that have a long history of observations. Even for basins that have a shorter observation history, we present two orthogonal strategies of training our FHNN framework: (a) using simulation data from imperfect simulations and (b) using observation data from multiple basins to build a global model. We show that both of these strategies (that can be used individually or together) are highly effective in mitigating the lack of training data. The improvement in forecast accuracy is particularly noteworthy for basins where local models perform poorly because of data sparsity.">

 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep learning models specifically designed for analyzing graph-structured data, capturing complex relationships and structures to improve analysis and prediction. A common task in GNNs is node classification, where each node in the graph is assigned a predefined category. The Graph Attention Network (GAT) is a popular variant of GNNs known for its ability to capture complex dependencies by assigning importance weights to nodes during information aggregation. However, the GAT’s reliance on local attention mechanisms limits its effectiveness in capturing global information and long-range dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose a new attention mechanism called Global-Local Graph Attention (GLGA). Our mechanism enables the GAT to capture long-range dependencies and global graph structures while maintaining its ability to focus on local interactions. We evaluate our algorithm on three citation datasets (Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed) using multiple metrics, demonstrating its superiority over other baseline models. The proposed GLGA mechanism has been proven to be an effective solution for improving node classification tasks.">

However, the sparsity of real-world LTV data presents a significant challenge to LTV predictive model(i.e., pLTV), severely limiting the their capabilities. Therefore, we propose to utilize external data, in addition to the internal data of advertising platform, to expand the size of purchase samples and enhance the LTV prediction model of the advertising platform. To tackle the issue of data distribution shift between internal and external platforms, we introduce an Adaptive Difference Siamese Network (ADSNet), which employs cross-domain transfer learning to prevent negative transfer. Specifically, ADSNet is designed to learn information that is beneficial to the target domain. We introduce a gain evaluation strategy to calculate information gain, aiding the model in learning helpful information for the target domain and providing the ability to reject noisy samples, thus avoiding negative transfer. Additionally, we also design a Domain Adaptation Module as a bridge to connect different domains, reduce the distribution distance between them, and enhance the consistency of representation space distribution. We conduct extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests on a real advertising platform. Our proposed ADSNet method outperforms other methods, improving GINI by 2$\%$. The ablation study highlights the importance of the gain evaluation strategy in negative gain sample rejection and improving model performance. Additionally, ADSNet significantly improves long-tail prediction. The online A/B tests confirm ADSNet's efficacy, increasing online LTV by 3.47$\%$ and GMV by 3.89$\%$.">

        <tr id="This study introduces a novel approach that integrates dynamic Bayesian network with attention based spatio-temporal graph convolutional network to forecast railway train delays, capturing the intricate operation interactions between train events and the dynamic evolution of train delays. Initially, train delay patterns are identified using the K-means clustering algorithm and incorporated as additional variables into the prediction model. To capture dynamic causality in delay propagation, we utilize a dynamic Bayesian network-based dynamic causality graph, incorporating train delay data and domain knowledge to effectively model the train delay propagation. Leveraging these insights on delay dynamic propagation, we propose an attention based spatio-temporal graph convolutional network that effectively models the dynamic spatio-temporal dependency among train events and enhances the accuracy of delay predictions. The proposed method is assessed using operational data from the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway. Results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models, particularly with the expansion of the prediction horizon. The learned dynamic causality of the train delay propagation enhances interpretability and results in a 6.97% reduction in mean absolute error. Furthermore, train delay patterns and weather variables contribute to a respective 12.85% and 4.37% reduction in mean absolute error. The statistical tests further validate the efficacy of the proposed model.">

        <tr id="A Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) is a stochastic process whose realization is a set of event-time data. MTPP is often used to understand complex dynamics of asynchronous temporal events such as money transaction, social media, healthcare, etc. Recent studies have utilized deep neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies of events and generate embedding that aptly represent the observed events. While most previous studies focus on the inter-event dependencies and their representations, how individual events influence the overall dynamics over time has been under-explored. In this regime, we propose a Decoupled MTPP framework that disentangles characterization of a stochastic process into a set of evolving influences from different events. Our approach employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to learn flexible continuous dynamics of these influences while simultaneously addressing multiple inference problems, such as density estimation and survival rate computation. We emphasize the significance of disentangling the influences by comparing our framework with state-of-the-art methods on real-life datasets, and provide analysis on the model behavior for potential applications.">

Owing to the complexity of port systems, traditional load forecasting methods often struggle to capture the non-linearity and multifactorial interactions within the factors creating power load. To address these challenges, this study combines variational mode decomposition (VMD), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) network to develop a multi-feature-based VMD-TCN-LSTM model for the short-term forecasting of the power load of ports. VMD is first used to decompose the power load series of ports into multiple, relatively stable components to mitigate volatility. Furthermore, meteorological and temporal features are introduced into the TCN-LSTM model, which combines the temporal feature extraction capability of the TCN and the long term-dependent learning capability of the LSTM. Comparative analyses with other common forecasting models using the observed power load data from a coastal port in China demonstrate that the proposed forecasting model achieves a higher prediction accuracy, with an R-squared value of 0.94, mean squared error of 3.59 MW, and a mean absolute percentage error of 2.36%.">

Recently, deep learning-based methods have been increasingly applied in the field of weather forecasting due to their powerful feature learning capabilities. However, prediction methods based on the original space iteration struggle to effectively and efficiently utilize large number of weather variables. Therefore, we propose an 'encoding-prediction-decoding' prediction network. This network can efficiently benefit to more related input variables with key variables, that is, it can adaptively extract key variable-related low-dimensional latent feature from much more input atmospheric variables for iterative prediction. And we construct a loss function to guide the iteration of latent feature by utilizing multiple atmospheric variables in corresponding lead times. The obtained latent features through iterative prediction are then decoded to obtain the predicted values of key variables in multiple lead times. In addition, we improve the HTA algorithm in \cite{bi2023accurate} by inputting more time steps to enhance the temporal correlation between the prediction results and input variables. Both qualitative and quantitative prediction results on ERA5 dataset validate the superiority of our method over other methods. (The code will be available at https://github.com/rs-lsl/Kvp-lsi)">

Therefore, in this paper, we propose $\text{Dis-H}^2\text{GCN}$, a Disentangled Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network.

On the other hand, the entire model is constructed upon the hyperbolic geometry to narrow the gap between data distributions and representing spaces. We evaluate our proposed $\text{Dis-H}^2\text{GCN}$ on five real-world heterogeneous graph datasets across two downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic state-space model that can adapt a deployed model subjected to distribution drift. Our model learns the dynamics induced by distribution shifts on the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, we infer time-evolving class prototypes that serve as a dynamic classification head. Moreover, our approach is lightweight, modifying only the model's last linear layer. In experiments on real-world distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions, we demonstrate that our approach performs competitively with methods that require back-propagation and access to the model backbone.

Conventional models often focus solely on capturing sequential patterns within the training data, neglecting the broader context and semantic information embedded in item titles from external sources. This limits their predictive power and adaptability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in SR tasks due to their advanced understanding capabilities and strong generalization abilities. Researchers have attempted to enhance LLMs' recommendation performance by incorporating information from SR models. However, previous approaches have encountered problems such as 1) only influencing LLMs at the result level; 2) increased complexity of LLMs recommendation methods leading to reduced interpretability; 3) incomplete understanding and utilization of SR models information by LLMs. To address these problems, we proposes a novel framework, DELRec, which aims to extract knowledge from SR models and enable LLMs to easily comprehend and utilize this supplementary information for more effective sequential recommendations. DELRec consists of two main stages: 1) SR Models Pattern Distilling, focusing on extracting behavioral patterns exhibited by SR models using soft prompts through two well-designed strategies; 2) LLMs-based Sequential Recommendation, aiming to fine-tune LLMs to effectively use the distilled auxiliary information to perform SR tasks. Extensive experimental results conducted on three real datasets validate the effectiveness of the DELRec framework.">

        <tr id="The utilization of Transformer-based models prospers the growth of multi-document summarization (MDS). Given the huge impact and widespread adoption of Transformer-based models in various natural language processing tasks, investigating their performance and behaviors in the context of MDS becomes crucial for advancing the field and enhancing the quality of summary. To thoroughly examine the behaviours of Transformer-based MDS models, this paper presents five empirical studies on (1) measuring the impact of document boundary separators quantitatively; (2) exploring the effectiveness of different mainstream Transformer structures; (3) examining the sensitivity of the encoder and decoder; (4) discussing different training strategies; and (5) discovering the repetition in a summary generation. The experimental results on prevalent MDS datasets and eleven evaluation metrics show the influence of document boundary separators, the granularity of different level features and different model training strategies. The results also reveal that the decoder exhibits greater sensitivity to noises compared to the encoder. This underscores the important role played by the decoder, suggesting a potential direction for future research in MDS. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that the repetition problem in the generated summaries has correlations with the high uncertainty scores.">

        <tr id="Accurate traffic forecasting is more necessary than ever for transportation departments, especially given its significant role in traffic planning, management, and control. However, most existing methods struggle to address complex spatial correlations on road networks, nonlinear temporal dynamics, and difficult long‐term prediction. This article proposes a novel spatial temporal graph gated transformer (STGGT) to overcome these challenges. The suggested model differs from Google's transformer because it uses a hybrid architecture that integrates graph convolutional networks (GCNs), attention, and gated recurrent units (GRUs) instead of solely relying on attention. Specifically, STGGT uses GCNs to extract spatial dependencies, utilizes attention and GRUs to extract temporal dependencies, and handle long‐term prediction. Experiments indicate that STGGT outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art baseline models on two real‐world traffic datasets of 9%–40%. The proposed model offers a promising solution for accurate traffic forecasting, simultaneously addressing the challenges of complex spatial correlations, nonlinear temporal dynamics, and long‐term prediction.">

        <tr id="Tabular synthesis models remain ineffective at capturing complex dependencies, and the quality of synthetic data is still insufficient for comprehensive downstream tasks, such as prediction under distribution shifts, automated decision-making, and cross-table understanding. A major challenge is the lack of prior knowledge about underlying structures and high-order relationships in tabular data. We argue that a systematic evaluation on high-order structural information for tabular data synthesis is the first step towards solving the problem. In this paper, we introduce high-order structural causal information as natural prior knowledge and provide a benchmark framework for the evaluation of tabular synthesis models. The framework allows us to generate benchmark datasets with a flexible range of data generation processes and to train tabular synthesis models using these datasets for further evaluation. We propose multiple benchmark tasks, high-order metrics, and causal inference tasks as downstream tasks for evaluating the quality of synthetic data generated by the trained models. Our experiments demonstrate to leverage the benchmark framework for evaluating the model capability of capturing high-order structural causal information. Furthermore, our benchmarking results provide an initial assessment of state-of-the-art tabular synthesis models. They have clearly revealed significant gaps between ideal and actual performance and how baseline methods differ. Our benchmark framework is available at URL https://github.com/TURuibo/CauTabBench.">

        <tr id="Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a crucial data mining technique with a wide range of applications in areas such as IT applications. Currently, the majority of anomaly detection methods for time series data rely on unsupervised approaches due to the rarity of anomaly labels. However, in real-world scenarios, obtaining a limited number of anomaly labels is feasible and affordable. Effective usage of these labels can offer valuable insights into the temporal characteristics of anomalies and play a pivotal role in guiding anomaly detection efforts. To improve the performance of multivariate time series anomaly detection, we proposed a novel deep learning model named EDD (Encoder-Decoder-Discriminator) that leverages limited anomaly samples. The EDD model innovatively integrates a graph attention network with long short term memory (LSTM) to extract spatial and temporal features from multivariate time series data. This integrated approach enables the model to capture complex patterns and dependencies within the data. Additionally, the model skillfully maps series data into a latent space, utilizing a carefully crafted loss function to cluster normal data tightly in the latent space while dispersing abnormal data randomly. This innovative design results in distinct probability distributions for normal and abnormal data in the latent space, enabling precise identification of anomalous data. To evaluate the performance of our EDD model, we conducted extensive experimental validation across three diverse datasets. The results demonstrate the significant superiority of our model in multivariate time series anomaly detection. Specifically, the average F1-Score of our model outperformed the second-best method by 2.7% and 73.4% in both evaluation approaches, respectively, highlighting its superior detection capabilities. These findings validate the effectiveness of our proposed EDD model in leveraging limited anomaly samples for accurate and robust anomaly detection in multivariate time series data.">

RNN-based methods have shown promising potential due to their strong ability to model the interaction of time and variables. However, they are prone to gradient issues like gradient explosion and vanishing gradients. And the prediction accuracy is not high. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Fractional-order Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Network with a Frequency-domain Gated Attention mechanism (FLRNN-FGA). There are three major components: the Fractional-order Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Network (FLRNN), frequency module, and gated attention mechanism. In the FLRNN, fractional-order integration is employed to describe the dynamic systems accurately. It can capture long-term dependencies and improve prediction accuracy. Lipschitz weight matrices are applied to alleviate the gradient issues. In the frequency module, temporal data are transformed into the frequency domain by Fourier transform. Frequency domain processing can reduce the computational complexity of the model. In the gated attention mechanism, the gated structure can regulate attention information transmission to reduce the number of model parameters. Extensive experimental results on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLRNN-FGA compared with the state-of-the-art methods.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for supervised machine learning over graph-structured data, while sampling-based node representation learning is widely utilized in unsupervised learning. However, scalability remains a major challenge in both supervised and unsupervised learning for large graphs (e.g., those with over 1 billion nodes). The scalability bottleneck largely stems from the mini-batch sampling phase in GNNs and the random walk sampling phase in unsupervised methods. These processes often require storing features or embeddings in memory. In the context of distributed training, they require frequent, inefficient random access to data stored across different workers. Such repeated inter-worker communication for each mini-batch leads to high communication overhead and computational inefficiency. We propose GraphScale, a unified framework for both supervised and unsupervised learning to store and process large graph data distributedly. The key insight in our design is the separation of workers who store data and those who perform the training. This separation allows us to decouple computing and storage in graph training, thus effectively building a pipeline where data fetching and data computation can overlap asynchronously. Our experiments show that GraphScale outperforms state-of-the-art methods for distributed training of both GNNs and node embeddings. We evaluate GraphScale both on public and proprietary graph datasets and observe a reduction of at least 40% in end-to-end training times compared to popular distributed frameworks, without any loss in performance. While most existing methods don't support billion-node graphs for training node embeddings, GraphScale is currently deployed in production at TikTok enabling efficient learning over such large graphs.">

However, there are some challenges for time-series forecasting in industry, e.g., predicting few-shot caused by data shortage, and decision-confusing caused by unknown treatment policy. To cope with the problems, we propose a novel causal domain adaptation framework, Causal Domain Adaptation (CDA) forecaster to improve the performance on the interested domain with limited data (target). Firstly, we analyze the causality existing along with treatments, and thus ensure the shared causality over time. Subsequently, we propose an answer-based attention mechanism to achieve domain-invariant representation by the shared causality in both domains. Then, a novel domain-adaptation is built to model treatments and outcomes jointly training on source and target domain. The main insights are that our designed answer-based attention mechanism allows the target domain to leverage the existed causality in source time-series even with different treatments, and our forecaster can predict the counterfactual outcome of industrial time-series, meaning a guidance in production process.

Although Transformer-based methods can handle time series data, their ability to predict long-term time series is limited due to the ``anti-order"nature of the self-attention mechanism. To address this problem, we focus on frequency domain to weaken the impact of order in TSF and propose the FreqBlock, where we first obtain frequency representations through the Frequency Transform Module. Subsequently, a newly designed Frequency Cross Attention is used to obtian enhanced frequency representations between the real and imaginary parts, thus establishing a link between the attention mechanism and the inherent Kramer-Kronig relations (KKRs). Our backbone network, FreqTSF, adopts a residual structure by concatenating multiple FreqBlocks to simulate KKRs in the frequency domain and avoid degradation problems. On a theoretical level, we demonstrate that the proposed two modules can significantly reduce the time and memory complexity from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ for each FreqBlock computation. Empirical studies on four benchmark datasets show that FreqTSF achieves an overall relative MSE reduction of 15\% and an overall relative MAE reduction of 11\% compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available soon.">

A lot of research focuses on modeling users' lifelong sequences, which can be extremely long and sometimes exceed thousands of items. These models use the target item to search for the most relevant items from the historical sequence. However, training lifelong sequences in click through rate (CTR) prediction or personalized search ranking (PSR) is extremely difficult due to the insufficient learning problem of ID embedding, especially when the IDs in the lifelong sequence features do not exist in the samples of training dataset. Additionally, existing target attention mechanisms struggle to learn the multi-modal representations of items in the sequence well. The distribution of multi-modal embedding (text, image and attributes) output of user's interacted items are not properly aligned and there exist divergence across modalities.

However, these models face four major limitations: (1) while most models claim to capture high-order feature interactions, they often do so implicitly and non-interpretably through deep neural networks (DNN), which limits the trustworthiness of the model's predictions; (2) the performance of existing explicit feature interaction methods is often weaker than that of implicit DNN, undermining their necessity; (3) many models fail to adaptively filter noise while enhancing the order of feature interactions; (4) the fusion methods of most models cannot provide suitable supervision signals for their different interaction methods. To address the identified limitations, this paper proposes the next generation Deep Cross Network (DCNv3) and Shallow&Deep Cross Network (SDCNv3). These models ensure interpretability in feature interaction modeling while exponentially increasing the order of feature interactions to achieve genuine Deep Crossing rather than just Deep&Cross. Additionally, we employ a Self-Mask operation to filter noise and reduce the number of parameters in the cross network by half. In the fusion layer, we use a simple yet effective loss weight calculation method called Tri-BCE to provide appropriate supervision signals. Comprehensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability of DCNv3 and SDCNv3.

However, the GCN-based methods have some limitations when applied to cross-domain fault diagnostics. First, the graph topology constructed according to certain criteria remains fixed while it may contain domain-specific information, which could hamper the extraction of domain-invariant features. Second, the non-Euclidean structure of the graph hinders its augmentation through mixing and interpolation, bringing its application challenges in scenarios with small samples. To address these limitations, this article proposes an adaptive topology-aware siamese network (ATA-SN) for cross-domain fault diagnosis with small samples. Specifically, the multichannel data are constructed as a complete graph as input. The adaptive topology-aware module updates and augments the graph simultaneously through biased uncertainty edge perturbation in a nonparametric manner. In combination with a contrastive loss, augmented data with clear class boundaries can be obtained. A statistical metrics-based style loss is used for domain-invariant feature learning. A pair of updated graphs is then fed into the siamese framework, which utilizes the semantic consistency of the paired graphs to recalibrate the contribution of the augmented data to the gradient descent, thus ensuring the effectiveness of the graph augmentation and domain adaptation. Comparative studies and cross-domain fault diagnosis experiments indicate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method even in scenarios with extremely limited training data.

Traditional approaches primarily analyze specific structural features of the network; however, node influence is typically the result of a combination of multiple factors.

To address these challenges, this paper presents an active learning model based on GraphSAGE and Transformer, named GNNTAL. This model is initially pre-trained on random or synthetic networks and subsequently fine-tuned on real-world networks by selecting a few representative nodes using K-Means clustering and uncertainty sampling. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it significantly reduces training costs; (2) it simultaneously incorporates both local and global features. A series of comparative experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks demonstrate that GNNTAL achieves superior performance. Additionally, this paper proposes an influence maximization method based on the predictions of the GNNTAL model, which achieves optimal performance without the need for complex computations. Finally, the paper analyses certain limitations of the GNNTAL model and suggests potential solutions.">

        <tr id="Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for multimedia applications. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test distributions within batches. This work provides a new perspective on analyzing batch normalization techniques through class-related and class-irrelevant features, our observations reveal combining source and test batch normalization statistics robustly characterizes target distributions. However, test statistics must have high similarity. We thus propose Discover Your Neighbours (DYN), the first backward-free approach specialized for dynamic TTA. The core innovation is identifying similar samples via instance normalization statistics and clustering into groups which provides consistent class-irrelevant representations. Specifically, Our DYN consists of layer-wise instance statistics clustering (LISC) and cluster-aware batch normalization (CABN). In LISC, we perform layer-wise clustering of approximate feature samples at each BN layer by calculating the cosine similarity of instance normalization statistics across the batch. CABN then aggregates SBN and TCN statistics to collaboratively characterize the target distribution, enabling more robust representations. Experimental results validate DYN's robustness and effectiveness, demonstrating maintained performance under dynamic data stream patterns.">

We introduce a new method to learn low-dimensional representations of nonlinear time series without supervision and can have provable recovery guarantees. The learned representation can be used for downstream machine-learning tasks such as clustering and classification. The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality. We show the competitive performance of our method on real-world time-series data with the baselines and demonstrate its effectiveness for symbolic text modeling and RNA sequence clustering.">

        <tr id="Graphs serve as generic tools to encode the underlying relational structure of data. Often this graph is not given, and so the task of inferring it from nodal observations becomes important. Traditional approaches formulate a convex inverse problem with a smoothness promoting objective and rely on iterative methods to obtain a solution. In supervised settings where graph labels are available, one can unroll and truncate these iterations into a deep network that is trained end-to-end. Such a network is parameter efficient and inherits inductive bias from the optimization formulation, an appealing aspect for data constrained settings in, e.g., medicine, finance, and the natural sciences. But typically such settings care equally about uncertainty over edge predictions, not just point estimates. Here we introduce novel iterations with independently interpretable parameters, i.e., parameters whose values - independent of other parameters' settings - proportionally influence characteristics of the estimated graph, such as edge sparsity. After unrolling these iterations, prior knowledge over such graph characteristics shape prior distributions over these independently interpretable network parameters to yield a Bayesian neural network (BNN) capable of graph structure learning (GSL) from smooth signal observations. Fast execution and parameter efficiency allow for high-fidelity posterior approximation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and thus uncertainty quantification on edge predictions. Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate this model's ability to provide well-calibrated estimates of uncertainty, in test cases that include unveiling economic sector modular structure from S$\&$P$500$ data and recovering pairwise digit similarities from MNIST images. Overall, this framework enables GSL in modest-scale applications where uncertainty on the data structure is paramount.">

        <tr id="Time series analysis is pivotal for business and financial decision making, especially with the increasing integration of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, leveraging time series data for forecasting requires extensive preprocessing to address challenges such as missing values, heteroscedasticity, seasonality, outliers, and noise. Different approaches are necessary for univariate and multivariate time series, Gaussian and non-Gaussian time series, and stationary versus non-stationary time series. Handling missing data alone is complex, demanding unique solutions for each type. Extracting statistical features, identifying data quality issues, and selecting appropriate cleaning and forecasting techniques require significant effort, time, and expertise. To streamline this process, we propose an automated strategy called Preptimize, which integrates statistical and machine learning techniques and recommends prediction model blueprints, suggesting the most suitable approaches for a given dataset as an initial step towards further analysis. Preptimize reads a sample from a large dataset and recommends the blueprint model based on optimization, making it easy to use even for non-experts. The results of various experiments indicated that Preptimize either outperformed or had comparable performance to benchmark models across multiple sectors, including stock prices, cryptocurrency, and power consumption prediction. This demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness in recommending suitable prediction models for various time series datasets, highlighting its broad applicability across different domains in time series forecasting.">

Existing methods on test-time training suffer from several limitations: (1) Mismatch between the feature extractor and classifier; (2) Interference between the main and self-supervised tasks; (3) Lack of the ability to quickly adapt to the current distribution. In light of these challenges, we propose a cascading paradigm that simultaneously updates the feature extractor and classifier at test time, mitigating the mismatch between them and enabling long-term model adaptation. The pre-training of our model is structured within a meta-learning framework, thereby minimizing the interference between the main and self-supervised tasks and encouraging fast adaptation in the presence of limited unlabelled data. Additionally, we introduce innovative evaluation metrics, average accuracy and forward transfer, to effectively measure the model's adaptation capabilities in dynamic, real-world scenarios.

In terminal airspaces, predictive models of future movements and traffic flows can help with proactive planning and efficient coordination; however, varying airport topologies, and interactions with other agents, among other factors, make accurate predictions challenging. Data-driven predictive models have shown promise for handling numerous variables to enable various downstream tasks, including collision risk assessment, taxi-out time prediction, departure metering, and emission estimations. While data-driven methods have shown improvements in these tasks, prior works lack large-scale curated surface movement datasets within the public domain and the development of generalizable trajectory forecasting models. In response to this, we propose two contributions: (1) Amelia-48, a large surface movement dataset collected using the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Surface Movement Event Service (SMES). With data collection beginning in Dec 2022, the dataset provides more than a year's worth of SMES data (~30TB) and covers 48 airports within the US National Airspace System. In addition to releasing this data in the public domain, we also provide post-processing scripts and associated airport maps to enable research in the forecasting domain and beyond. (2) Amelia-TF model, a transformer-based next-token-prediction large multi-agent multi-airport trajectory forecasting model trained on 292 days or 9.4 billion tokens of position data encompassing 10 different airports with varying topology. The open-sourced model is validated on unseen airports with experiments showcasing the different prediction horizon lengths, ego-agent selection strategies, and training recipes to demonstrate the generalization capabilities.">

        <tr id="Financial market simulation (FMS) serves as a promising tool for understanding market anomalies and the underlying trading behaviors. To ensure high-fidelity simulations, it is crucial to calibrate the FMS model for generating data closely resembling the observed market data. Previous efforts primarily focused on calibrating the mid-price data, leading to essential information loss of the market activities and thus biasing the calibrated model. The Limit Order Book (LOB) data is the fundamental data fully capturing the market micro-structure and is adopted by worldwide exchanges. However, LOB is not applicable to existing calibration objective functions due to its tabular structure not suitable for the vectorized input requirement. This paper proposes to explicitly learn the vectorized representations of LOB with a Transformer-based autoencoder. Then the latent vector, which captures the major information of LOB, can be applied for calibration. Extensive experiments show that the learned latent representation not only preserves the non-linear auto-correlation in the temporal axis, but the precedence between successive price levels of LOB. Besides, it is verified that the performance of the representation learning stage is consistent with the downstream calibration tasks. Thus, this work also progresses the FMS on LOB data, for the first time.">

We develop a neural network mechanism that provides a fast and accurate predictor of these distributions for moderate horizon lengths and practical settings. It is based on using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture based on the first several moments of the time-dependant inter-arrival and the stationary service time distributions; we call it the Moment-Based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method (MBRNN ). Our empirical study suggests MBRNN requires only the first four inter-arrival and service time moments. We use simulation to generate a substantial training dataset and present a thorough performance evaluation to examine the accuracy of our method using two different test sets. We show that even under the configuration with the worst performance errors, the mean number of customers over the entire timeline has an error of less than 3%. While simulation modeling can achieve high accuracy, the advantage of the MBRNN over simulation is runtime, while the MBRNN analyzes hundreds of systems within a fraction of a second. This paper focuses on a G(t)/GI/1; however, the MBRNN approach demonstrated here can be extended to other queueing systems, as the training data labeling is based on simulations (which can be applied to more complex systems) and the training is based on deep learning, which can capture very complex time sequence tasks. In summary, the MBRNN can potentially revolutionize our ability to perform transient analyses of queueing systems.">

Besides, several OCL algorithms for graphs have been proposed since graph representation learning has succeeded in various fields. These methods may use a two-step strategy, initially representing the graph and, in a second step, classifying its nodes. On the other hand, end-to-end methods learn the node representations while classifying the nodes in one learning process. We highlight three main gaps in the literature on OCL for graphs: (i) non-customized representations for OCL; (ii) the lack of constraints on hypersphere parameters learning; and (iii) the methods' lack of interpretability and visualization. We propose One-cLass Graph Autoencoder (OLGA). OLGA is end-to-end and learns the representations for the graph nodes while encapsulating the interest instances by combining two loss functions. We propose a new hypersphere loss function to encapsulate the interest instances. OLGA combines this new hypersphere loss with the graph autoencoder reconstruction loss to improve model learning. OLGA achieved state-of-the-art results and outperformed six other methods with a statistically significant difference from five methods. Moreover, OLGA learns low-dimensional representations maintaining the classification performance with an interpretable model representation learning and results.">

To address this, we propose a Time-Series Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA) and a semantic actor trained through self-supervised learning. This approach harnesses TS-JEPA's semantic representation power and predictive capabilities by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in the source data. We leverage this to optimize uplink channel utilization, while the semantic actor calculates control commands directly from the encoded representations, rather than from the original data. We test our model through multiple parallel instances of the well-known inverted cart-pole scenario, where the approach is validated through the maximization of stability under constrained uplink channel capacity.">

These processes find wide application in the natural sciences and machine learning, but their inference is known to be far from trivial. In this work we introduce a methodology for zero-shot inference of Markov jump processes (MJPs), on bounded state spaces, from noisy and sparse observations, which consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over families of MJPs, as well as over possible observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we simulate a synthetic dataset of hidden MJPs and their noisy observation process. Second, a neural network model that processes subsets of the simulated observations, and that is trained to output the initial condition and rate matrix of the target MJP in a supervised way. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) model can infer, in a zero-shot fashion, hidden MJPs evolving in state spaces of different dimensionalities. Specifically, we infer MJPs which describe (i) discrete flashing ratchet systems, which are a type of Brownian motors, and the conformational dynamics in (ii) molecular simulations, (iii) experimental ion channel data and (iv) simple protein folding models. What is more, we show that our model performs on par with state-of-the-art models which are finetuned to the target datasets.">

However, current approaches often suffer from limitations like high sensitivity to data quality and lack of interpretability. In this study, we propose GenFollower, a novel zero-shot prompting approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges. We reframe car-following behavior as a language modeling problem and integrate heterogeneous inputs into structured prompts for LLMs. This approach achieves improved prediction performance and interpretability compared to traditional baseline models. Experiments on the Waymo Open datasets demonstrate GenFollower's superior performance and ability to provide interpretable insights into factors influencing car-following behavior.

        <tr id="Recent works have shown that transformers can solve contextual reasoning tasks by internally executing computational graphs called circuits. Circuits often use attention to logically match information from subspaces of the representation, e.g. using position-in-sequence to identify the previous token. In this work, we consider a semantic subspace to be any independent subspace of the latent representation that can fully determine an attention distribution. We show that Pre-Norm, the placement of normalisation layer used by state-of-the-art transformers, violates this ability unless the model learns a strict representation structure of orthogonal spheres. This is because it causes linear subspaces to interfere through their common normalisation factor. Theoretically, we analyse circuit stability by modelling this interference as random noise on the $L_2$-norms of the query/key/value vectors, predicting a phenomenon of circuit collapse when sparse-attention shifts to a different token. Empirically, we investigate the sensitivity of real-world models trained for mathematical addition, observing a 1% rate of circuit collapse when the norms are artificially perturbed by $\lesssim$10%. We contrast Pre-Norm with QKV-Norm, which places normalisation after the attention head's linear operators. Theoretically this relaxes the representational constraints. Empirically we observe comparable in-distribution but worse out-of-distribution performance.">

In this study, we tackle this problem by applying the Quantum-Train (QT) technique to a forecasting Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model trained by Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with significant parameter reduction. The QT technique, originally successful in the A Matter of Taste challenge at QHack 2024, leverages QML to reduce the number of trainable parameters to a polylogarithmic function of the number of parameters in a classical neural network (NN). This innovative framework maps classical NN weights to a Hilbert space, altering quantum state probability distributions to adjust NN parameters. Our approach directly processes classical data without the need for quantum embedding and operates independently of quantum computing resources post-training, making it highly practical and accessible for real-world flood prediction applications. This model aims to improve the efficiency of flood forecasts, ultimately contributing to better disaster preparedness and response.">

This framework involves three main steps: transforming input variables into textual form; building of demonstrations similar to the object, and applying these to a well-trained LLM.

This paper introduces a novel deep time series clustering approach integrating VAE with metric learning. It leverages a VAE based on Gated Recurrent Units for temporal feature extraction, incorporates metric learning for joint optimization of latent space representation, and employs the sum of log likelihoods as the clustering merging criterion, markedly improving clustering accuracy and interpretability. Experimental findings demonstrate a 27.16% improvement in average clustering accuracy and a 47.15% increase in speed on industrial load data. This study offers novel insights and tools for the thorough analysis and application of time series data, with further exploration of VAE’s potential in time series clustering anticipated in future research.">

This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFM training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets that consist of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as the total energy and atomic forces. Using over 150 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) was performed on over 64,000 GPUs on Frontier to select GFM architectures with high accuracy. Early stopping was applied on each GFM architecture for energy awareness in performing such an extreme-scale task. The training of an ensemble of highest-ranked GFM architectures continued until convergence to establish uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities with ensemble learning. Our contribution opens the door for rapidly developing, training, and deploying GFMs using large-scale computational resources to enable AI-accelerated materials discovery and design.">

        <tr id="The significance of modeling long-term user interests for CTR prediction tasks in large-scale recommendation systems is progressively gaining attention among researchers and practitioners. Existing work, such as SIM and TWIN, typically employs a two-stage approach to model long-term user behavior sequences for efficiency concerns. The first stage rapidly retrieves a subset of sequences related to the target item from a long sequence using a search-based mechanism namely the General Search Unit (GSU), while the second stage calculates the interest scores using the Exact Search Unit (ESU) on the retrieved results. Given the extensive length of user behavior sequences spanning the entire life cycle, potentially reaching up to 10^6 in scale, there is currently no effective solution for fully modeling such expansive user interests. To overcome this issue, we introduced TWIN-V2, an enhancement of TWIN, where a divide-and-conquer approach is applied to compress life-cycle behaviors and uncover more accurate and diverse user interests. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering method groups items with similar characteristics in life-cycle behaviors into a single cluster during the offline phase. By limiting the size of clusters, we can compress behavior sequences well beyond the magnitude of 10^5 to a length manageable for online inference in GSU retrieval. Cluster-aware target attention extracts comprehensive and multi-faceted long-term interests of users, thereby making the final recommendation results more accurate and diverse. Extensive offline experiments on a multi-billion-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests have demonstrated the effectiveness of TWIN-V2. Under an efficient deployment framework, TWIN-V2 has been successfully deployed to the primary traffic that serves hundreds of millions of daily active users at Kuaishou.">

        <tr id="The dynamic characteristics of multiphase industrial processes present significant challenges in the field of industrial big data modeling. Traditional soft sensing models frequently neglect the process dynamics and have difficulty in capturing transient phenomena like phase transitions. To address this issue, this article introduces a causality-driven sequence segmentation (CDSS) model. This model first identifies the local dynamic properties of the causal relationships between variables, which are also referred to as causal mechanisms. It then segments the sequence into different phases based on the sudden shifts in causal mechanisms that occur during phase transitions. Additionally, a novel metric, similarity distance, is designed to evaluate the temporal consistency of causal mechanisms, which includes both causal similarity distance and stable similarity distance. The discovered causal relationships in each phase are represented as a temporal causal graph (TCG). Furthermore, a soft sensing model called temporal-causal graph convolutional network (TC-GCN) is trained for each phase, by using the time-extended data and the adjacency matrix of TCG. The numerical examples are utilized to validate the proposed CDSS model, and the segmentation results demonstrate that CDSS has excellent performance on segmenting both stable and unstable multiphase series. Especially, it has higher accuracy in separating non-stationary time series compared to other methods. The effectiveness of the proposed CDSS model and the TC-GCN model is also verified through a penicillin fermentation process. Experimental results indicate that the breakpoints discovered by CDSS align well with the reaction mechanisms and TC-GCN significantly has excellent predictive accuracy.">

 One of the core assumptions of most deep-learning-based data-driven models is that samples are independent. However, this assumption poses a key challenge in production forecasting—performance is influenced by well interference and reservoir connectivity. Most shale gas wells are hydraulically fractured and exist in complex fracture systems, and the neighboring well characteristics should also be considered when constructing data-driven forecast models. Researchers have explored using the graph convolutional network (GCN) to address this issue by incorporating neighboring well characteristics into production forecasting models. However, applying GCN to field-scale studies is problematic, as it requires training on a full batch, leading to gigantic cache allocation. In addition, the transductive nature of GCN poses challenges for direct generalization to unseen nodes. To overcome these limitations, we adopt the graph sampling and aggregation (GraphSAGE) network architecture, which allows training large graphs with batches and generalizing predictions for previously unseen nodes. By utilizing the gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, the proposed spatial-temporal (ST)-GraphSAGE model can capture cross-time relationships between the target and the neighboring wells and generate promising prediction time series for the target wells, even if they are newly drilled wells.
 The proposed approach is validated and tested using the field data from 2,240 Montney shale gas wells, including formation properties, hydraulic fracture parameters, production history, and operational data. The algorithm aggregates the first-hop information to the target node for each timestep. The encoder-decoder (ED) architecture is used to generate forecasts for the subsequent 3-year production rate by using the 1-year production history of the wells. The trained model enables the evaluation of production predictions for newly developed wells at any location. We evaluate the model’s performance using P10, P50, and P90 of the test data set’s root mean square error (RMSE). Our method preserves the topological characteristics of wells and generalizes the prediction to unseen nodes while significantly reducing training complexity, making it applicable to larger data sets. By incorporating information from adjacent wells and integrating ST data, our ST-GraphSAGE model outperforms the traditional GRU-ED model and shows enhanced interpretability.">

In this paper, we propose a Long- and Short-term Interest Denoising Network (LSIDN), which employs different encoders and tailored denoising strategies to extract long- and short-term interests, respectively, achieving both comprehensive and robust user modeling. Specifically, we employ a session-level interest extraction and evolution strategy to avoid introducing inter-session behavioral noise into long-term interest modeling; we also adopt contrastive learning equipped with a homogeneous exchanging augmentation to alleviate the impact of unintentional behavioral noise on short-term interest modeling. Results of experiments on two public datasets show that LSIDN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models and achieves significant robustness.">

To develop eXplainable AI (XAI) in these domains therefore implies explaining salient information in the time series. Current methods for obtaining saliency maps assumes localized information in the raw input space. In this paper, we argue that the salient information of a number of time series is more likely to be localized in the frequency domain. We propose FreqRISE, which uses masking based methods to produce explanations in the frequency and time-frequency domain, which shows the best performance across a number of tasks.">

        <tr id="In the rapidly evolving Next-Generation Networking (NGN) era, the adoption of zero-trust architectures has become increasingly crucial to protect security. However, provisioning zero-trust services in NGNs poses significant challenges, primarily due to the environmental complexity and dynamics. Motivated by these challenges, this paper explores efficient zero-trust service provisioning using hierarchical micro-segmentations. Specifically, we model zero-trust networks via hierarchical graphs, thereby jointly considering the resource- and trust-level features to optimize service efficiency. We organize such zero-trust networks through micro-segmentations, which support granular zero-trust policies efficiently. To generate the optimal micro-segmentation, we present the Large Language Model-Enhanced Graph Diffusion (LEGD) algorithm, which leverages the diffusion process to realize a high-quality generation paradigm. Additionally, we utilize policy boosting and Large Language Models (LLM) to enable LEGD to optimize the generation policy and understand complicated graphical features. Moreover, realizing the unique trustworthiness updates or service upgrades in zero-trust NGN, we further present LEGD-Adaptive Maintenance (LEGD-AM), providing an adaptive way to perform task-oriented fine-tuning on LEGD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LEGD achieves 90% higher efficiency in provisioning services compared with other baselines. Moreover, the LEGD-AM can reduce the service outage time by over 50%.">

        <tr id="Macroeconomic data are crucial for monitoring countries' performance and driving policy. However, traditional data acquisition processes are slow, subject to delays, and performed at a low frequency. We address this 'ragged-edge' problem with a two-step framework. The first step is a supervised learning model predicting observed low-frequency figures. We propose a neural-network-based nowcasting model that exploits mixed-frequency, high-dimensional data. The second step uses the elasticities derived from the previous step to interpolate unobserved high-frequency figures. We apply our method to nowcast countries' yearly research and development (R&D) expenditure series. These series are collected through infrequent surveys, making them ideal candidates for this task. We exploit a range of predictors, chiefly Internet search volume data, and document the relevance of these data in improving out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we leverage the high frequency of our data to derive monthly estimates of R&D expenditures, which are currently unobserved. We compare our results with those obtained from the classical regression-based and the sparse temporal disaggregation methods. Finally, we validate our results by reporting a strong correlation with monthly R&D employment data.">

The primary objective is to estimate inferencing time based on crucial factors, including bandwidth, compute device type, and the number of compute nodes, allowing for dynamic task placement and optimization in a DDI environment. Our model employs an online learning framework, continuously updating itself as new data streams in, enabling it to swiftly adapt to changing conditions and consistently deliver accurate inferencing time predictions.

        <tr id="The increasing rate of road accidents worldwide results not only in significant loss of life but also imposes billions financial burdens on societies. Current research in traffic crash frequency modeling and analysis has predominantly approached the problem as classification tasks, focusing mainly on learning-based classification or ensemble learning methods. These approaches often overlook the intricate relationships among the complex infrastructure, environmental, human and contextual factors related to traffic crashes and risky situations. In contrast, we initially propose a large-scale traffic crash language dataset, named CrashEvent, summarizing 19,340 real-world crash reports and incorporating infrastructure data, environmental and traffic textual and visual information in Washington State. Leveraging this rich dataset, we further formulate the crash event feature learning as a novel text reasoning problem and further fine-tune various large language models (LLMs) to predict detailed accident outcomes, such as crash types, severity and number of injuries, based on contextual and environmental factors. The proposed model, CrashLLM, distinguishes itself from existing solutions by leveraging the inherent text reasoning capabilities of LLMs to parse and learn from complex, unstructured data, thereby enabling a more nuanced analysis of contributing factors. Our experiments results shows that our LLM-based approach not only predicts the severity of accidents but also classifies different types of accidents and predicts injury outcomes, all with averaged F1 score boosted from 34.9% to 53.8%. Furthermore, CrashLLM can provide valuable insights for numerous open-world what-if situational-awareness traffic safety analyses with learned reasoning features, which existing models cannot offer. We make our benchmark, datasets, and model public available for further exploration.">

        <tr id="The Transformer model has shown leading performance in time series forecasting. Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

        <tr id="Long-term time series forecasting is a long-standing challenge in various applications. A central issue in time series forecasting is that methods should expressively capture long-term dependency. Furthermore, time series forecasting methods should be flexible when applied to different scenarios. Although Fourier analysis offers an alternative to effectively capture reusable and periodic patterns to achieve long-term forecasting in different scenarios, existing methods often assume high-frequency components represent noise and should be discarded in time series forecasting. However, we conduct a series of motivation experiments and discover that the role of certain frequencies varies depending on the scenarios. In some scenarios, removing high-frequency components from the original time series can improve the forecasting performance, while in others scenarios, removing them is harmful to forecasting performance. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the frequencies differently according to specific scenarios. To achieve this, we first reformulate the time series forecasting problem as learning a transfer function of each frequency in the Fourier domain. Further, we design Frequency Dynamic Fusion (FreDF), which individually predicts each Fourier component, and dynamically fuses the output of different frequencies. Moreover, we provide a novel insight into the generalization ability of time series forecasting and propose the generalization bound of time series forecasting. Then we prove FreDF has a lower bound, indicating that FreDF has better generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FreDF.">
