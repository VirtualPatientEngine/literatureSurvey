        <tr id="We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.">

        <tr id="Continuous deep learning architectures have recently re-emerged as variants of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). The infinite-depth approach offered by these models theoretically bridges the gap between deep learning and dynamical systems; however, deciphering their inner working is still an open challenge and most of their applications are currently limited to the inclusion as generic black-box modules. In this work, we "open the box" and offer a system-theoretic perspective, including state augmentation strategies and robustness, with the aim of clarifying the influence of several design choices on the underlying dynamics. We also introduce novel architectures: among them, a Galerkin-inspired depth-varying parameter model and neural ODEs with data-controlled vector fields.">

        <tr id="We introduce the framework of continuous--depth graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph neural ordinary differential equations (GDEs) are formalized as the counterpart to GNNs where the input-output relationship is determined by a continuum of GNN layers, blending discrete topological structures and differential equations. The proposed framework is shown to be compatible with various static and autoregressive GNN models. Results prove general effectiveness of GDEs: in static settings they offer computational advantages by incorporating numerical methods in their forward pass; in dynamic settings, on the other hand, they are shown to improve performance by exploiting the geometry of the underlying dynamics.">

        <tr id="We present Graph Neural Diffusion (GRAND) that approaches deep learning on graphs as a continuous diffusion process and treats Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as discretisations of an underlying PDE. In our model, the layer structure and topology correspond to the discretisation choices of temporal and spatial operators. Our approach allows a principled development of a broad new class of GNNs that are able to address the common plights of graph learning models such as depth, oversmoothing, and bottlenecks. Key to the success of our models are stability with respect to perturbations in the data and this is addressed for both implicit and explicit discretisation schemes. We develop linear and nonlinear versions of GRAND, which achieve competitive results on many standard graph benchmarks.">

        <tr id="The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is difficult, having led to a century of research so far. Recently, there have been pushes to build neural--numerical hybrid solvers, which piggy-backs the modern trend towards fully end-to-end learned systems. Most works so far can only generalize over a subset of properties to which a generic solver would be faced, including: resolution, topology, geometry, boundary conditions, domain discretization regularity, dimensionality, etc. In this work, we build a solver, satisfying these properties, where all the components are based on neural message passing, replacing all heuristically designed components in the computation graph with backprop-optimized neural function approximators. We show that neural message passing solvers representationally contain some classical methods, such as finite differences, finite volumes, and WENO schemes. In order to encourage stability in training autoregressive models, we put forward a method that is based on the principle of zero-stability, posing stability as a domain adaptation problem. We validate our method on various fluid-like flow problems, demonstrating fast, stable, and accurate performance across different domain topologies, equation parameters, discretizations, etc., in 1D and 2D.">

        <tr id="We propose Graph-Coupled Oscillator Networks (GraphCON), a novel framework for deep learning on graphs. It is based on discretizations of a second-order system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which model a network of nonlinear controlled and damped oscillators, coupled via the adjacency structure of the underlying graph. The flexibility of our framework permits any basic GNN layer (e.g. convolutional or attentional) as the coupling function, from which a multi-layer deep neural network is built up via the dynamics of the proposed ODEs. We relate the oversmoothing problem, commonly encountered in GNNs, to the stability of steady states of the underlying ODE and show that zero-Dirichlet energy steady states are not stable for our proposed ODEs. This demonstrates that the proposed framework mitigates the oversmoothing problem. Moreover, we prove that GraphCON mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem to facilitate training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Finally, we show that our approach offers competitive performance with respect to the state-of-the-art on a variety of graph-based learning tasks.">

        <tr id="Effective data-driven PDE forecasting methods often rely on fixed spatial and / or temporal discretizations. This raises limitations in real-world applications like weather prediction where flexible extrapolation at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations is required. We address this problem by introducing a new data-driven approach, DINo, that models a PDE's flow with continuous-time dynamics of spatially continuous functions. This is achieved by embedding spatial observations independently of their discretization via Implicit Neural Representations in a small latent space temporally driven by a learned ODE. This separate and flexible treatment of time and space makes DINo the first data-driven model to combine the following advantages. It extrapolates at arbitrary spatial and temporal locations; it can learn from sparse irregular grids or manifolds; at test time, it generalizes to new grids or resolutions. DINo outperforms alternative neural PDE forecasters in a variety of challenging generalization scenarios on representative PDE systems.">

        <tr id="While Hyperbolic Graph Neural Network (HGNN) has recently emerged as a powerful tool dealing with hierarchical graph data, the limitations of scalability and efficiency hinder itself from generalizing to deep models. In this paper, by envisioning depth as a continuous-time embedding evolution, we decouple the HGNN and reframe the information propagation as a partial differential equation, letting node-wise attention undertake the role of diffusivity within the Hyperbolic Neural PDE (HPDE). By introducing theoretical principles \textit{e.g.,} field and flow, gradient, divergence, and diffusivity on a non-Euclidean manifold for HPDE integration, we discuss both implicit and explicit discretization schemes to formulate numerical HPDE solvers. Further, we propose the Hyperbolic Graph Diffusion Equation (HGDE) -- a flexible vector flow function that can be integrated to obtain expressive hyperbolic node embeddings. By analyzing potential energy decay of embeddings, we demonstrate that HGDE is capable of modeling both low- and high-order proximity with the benefit of local-global diffusivity functions. Experiments on node classification and link prediction and image-text classification tasks verify the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently outperforms various competitive models by a significant margin.">

        <tr id="The optimization of the latents and parameters of diffusion models with respect to some differentiable metric defined on the output of the model is a challenging and complex problem. The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the probability flow ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function or related quantity, allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, na\"ive backpropagation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel method based on the stochastic adjoint sensitivity method to calculate the gradientwith respect to the initial noise, conditional information, and model parameters by solving an additional SDE whose solution is the gradient of the diffusion SDE. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the adjoint diffusion SDE and use a change-of-variables to simplify the solution to an exponentially weighted integral. Using this formulation we derive a custom solver for the adjoint SDE as well as the simpler adjoint ODE. The proposed adjoint diffusion solvers can efficiently compute the gradients for both the probability flow ODE and diffusion SDE for latents and parameters of the model. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adjoint diffusion solvers onthe face morphing problem.">

This calls for principled approaches that control and regulate the degree of propagation and dissipation of information throughout the neural flow.

We reconcile under a single theoretical and practical framework both non-dissipative long-range propagation and non-conservative behaviors, introducing tools from mechanical systems to gauge the equilibrium between the two components. Our approach can be applied to general message-passing architectures, and it provides theoretical guarantees on information conservation in time.

Our approach is to use general reduced-order models, like deep neural networks, to parameterize the push-forward maps such that they can push a simple reference density to the one solving the given WGF. The new dynamical system is called parameterized WGF (PWGF), and it is defined on the finite-dimensional parameter space equipped with a pullback Wasserstein metric. Our numerical scheme can approximate the solutions of WGFs for general energy functionals effectively, without requiring spatial discretization or nonconvex optimization procedures, thus avoiding some limitations of classical numerical methods and more recent deep-learning-based approaches. A comprehensive analysis of the approximation errors measured by Wasserstein distance is also provided in this work. Numerical experiments show promising computational efficiency and verified accuracy on various WGF examples using our approach.">

        <tr id="Neural Ordinary Differential Equations typically struggle to generalize to new dynamical behaviors created by parameter changes in the underlying system, even when the dynamics are close to previously seen behaviors. The issue gets worse when the changing parameters are unobserved, i.e., their value or influence is not directly measurable when collecting data. We introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a framework that encodes said unobserved parameters in a latent context vector as input to a vector field. NCFs leverage differentiability of the vector field with respect to the parameters, along with first-order Taylor expansion to allow any context vector to influence trajectories from other parameters. We validate our method and compare it to established Multi-Task and Meta-Learning alternatives, showing competitive performance in mean squared error for in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluation on the Lotka-Volterra, Glycolytic Oscillator, and Gray-Scott problems.

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

Moreover, there are legitimate concerns regarding the generalization and reliability of such approaches, as they often overlook inherent physical constraints. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel machine-learning architecture that is highly generalizable and adheres to conservation laws and physical symmetries, thereby ensuring greater reliability. The foundation of this architecture is graph neural networks (GNNs), which are adept at accommodating a variety of shapes and forms. Additionally, we explore the parallels between GNNs and traditional numerical solvers, facilitating a seamless integration of conservative principles and symmetries into machine learning models. Our findings from experiments demonstrate that the model's inclusion of physical laws significantly enhances its generalizability, i.e., no significant accuracy degradation for unseen spatial domains while other models degrade.

        <tr id="Deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision by introducing large scale neural networks with millions of parameters. Training these networks requires massive datasets and leads to intransparent models that can fail to generalize. At the other extreme, models designed from partial differential equations (PDEs) embed specialized domain knowledge into mathematical equations and usually rely on few manually chosen hyperparameters. This makes them transparent by construction and if designed and calibrated carefully, they can generalize well to unseen scenarios. In this paper, we show how to bring model- and data-driven approaches together by combining the explicit PDE-based approaches with convolutional neural networks to obtain the best of both worlds. We illustrate a joint architecture for the task of inpainting optical flow fields and show that the combination of model- and data-driven modeling leads to an effective architecture. Our model outperforms both fully explicit and fully data-driven baselines in terms of reconstruction quality, robustness and amount of required training data. Averaging the endpoint error across different mask densities, our method outperforms the explicit baselines by 11-27%, the GAN baseline by 47% and the Probabilisitic Diffusion baseline by 42%. With that, our method sets a new state of the art for inpainting of optical flow fields from random masks.">

        <tr id="Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs and susceptibility to local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

        <tr id="Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) are powerful generative models showing competitive performance in various domains, including image synthesis and 3D point cloud generation. However, sampling from pre-trained DPMs involves multiple neural function evaluations (NFE) to transform Gaussian noise samples into images, resulting in higher computational costs compared to single-step generative models such as GANs or VAEs. Therefore, a crucial problem is to reduce NFE while preserving generation quality. To this end, we propose LD3, a lightweight framework for learning time discretization while sampling from the diffusion ODE encapsulated by DPMs. LD3 can be combined with various diffusion ODE solvers and consistently improves performance without retraining resource-intensive neural networks. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that LD3 enhances sampling efficiency compared to distillation-based methods, without the extensive computational overhead. We evaluate our method with extensive experiments on 5 datasets, covering unconditional and conditional sampling in both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs. For example, in about 5 minutes of training on a single GPU, our method reduces the FID score from 6.63 to 2.68 on CIFAR10 (7 NFE), and in around 20 minutes, decreases the FID from 8.51 to 5.03 on class-conditional ImageNet-256 (5 NFE).

        <tr id="Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.">

The resulting method is highly parallelizable and does not require spatial gradients for the loss. We provide a comprehensive comparison against competing methods based on PINNs, the Deep Ritz method, and (backward) stochastic differential equations.

To efficiently train the tKRnet, an adaptive procedure is developed to generate collocation points for the corresponding residual loss function, where samples are generated iteratively using the approximate density function at each iteration.

Recent studies such as the neural ordinary differential equation proposed a time-dependent neural network, which provides a neural network varying with respect to time. However, we claim that the architectural choice to build a time-dependent neural network significantly affects its time-awareness but still lacks sufficient validation in its current states. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the architecture of modern time-dependent neural networks. Here, we report a vulnerability of vanishing timestep embedding, which disables the time-awareness of a time-dependent neural network. Furthermore, we find that this vulnerability can also be observed in diffusion models because they employ a similar architecture that incorporates timestep embedding to discriminate between different timesteps during a diffusion process. Our analysis provides a detailed description of this phenomenon as well as several solutions to address the root cause. Through experiments on neural ordinary differential equations and diffusion models, we observed that ensuring alive time-awareness via proposed solutions boosted their performance, which implies that their current implementations lack sufficient time-dependency.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

In response, we developed a new spatiotemporal method that effectively handles such randomly sampled data. Our model integrates techniques from amortized variational inference, neural differential equations, neural point processes, and implicit neural representations to predict both the dynamics of the system and the probabilistic locations and timings of future observations. It outperforms existing methods on challenging spatiotemporal datasets by offering substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a useful tool for modeling and understanding complex dynamical systems observed under realistic, unconstrained conditions.">

However, in reality, many practical applications still depend on well-established but non-automatic-differentiable legacy codes, which prevents practitioners from applying the state-of-the-art research to their own problems. To resolve this problem, we propose a non-intrusive methodology with a novel gradient estimation technique to combine machine learning and legacy numerical codes without any modification.

        <tr id="Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve the PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a specific set of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation or a finite set of coefficients. This bottleneck limits the generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major advantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a Transformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable generalizability and scalability.">

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called"seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.">

        <tr id="Continuous-time generative models, such as Flow Matching (FM), construct probability paths to transport between one distribution and another through the simulation-free learning of the neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). During inference, however, the learned model often requires multiple neural network evaluations to accurately integrate the flow, resulting in a slow sampling speed. We attribute the reason to the inherent (joint) heterogeneity of source and/or target distributions, namely the singularity problem, which poses challenges for training the neural ODEs effectively. To address this issue, we propose a more general framework, termed Switched FM (SFM), that eliminates singularities via switching ODEs, as opposed to using a uniform ODE in FM. Importantly, we theoretically show that FM cannot transport between two simple distributions due to the existence and uniqueness of initial value problems of ODEs, while these limitations can be well tackled by SFM. From an orthogonal perspective, our framework can seamlessly integrate with the existing advanced techniques, such as minibatch optimal transport, to further enhance the straightness of the flow, yielding a more efficient sampling process with reduced costs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed SFM through several numerical examples.">

To this end, neural operators, which learn mappings from parameters to solutions, have been successfully used. However, the training of neural operators typically demands large training datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, physics-informed training can offer a cost-effective strategy. However, current physics-informed neural operators face limitations, either in handling irregular domain shapes or in generalization to various discretizations of PDE parameters with variable mesh sizes. In this research, we introduce a novel physics-informed model architecture which can generalize to parameter discretizations of variable size and irregular domain shapes. Particularly, inspired by deep operator neural networks, our model involves a discretization-independent learning of parameter embedding repeatedly, and this parameter embedding is integrated with the response embeddings through multiple compositional layers, for more expressivity. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.">

        <tr id="Reduced order modeling lowers the computational cost of solving PDEs by learning a low-order spatial representation from data and dynamically evolving these representations using manifold projections of the governing equations. While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.">

        <tr id="Besides classical feed-forward neural networks, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated to a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps a linear transformation of the input to a linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points. These properties can be characterized via Morse functions, which are scalar functions, where every critical point is non-degenerate. We prove that critical points cannot exist, if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that each critical point is non-degenerate, if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and in the infinite depth case. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding, i.e.\ on the exact representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs. Our dynamical systems viewpoint on the geometric structure of the input-output map provides a fundamental understanding, why certain architectures perform better than others.">

Our approach leverages the stochastic interpolant framework, simulation dynamics, and adversarial training to optimize the inference pathway. Notably, incorporating tensor-valued time during training improves some models' inference performance, even without path optimization. When the adaptive, multidimensional path derived from our optimization process is employed, further performance gains are achieved despite the fixed solver configurations. The introduction of tensor-valued time not only enhances the efficiency of models but also opens new avenues for exploration in training and inference methodologies, highlighting the potential of adaptive multidimensional paths.">

Machine learning methods for solving the Allen-Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives through automatic differentiation, and the large system size required by the space-time approach. To overcome these limitations, we propose a separable neural network-based approximation of the phase field in a minimizing movement scheme to solve the aforementioned gradient flow problem. At each time step, the separable neural network is used to approximate the phase field in space through a low-rank tensor decomposition thereby accelerating the derivative calculations. The minimizing movement scheme naturally allows for the use of Gauss quadrature technique to compute the functional. A `$tanh$' transformation is applied on the neural network-predicted phase field to strictly bounds the solutions within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, a theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that bounding the solution through this transformation is the key to effectively model sharp interfaces through separable neural network. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for phase separation problems and is an order of magnitude faster than the finite element method.">

DDDMs train the diffusion model conditioned on an estimated target that was generated from previous training iterations of its own. To generate images, samples generated from the previous time step are also taken into consideration, guiding the generation process iteratively. We further propose Pseudo-LPIPS, a novel metric loss that is more robust to various values of hyperparameter.

For example, classical fully-connected feed-forward NNs fail to approximate continuous functions whose gradient is discontinuous when employing strong formulations like in Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). In this article, we propose the use of regularity-conforming neural networks, where a priori information on the regularity of solutions to PDEs can be employed to construct proper architectures. We illustrate the potential of such architectures via a two-dimensional (2D) transmission problem, where the solution may admit discontinuities in the gradient across interfaces, as well as power-like singularities at certain points. In particular, we formulate the weak transmission problem in a PINNs-like strong formulation with interface and continuity conditions. Such architectures are partially explainable; discontinuities are explicitly described, allowing the introduction of novel terms into the loss function. We demonstrate via several model problems in one and two dimensions the advantages of using regularity-conforming architectures in contrast to classical architectures.

In this paper, we identify two sources of this issue in the case of Cauchy problems: the use of $L^2$ residuals as objective functions and the approximation gap of neural networks. We show that minimizing the sum of $L^2$ residual and initial condition error is not sufficient to guarantee the true solution, as this loss function does not capture the underlying dynamics. Additionally, neural networks are not capable of capturing singularities in the solutions due to the non-compactness of their image sets. This, in turn, influences the existence of global minima and the regularity of the network. We demonstrate that when the global minimum does not exist, machine precision becomes the predominant source of achievable error in practice. We also present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.">

        <tr id="On the forefront of scientific computing, Deep Learning (DL), i.e., machine learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has emerged a powerful new tool for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

This can often complicate the reverse process' task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the standard Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM's strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM's capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories, and demonstrate how the framework may be adopted for learning bridges between two distributions. The results underscores NFDM's versatility and its potential for a wide range of applications.">

Whilst numerical methods are higher fidelity, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning methods on the other hand are lower fidelity but provide significant speed-ups. The emergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in fluid dynamics has allowed scientists to directly use PDEs for evaluating loss functions in an unsupervised manner. The downfall of this approach is that the differential form of systems is invalid at regions of shock inherent in hyperbolic PDEs such as the compressible Euler equations. To circumvent this problem we propose a modification to PDE-based PINN losses by using a finite volume-based loss function that incorporates the flux of Godunov-type methods. These Godunov-type methods are also known as approximate Riemann solvers and evaluate intercell fluxes in an entropy-satisfying manner, yielding more physically accurate shocks. Our approach increases fidelity compared to using regularized PDE-based PINN losses, as tested on the 2D Riemann problem.">

        <tr id="For partial differential equations on domains of arbitrary shapes, existing works of neural operators attempt to learn a mapping from geometries to solutions. It often requires a large dataset of geometry-solution pairs in order to obtain a sufficiently accurate neural operator. However, for many industrial applications, e.g., engineering design optimization, it can be prohibitive to satisfy the requirement since even a single simulation may take hours or days of computation. To address this issue, we propose reference neural operators (RNO), a novel way of implementing neural operators, i.e., to learn the smooth dependence of solutions on geometric deformations. Specifically, given a reference solution, RNO can predict solutions corresponding to arbitrary deformations of the referred geometry. This approach turns out to be much more data efficient. Through extensive experiments, we show that RNO can learn the dependence across various types and different numbers of geometry objects with relatively small datasets. RNO outperforms baseline models in accuracy by a large lead and achieves up to 80% error reduction.">

Another approach is to take advantage of small graph neural networks (GNNs) to construct preconditioners of the predefined sparsity pattern. In our work, we recall well-established preconditioners from linear algebra and use them as a starting point for training the GNN.

Our construction of NGOs is derived directly from the Green's formulation of such a solution operator. Similar to deep operator networks (DeepONets) and variationally mimetic operator networks (VarMiONs), NGOs constitutes an expansion of the solution to the PDE in terms of basis functions, that is returned from a sub-network, contracted with coefficients, that are returned from another sub-network. However, in accordance with the Green's formulation, NGOs accept weighted averages of the input functions, rather than sampled values thereof, as is the case in DeepONets and VarMiONs. Application of NGOs to canonical linear parametric PDEs shows that, while they remain competitive with DeepONets, VarMiONs and Fourier neural operators when testing on data that lie within the training distribution, they robustly generalize when testing on finer-scale data generated outside of the training distribution. Furthermore, we show that the explicit representation of the Green's function that is returned by NGOs enables the construction of effective preconditioners for numerical solvers for PDEs.">

The lower level loss function includes the L2 norms of both the residual and its derivative with respect to the PDE parameters. We apply gradient descent simultaneously on both the upper and lower level optimization problems, leading to an effective and fast algorithm. The method, which we refer to as BiLO (Bilevel Local Operator learning), is also able to efficiently infer unknown functions in the PDEs through the introduction of an auxiliary variable.

To overcome this challenge, in this paper, leveraging the score-based generative diffusion model, we introduce a novel unsupervised inversion methodology tailored for solving inverse problems arising from PDEs. Our approach operates within the Bayesian inversion framework, treating the task of solving the posterior distribution as a conditional generation process achieved through solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation.

Such operator learning models not only predict particular instances of a physical or biological system in real-time but also forecast classes of solutions corresponding to a distribution of initial and boundary conditions or forcing terms. % DeepONet is the first neural operator model and has been tested extensively for a broad class of solutions, including Riemann problems. Transformers have not been used in that capacity, and specifically, they have not been tested for solutions of PDEs with low regularity. % In this work, we first establish the theoretical groundwork that transformers possess the universal approximation property as operator learning models. We then apply transformers to forecast solutions of diverse dynamical systems with solutions of finite regularity for a plurality of initial conditions and forcing terms. In particular, we consider three examples: the Izhikevich neuron model, the tempered fractional-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, and the one-dimensional Euler equation Riemann problem. For the latter problem, we also compare with variants of DeepONet, and we find that transformers outperform DeepONet in accuracy but they are computationally more expensive.">

Conventionally, adjoint solvers need to be implemented by differentiating computational models, which can be a cumbersome task and is code-specific. To propose an adjoint solver that is not code-specific, we develop a data-driven strategy. We demonstrate its application on the computation of gradients of long-time averages of chaotic flows. First, we deploy a parameter-aware echo state network (ESN) to accurately forecast and simulate the dynamics of a dynamical system for a range of system's parameters. Second, we derive the adjoint of the parameter-aware ESN. Finally, we combine the parameter-aware ESN with its adjoint version to compute the sensitivities to the system parameters. We showcase the method on a prototypical chaotic system. Because adjoint sensitivities in chaotic regimes diverge for long integration times, we analyse the application of ensemble adjoint method to the ESN. We find that the adjoint sensitivities obtained from the ESN match closely with the original system. This work opens possibilities for sensitivity analysis without code-specific adjoint solvers.">

This is motivated by the fact that differential deep learning can provide an efficient approximation of the labels and their derivatives with respect to inputs. The BSDEs are reformulated as differential deep learning problems by using Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin derivatives of solution to a BSDE satisfy themselves another BSDE, resulting thus in a system of BSDEs. Such formulation requires the estimation of the solution, its gradient, and the Hessian matrix, represented by the triple of processes $\left(Y, Z, \Gamma\right).$ All the integrals within this system are discretized by using the Euler-Maruyama method. Subsequently, DNNs are employed to approximate the triple of these unknown processes. The DNN parameters are backwardly optimized at each time step by minimizing a differential learning type loss function, which is defined as a weighted sum of the dynamics of the discretized BSDE system, with the first term providing the dynamics of the process $Y$ and the other the process $Z$. An error analysis is carried out to show the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Various numerical experiments up to $50$ dimensions are provided to demonstrate the high efficiency. Both theoretically and numerically, it is demonstrated that our proposed scheme is more efficient compared to other contemporary deep learning-based methodologies, especially in the computation of the process $\Gamma$.">

        <tr id="Adjoint methods have been the pillar of gradient-based optimization for decades. They enable the accurate computation of a gradient (sensitivity) of a quantity of interest with respect to all system's parameters in one calculation. When the gradient is embedded in an optimization routine, the quantity of interest can be optimized for the system to have the desired behaviour. Adjoint methods require the system's Jacobian, whose computation can be cumbersome, and is problem dependent. We propose a computational strategy to infer the adjoint sensitivities from data (observables), which bypasses the need of the Jacobian of the physical system. The key component of this strategy is an echo state network, which learns the dynamics of nonlinear regimes with varying parameters, and evolves dynamically via a hidden state. Although the framework is general, we focus on thermoacoustics governed by nonlinear and time-delayed systems. First, we show that a parameter-aware Echo State Network (ESN) infers the parameterized dynamics. Second, we derive the adjoint of the ESN to compute the sensitivity of time-averaged cost functionals. Third, we propose the Thermoacoustic Echo State Network (T-ESN), which hard constrains the physical knowledge in the network architecture. Fourth, we apply the framework to a variety of nonlinear thermoacoustic regimes of a prototypical system. We show that the T-ESN accurately infers the correct adjoint sensitivities of the time-averaged acoustic energy with respect to the flame parameters. The results are robust to noisy data, from periodic, through quasiperiodic, to chaotic regimes. A single network predicts the nonlinear bifurcations on unseen scenarios, and so the inferred adjoint sensitivities are employed to suppress an instability via steepest descent. This work opens new possibilities for gradient-based data-driven design optimization.">

In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), to investigate and explore the solution of the generalized non-linear sine-Gordon equation, encompassing Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. To incorporate physical information for the sine-Gordon equation, a multiobjective loss function has been defined consisting of the residual of governing partial differential equation (PDE), initial conditions, and various boundary conditions. Using multiple densely connected independent artificial neural networks (ANNs), called feedforward deep neural networks designed to handle partial differential equations, PINNs have been trained through automatic differentiation to minimize a loss function that incorporates the given PDE that governs the physical laws of phenomena. To illustrate the effectiveness, validity, and practical implications of our proposed approach, two computational examples from the nonlinear sine-Gordon are presented. We have developed a PINN algorithm and implemented it using Python software. Various experiments were conducted to determine an optimal neural architecture. The network training was employed by using the current state-of-the-art optimization methods in machine learning known as Adam and L-BFGS-B minimization techniques. Additionally, the solutions from the proposed method are compared with the established analytical solutions found in the literature. The findings show that the proposed method is a computational machine learning approach that is accurate and efficient for solving nonlinear sine-Gordon equations with a variety of boundary conditions as well as any complex nonlinear physical problems across multiple disciplines.">

This is combined with a physics-aware implicit solver that consists of a much coarser, discretized version of the original PDE, which provides the requisite information bottleneck for high-dimensional problems and enables generalization in out-of-distribution settings (e.g. different boundary conditions). We demonstrate its capability in the context of random heterogeneous materials where the input parameters represent the material microstructure. We extend the framework to multiscale problems and show that a surrogate can be learned for the effective (homogenized) solution without ever solving the reference problem.

Nonlinearities, such as activation functions and nonlinear pooling layers, are handled with integral quadratic constraints. If the neural network contains signal processing layers (convolutional or state space model layers), we realize them as 1-D/2-D/N-D systems and exploit this structure as well. We distinguish ourselves from related work on Lipschitz constant estimation by more extensive structure exploitation (scalability) and a generalization to a large class of common neural network architectures.

Second, it outlines a method for establishing an upper bound on the absolute deviation from the exact solution. Third, it introduces a technique for converting problems with Neumann or Robin conditions into equivalent problems with parametric Dirichlet conditions. The proposed optimized neural forms were numerically tested on a set of diverse problems, encompassing first-order and second-order ordinary differential equations, as well as first-order systems. Stiff and delay differential equations were also considered. The obtained solutions were compared against solutions obtained via Runge-Kutta methods and exact solutions wherever available.

This paper proposes a novel framework: a closed-form \textbf{Sym}bolic framework for \textbf{PDE}s (SymPDE), exploring the use of deep reinforcement learning to directly obtain symbolic solutions for PDEs. SymPDE alleviates the challenges PINNs face in fitting high-frequency and steeply changing functions. To our knowledge, no prior work has implemented this approach. Experiments on solving the Poisson's equation and heat equation in time-independent and spatiotemporal dynamical systems respectively demonstrate that SymPDE can provide accurate closed-form symbolic solutions for various types of PDEs.">

One algorithm enforces the equation and initial boundary conditions to hold on some collocation points, and another algorithm enforces $L^2$-norm of the residual of the equation and initial boundary conditions to be $0$. Our method can achieve high accuracy with low cost of training. Moreover, our method is free of parameters that need to be artificially adjusted. Numerical examples show that the cost of training these base functions of subspace is low, and only one hundred to two thousand epochs are needed for most tests.

Based on the theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge, this method directly learns to simulate an Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that connects the output distribution of a single ensemble member to the output distribution of the ensembled model, allowing us to obtain ensemble prediction without having to invoke forward pass through all the ensemble models. By substituting the heavy ensembles with this lightweight neural network constructing DBN, we achieved inference with reduced computational cost while maintaining accuracy and uncertainty scores on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet.

In this article, we propose to use graph kernels, i.e., kernel functions that compute an inner product on graphs, to extend the standard convolution operator to the graph domain. This allows us to define an entirely structural model that does not require computing the embedding of the input graph. Our architecture allows to plug-in any type of graph kernels and has the added benefit of providing some interpretability in terms of the structural masks that are learned during the training process, similar to what happens for convolutional masks in traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We perform an extensive ablation study to investigate the model hyperparameters' impact and show that our model achieves competitive performance on standard graph classification and regression datasets.">

These include linear mode connectivity, model merging, Bayesian neural network inference, metanetworks, and several other characteristics of optimization or loss-landscapes. However, theoretical analysis of the relationship between parameter space symmetries and these phenomena is difficult. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of neural parameter symmetries by introducing new neural network architectures that have reduced parameter space symmetries. We develop two methods, with some provable guarantees, of modifying standard neural networks to reduce parameter space symmetries. With these new methods, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study consisting of multiple tasks aimed at assessing the effect of removing parameter symmetries. Our experiments reveal several interesting observations on the empirical impact of parameter symmetries; for instance, we observe linear mode connectivity between our networks without alignment of weight spaces, and we find that our networks allow for faster and more effective Bayesian neural network training.">

Despite their promising performance in tasks like image translation, DDBMs require a computationally intensive sampling process that involves the simulation of a (stochastic) differential equation through hundreds of network evaluations. In this work, we present diffusion bridge implicit models (DBIMs) for accelerated sampling of diffusion bridges without extra training. We generalize DDBMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion bridges defined on the discretized timesteps concerning sampling, which share the same training objective as DDBMs. These generalized diffusion bridges give rise to generative processes ranging from stochastic to deterministic (i.e., an implicit probabilistic model) while being up to 25$\times$ faster than the vanilla sampler of DDBMs. Moreover, the deterministic sampling procedure yielded by DBIMs enables faithful encoding and reconstruction by a booting noise used in the initial sampling step, and allows us to perform semantically meaningful interpolation in image translation tasks by regarding the booting noise as the latent variable.">

To aid in both stable training and enhanced accuracy over a variety of problems, we present (1) a family of orthogonality constraints that impose mutual orthogonality between the polynomial and the DNN within a PANN; (2) a simple basis pruning approach to combat the curse of dimensionality introduced by the polynomial component; and (3) an adaptation of a polynomial preconditioning strategy to both DNNs and polynomials.

As such, neural network approximations of control feedback laws, system dynamics, and even Lyapunov functions have attracted growing attention. With the ascent of learning based control, the need for accurate, fast, and easy-to-use benchmarks has increased. In this work, we present the first learning-based environment for boundary control of PDEs. In our benchmark, we introduce three foundational PDE problems - a 1D transport PDE, a 1D reaction-diffusion PDE, and a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE - whose solvers are bundled in an user-friendly reinforcement learning gym. With this gym, we then present the first set of model-free, reinforcement learning algorithms for solving this series of benchmark problems, achieving stability, although at a higher cost compared to model-based PDE backstepping. With the set of benchmark environments and detailed examples, this work significantly lowers the barrier to entry for learning-based PDE control - a topic largely unexplored by the data-driven control community. The entire benchmark is available on Github along with detailed documentation and the presented reinforcement learning models are open sourced.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models (DMs) have established themselves as the state-of-the-art generative modeling approach in the visual domain and beyond. A crucial drawback of DMs is their slow sampling speed, relying on many sequential function evaluations through large neural networks. Sampling from DMs can be seen as solving a differential equation through a discretized set of noise levels known as the sampling schedule. While past works primarily focused on deriving efficient solvers, little attention has been given to finding optimal sampling schedules, and the entire literature relies on hand-crafted heuristics. In this work, for the first time, we propose a general and principled approach to optimizing the sampling schedules of DMs for high-quality outputs, called $\textit{Align Your Steps}$. We leverage methods from stochastic calculus and find optimal schedules specific to different solvers, trained DMs and datasets. We evaluate our novel approach on several image, video as well as 2D toy data synthesis benchmarks, using a variety of different samplers, and observe that our optimized schedules outperform previous hand-crafted schedules in almost all experiments. Our method demonstrates the untapped potential of sampling schedule optimization, especially in the few-step synthesis regime.">

        <tr id="This paper is about learning the parameter-to-solution map for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) that depend on a potentially large number of parameters covering all PDE types for which a stable variational formulation (SVF) can be found. A central constituent is the notion of variationally correct residual loss function meaning that its value is always uniformly proportional to the squared solution error in the norm determined by the SVF, hence facilitating rigorous a posteriori accuracy control. It is based on a single variational problem, associated with the family of parameter dependent fiber problems, employing the notion of direct integrals of Hilbert spaces. Since in its original form the loss function is given as a dual test norm of the residual a central objective is to develop equivalent computable expressions. A first critical role is played by hybrid hypothesis classes, whose elements are piecewise polynomial in (low-dimensional) spatio-temporal variables with parameter-dependent coefficients that can be represented, e.g. by neural networks. Second, working with first order SVFs, we distinguish two scenarios: (i) the test space can be chosen as an $L_2$-space (e.g. for elliptic or parabolic problems) so that residuals live in $L_2$ and can be evaluated directly; (ii) when trial and test spaces for the fiber problems (e.g. for transport equations) depend on the parameters, we use ultraweak formulations. In combination with Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin concepts the hybrid format is then instrumental to arrive at variationally correct computable residual loss functions. Our findings are illustrated by numerical experiments representing (i) and (ii), namely elliptic boundary value problems with piecewise constant diffusion coefficients and pure transport equations with parameter dependent convection field.">

        <tr id="The residual loss in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) alters the simple recursive relation of layers in a feed-forward neural network by applying a differential operator, resulting in a loss landscape that is inherently different from those of common supervised problems. Therefore, relying on the existing theory leads to unjustified design choices and suboptimal performance. In this work, we analyze the residual loss by studying its characteristics at critical points to find the conditions that result in effective training of PINNs. Specifically, we first show that under certain conditions, the residual loss of PINNs can be globally minimized by a wide neural network. Furthermore, our analysis also reveals that an activation function with well-behaved high-order derivatives plays a crucial role in minimizing the residual loss. In particular, to solve a $k$-th order PDE, the $k$-th derivative of the activation function should be bijective. The established theory paves the way for designing and choosing effective activation functions for PINNs and explains why periodic activations have shown promising performance in certain cases. Finally, we verify our findings by conducting a set of experiments on several PDEs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nimahsn/pinns_tf2.">

        <tr id="The generative modeling of data on manifold is an important task, for which diffusion models in flat spaces typically need nontrivial adaptations. This article demonstrates how a technique called `trivialization' can transfer the effectiveness of diffusion models in Euclidean spaces to Lie groups. In particular, an auxiliary momentum variable was algorithmically introduced to help transport the position variable between data distribution and a fixed, easy-to-sample distribution. Normally, this would incur further difficulty for manifold data because momentum lives in a space that changes with the position. However, our trivialization technique creates to a new momentum variable that stays in a simple $\textbf{fixed vector space}$. This design, together with a manifold preserving integrator, simplifies implementation and avoids inaccuracies created by approximations such as projections to tangent space and manifold, which were typically used in prior work, hence facilitating generation with high-fidelity and efficiency. The resulting method achieves state-of-the-art performance on protein and RNA torsion angle generation and sophisticated torus datasets. We also, arguably for the first time, tackle the generation of data on high-dimensional Special Orthogonal and Unitary groups, the latter essential for quantum problems.">

However, deep learning architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the simulation of these PDEs. This paper clearly articulates and then solves this incompatibility. The local-dependency of generic transport PDEs implies that it only involves local information to predict the physical properties at a location in the next time step. However, the deep learning architecture will inevitably increase the scope of information to make such predictions as the number of layers increases, which can cause sluggish convergence and compromise generalizability. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a distributed data scoping method with linear time complexity to strictly limit the scope of information to predict the local properties. The numerical experiments over multiple physics show that our data scoping method significantly accelerates training convergence and improves the generalizability of benchmark models on large-scale engineering simulations. Specifically, over the geometries not included in the training data for heat transferring simulation, it can increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 21.7 \% and that of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by 38.5 \% on average.">

We seek to improve this suboptimal practice in the context of physics simulations, where backpropagating feedback through many unrolled time steps is considered crucial to acquiring temporally coherent behavior. The alternative vector field we propose follows from two principles: physics simulators, unlike neural networks, have a balanced gradient flow, and certain modifications to the backpropagation pass leave the positions of the original minima unchanged. As any modification of backpropagation decouples forward and backward pass, the rotation-free character of the gradient field is lost. Therefore, we discuss the negative implications of using such a rotational vector field for optimization and how to counteract them. Our final procedure is easily implementable via a sequence of gradient stopping and component-wise comparison operations, which do not negatively affect scalability. Our experiments on three control problems show that especially as we increase the complexity of each task, the unbalanced updates from the gradient can no longer provide the precise control signals necessary while our method still solves the tasks.

        <tr id="Sampling invariant distributions from an Ito diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in both biased and correlated samples. Current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from the base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for mini-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Distinct from conventional generative models, our method neither necessitates the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centres selected from the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.">

The proposed techniques are shown to be particularly suitable for non-parametric geometries, ultimately enabling the treatment of a diverse range of geometries and topologies. Performance studies are presented in an application context related to the design of aircraft seats and their corresponding mechanical responses to shocks, where the main motivation is to reduce the computational burden and enable the rapid design iteration for such problems that entail non-parametric geometries.

In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.">

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments.

Owing to its differentiable nature, BFNs are promising in modeling both continuous and discrete data, while simultaneously maintaining fast sampling capabilities. This paper aims to understand and enhance BFNs by connecting them with DMs through stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We identify the linear SDEs corresponding to the noise-addition processes in BFNs, demonstrate that BFN's regression losses are aligned with denoise score matching, and validate the sampler in BFN as a first-order solver for the respective reverse-time SDE. Based on these findings and existing recipes of fast sampling in DMs, we propose specialized solvers for BFNs that markedly surpass the original BFN sampler in terms of sample quality with a limited number of function evaluations (e.g., 10) on both image and text datasets. Notably, our best sampler achieves an increase in speed of 5~20 times for free. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/BFN-Solver.">

        <tr id="The primal approach to physics-informed learning is a residual minimization. We argue that residual is, at best, an indirect measure of the error of approximate solution and propose to train with error majorant instead. Since error majorant provides a direct upper bound on error, one can reliably estimate how close PiNN is to the exact solution and stop the optimization process when the desired accuracy is reached. We call loss function associated with error majorant $\textbf{Astral}$: neur$\textbf{A}$l a po$\textbf{ST}$erio$\textbf{RI}$ function$\textbf{A}$l Loss. To compare Astral and residual loss functions, we illustrate how error majorants can be derived for various PDEs and conduct experiments with diffusion equations (including anisotropic and in the L-shaped domain), convection-diffusion equation, temporal discretization of Maxwell's equation, and magnetostatics problem. The results indicate that Astral loss is competitive to the residual loss, typically leading to faster convergence and lower error (e.g., for Maxwell's equations, we observe an order of magnitude better relative error and training time). We also report that the error estimate obtained with Astral loss is usually tight enough to be informative, e.g., for a highly anisotropic equation, on average, Astral overestimates error by a factor of $1.5$, and for convection-diffusion by a factor of $1.7$.">

In this paper, we propose a symmetry group based domain decomposition strategy to enhance the PINN for solving the forward and inverse problems of the PDEs possessing a Lie symmetry group. Specifically, for the forward problem, we first deploy the symmetry group to generate the dividing-lines having known solution information which can be adjusted flexibly and are used to divide the whole training domain into a finite number of non-overlapping sub-domains, then utilize the PINN and the symmetry-enhanced PINN methods to learn the solutions in each sub-domain and finally stitch them to the overall solution of PDEs. For the inverse problem, we first utilize the symmetry group acting on the data of the initial and boundary conditions to generate labeled data in the interior domain of PDEs and then find the undetermined parameters as well as the solution by only training the neural networks in a sub-domain. Consequently, the proposed method can predict high-accuracy solutions of PDEs which are failed by the vanilla PINN in the whole domain and the extended physics-informed neural network in the same sub-domains. Numerical results of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with a translation symmetry and the nonlinear viscous fluid equation with a scaling symmetry show that the accuracies of the learned solutions are improved largely.">

This in turn enables its use for various INR tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, one can learn state-of-the-art INRs based on a DNN composed of only ReLU neurons. Next, by leveraging recent theoretical works which characterize the kinds of functions ReLU neural networks learn, we provide a way to quantify the regularity of the learned function. This offers a principled approach to selecting the hyperparameters in INR architectures.

The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by solving numerically the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization and the score approximation. In this paper, we study theoretically the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this restricted framework where the score function is a linear operator, we can derive the analytical solutions of the forward and backward SDEs as well as the associated flow ODE. This provides exact expressions for various Wasserstein errors which enable us to compare the influence of each error type for any sampling scheme, thus allowing to monitor convergence directly in the data space instead of relying on Inception features. Our experiments show that the recommended numerical schemes from the diffusion models literature are also the best sampling schemes for Gaussian distributions.">

However, simulating the diffusion bridge for natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain unresolved. In the paper, we present a solution to this problem by merging score-matching techniques with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to score-matching for the infinite-dimensional bridge. We construct the score to be discretization invariant, which is natural given the underlying spatially continuous process. We conduct a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data, and our method demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution without extra training.">

These models are usually solved with topology optimization algorithms based on sensitivity analysis, in which it is expensive to repeatedly solve the nonlinear constrained eigenvalue problem with traditional numerical methods such as finite elements or finite differences. In contrast, our method leverages automatic differentiation within the deep learning framework. Furthermore, the adversarial neural networks enable different neural networks to train independently, which improves the training efficiency and achieve satisfactory optimization results. Numerical results are presented to verify effectiveness of the algorithms for maximizing and minimizing the first eigenvalues.">

        <tr id="The joint prediction of continuous fields and statistical estimation of the underlying discrete parameters is a common problem for many physical systems, governed by PDEs. Hitherto, it has been separately addressed by employing operator learning surrogates for field prediction while using simulation-based inference (and its variants) for statistical parameter determination. Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.">

        <tr id="There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.">

        <tr id="Generative models based on flow matching have attracted significant attention for their simplicity and superior performance in high-resolution image synthesis. By leveraging the instantaneous change-of-variables formula, one can directly compute image likelihoods from a learned flow, making them enticing candidates as priors for downstream tasks such as inverse problems. In particular, a natural approach would be to incorporate such image probabilities in a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation problem. A major obstacle, however, lies in the slow computation of the log-likelihood, as it requires backpropagating through an ODE solver, which can be prohibitively slow for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an iterative algorithm to approximate the MAP estimator efficiently to solve a variety of linear inverse problems. Our algorithm is mathematically justified by the observation that the MAP objective can be approximated by a sum of $N$ ``local MAP'' objectives, where $N$ is the number of function evaluations. By leveraging Tweedie's formula, we show that we can perform gradient steps to sequentially optimize these objectives. We validate our approach for various linear inverse problems, such as super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and compressed sensing, and demonstrate that we can outperform other methods based on flow matching.">

Two recent works introduced a geometric framework to study neural networks making use of singular Riemannian metrics. In this paper we extend these results to convolutional, residual and recursive neural networks, studying also the case of non-differentiable activation functions, such as ReLU.

They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learn- ing models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irreg- ular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based mod- els, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experi- ments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.">

In this paper we take some prototypical examples and, under standard hypothesis concerning the neural network convergence, we show that the optimal time sampling follows a truncated exponential distribution. In particular we explain when the time sampling is best to be uniform and when it should not be.

        <tr id="This article explores operator learning models that can deduce solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) on arbitrary domains without requiring retraining. We introduce two innovative models rooted in boundary integral equations (BIEs): the Boundary Integral Type Deep Operator Network (BI-DeepONet) and the Boundary Integral Trigonometric Deep Operator Neural Network (BI-TDONet), which are crafted to address PDEs across diverse domains. Once fully trained, these BIE-based models adeptly predict the solutions of PDEs in any domain without the need for additional training. BI-TDONet notably enhances its performance by employing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of bounded linear operators, allowing for the efficient distribution of input functions across its modules. Furthermore, to tackle the issue of function sampling values that do not effectively capture oscillatory and impulse signal characteristics, trigonometric coefficients are utilized as both inputs and outputs in BI-TDONet. Our numerical experiments robustly support and confirm the efficacy of this theoretical framework.">

Traditional methods relying on manually constructed formulas, finite differences, and autograd are laborious, approximate, and unstable for complex minimal problem solvers. We show that using the Implicit function theorem to calculate derivatives to backpropagate through the solution of a minimal problem solver is simple, fast, and stable. We compare our approach to (i) using the standard autograd on minimal problem solvers and relate it to existing backpropagation formulas through SVD-based and Eig-based solvers and (ii) implementing the backprop with an existing PyTorch Deep Declarative Networks (DDN) framework. We demonstrate our technique on a toy example of training outlier-rejection weights for 3D point registration and on a real application of training an outlier-rejection and RANSAC sampling network in image matching.

        <tr id="Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved great success in image generation and other fields. By fine sampling through the trajectory defined by the SDE/ODE solver based on a well-trained score model, DMs can generate remarkable high-quality results. However, this precise sampling often requires multiple steps and is computationally demanding. To address this problem, instance-based distillation methods have been proposed to distill a one-step generator from a DM by having a simpler student model mimic a more complex teacher model. Yet, our research reveals an inherent limitations in these methods: the teacher model, with more steps and more parameters, occupies different local minima compared to the student model, leading to suboptimal performance when the student model attempts to replicate the teacher. To avoid this problem, we introduce a novel distributional distillation method, which uses an exclusive distributional loss. This method exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) results while requiring significantly fewer training images. Additionally, we show that DMs' layers are activated differently at different time steps, leading to an inherent capability to generate images in a single step. Freezing most of the convolutional layers in a DM during distributional distillation leads to further performance improvements. Our method achieves the SOTA results on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.54), AFHQv2 64x64 (FID 1.23), FFHQ 64x64 (FID 0.85) and ImageNet 64x64 (FID 1.16) with great efficiency. Most of those results are obtained with only 5 million training images within 6 hours on 8 A100 GPUs. This breakthrough not only enhances the understanding of efficient image generation models but also offers a scalable framework for advancing the state of the art in various applications.">

In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality generative modelling method based on high-order Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score matching. This motive is proved by third-order Langevin dynamics. By augmenting the previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position, velocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data generation at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude. Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.">

Whilst simulating diffusion bridge processes is already difficult on Euclidean spaces, when considering diffusion processes on Riemannian manifolds the geometry brings in further complications. In even higher generality, advancing from Riemannian to sub-Riemannian geometries introduces hypoellipticity, and the possibility of finding appropriate explicit approximations for the score of the diffusion process is removed. We handle these challenges and construct a method for bridge simulation on sub-Riemannian manifolds by demonstrating how recent progress in machine learning can be modified to allow for training of score approximators on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Since gradients dependent on the horizontal distribution, we generalise the usual notion of denoising loss to work with non-holonomic frames using a stochastic Taylor expansion, and we demonstrate the resulting scheme both explicitly on the Heisenberg group and more generally using adapted coordinates. We perform numerical experiments exemplifying samples from the bridge process on the Heisenberg group and the concentration of this process for small time.">

However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm.

        <tr id="Using neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) is gaining popularity as an alternative approach in the scientific computing community. Neural networks can integrate different types of information into the loss function. These include observation data, governing equations, and variational forms, etc. These loss functions can be broadly categorized into two types: observation data loss directly constrains and measures the model output, while other loss functions indirectly model the performance of the network, which can be classified as model loss. However, this alternative approach lacks a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms, including theoretical foundations and rigorous characterization of various phenomena. This work focuses on investigating how different loss functions impact the training of neural networks for solving PDEs. We discover a stable loss-jump phenomenon: when switching the loss function from the data loss to the model loss, which includes different orders of derivative information, the neural network solution significantly deviates from the exact solution immediately. Further experiments reveal that this phenomenon arises from the different frequency preferences of neural networks under different loss functions. We theoretically analyze the frequency preference of neural networks under model loss. This loss-jump phenomenon provides a valuable perspective for examining the underlying mechanisms of neural networks in solving PDEs.">

The approach consists in the construction of a deep neural network model that approximates the solution manifold through a continuously adaptive local basis. In contrast to global methods, such as Principal Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), the adaptivity allows the DOD to overcome the Kolmogorov barrier, making the approach applicable to a wide spectrum of parametric problems. Furthermore, due to its hybrid linear-nonlinear nature, the DOD can accommodate both intrusive and nonintrusive techniques, providing highly interpretable latent representations and tighter control on error propagation. For this reason, the proposed approach stands out as a valuable alternative to other nonlinear techniques, such as deep autoencoders.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a novel and popular approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, achieving stable training and obtaining correct results remain a challenge in many cases, often attributed to the ill-conditioning of PINNs. Nonetheless, further analysis is still lacking, severely limiting the progress and applications of PINNs in complex engineering problems. Drawing inspiration from the ill-conditioning analysis in traditional numerical methods, we establish a connection between the ill-conditioning of PINNs and the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian matrix of the PDE system. Specifically, for any given PDE system, we construct its controlled system. This controlled system allows for adjustment of the condition number of the Jacobian matrix while retaining the same solution as the original system. Our numerical findings suggest that the ill-conditioning observed in PINNs predominantly stems from the Jacobian matrix. As the condition number of the Jacobian matrix decreases, PINNs exhibit faster convergence rates and higher accuracy. Building upon this understanding and the natural extension of controlled systems, we present a general approach to mitigate the ill-conditioning of PINNs, leading to successful simulations of the three-dimensional flow around the M6 wing at a Reynolds number of 5,000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PINNs have been successful in simulating such complex systems, offering a promising new technique for addressing industrial complexity problems. Our findings also offer valuable insights guiding the future development of PINNs.">

These underlying constraints are obtained following linear stability for dynamical systems. We further extend this approach for learning nonlinear differential operators by determining linear stability constraints for linearized equations around an equilibrium point. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated for both linear and nonlinear partial differential equations such as 1-D scalar advection-diffusion equation, 1-D Burgers equation and 2-D advection equation.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing outputs and gradients of deep models to satisfy target equations. Due to the limitation of numerical computation, PINNs are conventionally optimized on finite selected points. However, since PDEs are usually defined on continuous domains, solely optimizing models on scattered points may be insufficient to obtain an accurate solution for the whole domain. To mitigate this inherent deficiency of the default scatter-point optimization, this paper proposes and theoretically studies a new training paradigm as region optimization. Concretely, we propose to extend the optimization process of PINNs from isolated points to their continuous neighborhood regions, which can theoretically decrease the generalization error, especially for hidden high-order constraints of PDEs. A practical training algorithm, Region Optimized PINN (RoPINN), is seamlessly derived from this new paradigm, which is implemented by a straightforward but effective Monte Carlo sampling method. By calibrating the sampling process into trust regions, RoPINN finely balances sampling efficiency and generalization error. Experimentally, RoPINN consistently boosts the performance of diverse PINNs on a wide range of PDEs without extra backpropagation or gradient calculation.">

To tackle this challenge, we introduce SpecBoost, an ensemble learning framework that employs multiple FNOs to better capture high-frequency information. Specifically, a secondary FNO is utilized to learn the overlooked high-frequency information from the prediction residual of the initial FNO. Experiments demonstrate that SpecBoost noticeably enhances FNO's prediction accuracy on diverse PDE applications, achieving an up to 71% improvement.">

We introduce the notions of weakly and strongly invariant laws (WI and SI) on the parameter space of each single unit, corresponding, respectively, to $G$-invariant distributions, and to distributions supported on parameters fixed by the group action (which encode EA). This allows us to define symmetric models compatible with taking $N\to\infty$ and give an interpretation of the asymptotic dynamics of DA, FA and EA in terms of Wasserstein Gradient Flows describing their MF limits. When activations respect the group action, we show that, for symmetric data, DA, FA and freely-trained models obey the exact same MF dynamic, which stays in the space of WI laws and minimizes therein the population risk. We also give a counterexample to the general attainability of an optimum over SI laws. Despite this, quite remarkably, we show that the set of SI laws is also preserved by the MF dynamics even when freely trained. This sharply contrasts the finite-$N$ setting, in which EAs are generally not preserved by unconstrained SGD. We illustrate the validity of our findings as $N$ gets larger in a teacher-student experimental setting, training a student NN to learn from a WI, SI or arbitrary teacher model through various SL schemes. We last deduce a data-driven heuristic to discover the largest subspace of parameters supporting SI distributions for a problem, that could be used for designing EA with minimal generalization error.">

        <tr id="Generative modelling paradigms based on denoising diffusion processes have emerged as a leading candidate for conditional sampling in inverse problems. In many real-world applications, we often have access to large, expensively trained unconditional diffusion models, which we aim to exploit for improving conditional sampling. Most recent approaches are motivated heuristically and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between them. Further, they often suffer from issues such as being very sensitive to hyperparameters, being expensive to train or needing access to weights hidden behind a closed API. In this work, we unify conditional training and sampling using the mathematically well-understood Doob's h-transform. This new perspective allows us to unify many existing methods under a common umbrella. Under this framework, we propose DEFT (Doob's h-transform Efficient FineTuning), a new approach for conditional generation that simply fine-tunes a very small network to quickly learn the conditional $h$-transform, while keeping the larger unconditional network unchanged. DEFT is much faster than existing baselines while achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of linear and non-linear benchmarks. On image reconstruction tasks, we achieve speedups of up to 1.6$\times$, while having the best perceptual quality on natural images and reconstruction performance on medical images.">

To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.">

        <tr id="We extend a recently proposed machine-learning-based iterative solver, i.e. the hybrid iterative transferable solver (HINTS), to solve the scattering problem described by the Helmholtz equation in an exterior domain with a complex absorbing boundary condition. The HINTS method combines neural operators (NOs) with standard iterative solvers, e.g. Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel (GS), to achieve better performance by leveraging the spectral bias of neural networks. In HINTS, some iterations of the conventional iterative method are replaced by inferences of the pre-trained NO. In this work, we employ HINTS to solve the scattering problem for both 2D and 3D problems, where the standard iterative solver fails. We consider square and triangular scatterers of various sizes in 2D, and a cube and a model submarine in 3D. We explore and illustrate the extrapolation capability of HINTS in handling diverse geometries of the scatterer, which is achieved by training the NO on non-scattering scenarios and then deploying it in HINTS to solve scattering problems. The accurate results demonstrate that the NO in HINTS method remains effective without retraining or fine-tuning it whenever a new scatterer is given. Taken together, our results highlight the adaptability and versatility of the extended HINTS methodology in addressing diverse scattering problems.">

        <tr id="Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning (SciML) combines the powerful predictive power of SciML with methods for quantifying the reliability of the learned models. However, two major challenges remain: limited interpretability and expensive training procedures. We provide a new interpretation for UQ problems by establishing a new theoretical connection between some Bayesian inference problems arising in SciML and viscous Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs). Namely, we show that the posterior mean and covariance can be recovered from the spatial gradient and Hessian of the solution to a viscous HJ PDE. As a first exploration of this connection, we specialize to Bayesian inference problems with linear models, Gaussian likelihoods, and Gaussian priors. In this case, the associated viscous HJ PDEs can be solved using Riccati ODEs, and we develop a new Riccati-based methodology that provides computational advantages when continuously updating the model predictions. Specifically, our Riccati-based approach can efficiently add or remove data points to the training set invariant to the order of the data and continuously tune hyperparameters. Moreover, neither update requires retraining on or access to previously incorporated data. We provide several examples from SciML involving noisy data and \textit{epistemic uncertainty} to illustrate the potential advantages of our approach. In particular, this approach's amenability to data streaming applications demonstrates its potential for real-time inferences, which, in turn, allows for applications in which the predicted uncertainty is used to dynamically alter the learning process.">

The main computational bottleneck of typical algorithms is the direct estimation of the data misfit. Therefore, likelihood-free approaches have become appealing alternatives. Nonetheless, difficulties in generalization and limitations in accuracy have hindered their broader utility and applicability. In this work, we use a paired autoencoder framework as a likelihood-free estimator for inverse problems. We show that the use of such an architecture allows us to construct a solution efficiently and to overcome some known open problems when using likelihood-free estimators. In particular, our framework can assess the quality of the solution and improve on it if needed.

However, this transition in engineering software has faced challenges such as data scarcity, multi-modality of data, low model accuracy, and slow inference. Here, we propose a new network based on interpolation theories and tensor decomposition, the interpolating neural network (INN). Instead of interpolating training data, a common notion in computer science, INN interpolates interpolation points in the physical space whose coordinates and values are trainable. It can also extrapolate if the interpolation points reside outside of the range of training data and the interpolation functions have a larger support domain. INN features orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters, faster training, a smaller memory footprint, and higher model accuracy compared to feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or physics-informed neural networks (PINN). INN is poised to usher in Engineering Software 2.0, a unified neural network that spans various domains of space, time, parameters, and initial/boundary conditions. This has previously been computationally prohibitive due to the exponentially growing number of trainable parameters, easily exceeding the parameter size of ChatGPT, which is over 1 trillion.

They show attractive performance for ill-conditioned problems, in part because they better approximate the matrix inverse from appropriately generated training data. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable than other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES.

To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

        <tr id="Automatic differentiation is a key feature of present deep learning frameworks. Moreover, they typically provide various ways to specify custom gradients within the computation graph, which is of particular importance for defining surrogate gradients in the realms of non-differentiable operations such as the Heaviside function in spiking neural networks (SNNs). PyTorch, for example, allows the custom specification of the backward pass of an operation by overriding its backward method. Other frameworks provide comparable options. While these methods are common practice and usually work well, they also have several disadvantages such as limited flexibility, additional source code overhead, poor usability, or a potentially strong negative impact on the effectiveness of automatic model optimization procedures. In this paper, an alternative way to formulate surrogate gradients is presented, namely, forward gradient injection (FGI). FGI applies a simple but effective combination of basic standard operations to inject an arbitrary gradient shape into the computational graph directly within the forward pass. It is demonstrated that using FGI is straightforward and convenient. Moreover, it is shown that FGI can significantly increase the model performance in comparison to custom backward methods in SNNs when using TorchScript. These results are complemented with a general performance study on recurrent SNNs with TorchScript and torch.compile, revealing the potential for a training speedup of more than 7x and an inference speedup of more than 16x in comparison with pure PyTorch.">

        <tr id="Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have been shown to have limitations in terms of expressivity and modeling long-range interactions. Augmenting MPNNs with a virtual node (VN) removes the locality constraint of the layer aggregation and has been found to improve performance on a range of benchmarks. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the role of VNs and benefits thereof, through the lenses of oversmoothing, oversquashing, and sensitivity analysis. First, in contrast to prior belief, we find that VNs typically avoid replicating anti-smoothing approaches to maintain expressive power. Second, we characterize, precisely, how the improvement afforded by VNs on the mixing abilities of the network and hence in mitigating oversquashing, depends on the underlying topology. Finally, we highlight that, unlike Graph-Transformers (GT), classical instantiations of the VN are often constrained to assign uniform importance to different nodes. Consequently, we propose a variant of VN with the same computational complexity, which can have different sensitivity to nodes based on the graph structure. We show that this is an extremely effective and computationally efficient baseline on graph-level tasks.">

Neural operators are neural networks that learn a mapping from the parameter space to the solution space of PDEs from data, and they can also solve the inverse problem of estimating the parameter from the solution. Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

        <tr id="Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) extends traditional variational families with semi-implicit distributions defined in a hierarchical manner. Due to the intractable densities of semi-implicit distributions, classical SIVI often resorts to surrogates of evidence lower bound (ELBO) that would introduce biases for training. A recent advancement in SIVI, named SIVI-SM, utilizes an alternative score matching objective made tractable via a minimax formulation, albeit requiring an additional lower-level optimization. In this paper, we propose kernel SIVI (KSIVI), a variant of SIVI-SM that eliminates the need for lower-level optimization through kernel tricks. Specifically, we show that when optimizing over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), the lower-level problem has an explicit solution. This way, the upper-level objective becomes the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which is readily computable for stochastic gradient descent due to the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit variational distributions. An upper bound for the variance of the Monte Carlo gradient estimators of the KSD objective is derived, which allows us to establish novel convergence guarantees of KSIVI. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of KSIVI on both synthetic distributions and a variety of real data Bayesian inference tasks.">

When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations.

However, most progress has focused on proving identifiability results in different settings, and we are not aware of any successful real-world application. At the same time, the field of dynamical systems benefited from deep learning and scaled to countless applications but does not allow parameter identification. In this paper, we draw a clear connection between the two and their key assumptions, allowing us to apply identifiable methods developed in causal representation learning to dynamical systems. At the same time, we can leverage scalable differentiable solvers developed for differential equations to build models that are both identifiable and practical. Overall, we learn explicitly controllable models that isolate the trajectory-specific parameters for further downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution classification or treatment effect estimation. We experiment with a wind simulator with partially known factors of variation. We also apply the resulting model to real-world climate data and successfully answer downstream causal questions in line with existing literature on climate change.">

GGN has been found particularly interesting for practical training of deep neural networks, not only for its impressive convergence speed, but also for its close relation with neural tangent kernel regression, which is central to recent studies that aim to understand the optimization and generalization properties of neural networks. This work studies a GGN method for optimizing a two-layer neural network with explicit regularization. In particular, we consider a class of generalized self-concordant (GSC) functions that provide smooth approximations to commonly-used penalty terms in the objective function of the optimization problem. This approach provides an adaptive learning rate selection technique that requires little to no tuning for optimal performance. We study the convergence of the two-layer neural network, considered to be overparameterized, in the optimization loop of the resulting GGN method for a given scaling of the network parameters. Our numerical experiments highlight specific aspects of GSC regularization that help to improve generalization of the optimized neural network.

 This paper introduces gradient-based adaptive neural networks to solve local fractional elliptic partial differential equations. The impact of physics-informed neural networks helps to approximate elliptic partial differential equations governed by the physical process. The proposed technique employs learning the behaviour of complex systems based on input-output data, and automatic differentiation ensures accurate computation of gradient. The method computes the singularity-embedded local fractional partial derivative model on a Hausdorff metric, which otherwise halts the computation by available approximating numerical methods. This is possible because the new network is capable of updating the weight associated with loss terms depending on the solution domain and requirement of solution behaviour. The semi-positive definite character of the neural tangent kernel achieves the convergence of gradient-based adaptive neural networks. The importance of hyperparameters, namely the number of neurons and the learning rate, is shown by considering a stationary anomalous diffusion-convection model on a rectangular domain. The proposed method showcases the network’s ability to approximate solutions of various local fractional elliptic partial differential equations with varying fractal parameters.">

However, despite their user-friendly interface and broad applicability, PINNs encounter challenges in accurately resolving PDEs, especially when dealing with singular cases that may lead to unsatisfactory local minima. To address these challenges and improve solution accuracy, we propose an innovative approach called Annealed Adaptive Importance Sampling (AAIS) for computing the discretized PDE residuals of the cost functions, inspired by the Expectation Maximization algorithm used in finite mixtures to mimic target density. Our objective is to approximate discretized PDE residuals by strategically sampling additional points in regions with elevated residuals, thus enhancing the effectiveness and accuracy of PINNs. Implemented together with a straightforward resampling strategy within PINNs, our AAIS algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency across a range of tested PDEs, even with limited training datasets. Moreover, our proposed AAIS-PINN method shows promising capabilities in solving high-dimensional singular PDEs. The adaptive sampling framework introduced here can be integrated into various PINN frameworks.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modelling and scientific machine learning have been responsible for significant advances in determining suitable models to describe data. Within dynamical systems, neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where the system equations are set to be governed by a neural network, have become a popular tool for this challenge in recent years. However, less emphasis has been placed on systems that are only partially-observed. In this work, we employ a hybrid neural ODE structure, where the system equations are governed by a combination of a neural network and domain-specific knowledge, together with symbolic regression (SR), to learn governing equations of partially-observed dynamical systems. We test this approach on two case studies: A 3-dimensional model of the Lotka-Volterra system and a 5-dimensional model of the Lorenz system. We demonstrate that the method is capable of successfully learning the true underlying governing equations of unobserved states within these systems, with robustness to measurement noise.">

In climate science, analogs in historical and climate projection data are used for attribution and impact studies. However, most of the time, those large weather and climate datasets are nearline. They must be downloaded, which takes a lot of bandwidth and disk space, before the computationally expensive search can be executed. We propose a dimension reduction technique based on autoencoder (AE) neural networks to compress those datasets and perform the search in an interpretable, compressed latent space. A distance-regularized Siamese twin autoencoder (DIRESA) architecture is designed to preserve distance in latent space while capturing the nonlinearities in the datasets. Using conceptual climate models of different complexities, we show that the latent components thus obtained provide physical insight into the dominant modes of variability in the system. Compressing datasets with DIRESA reduces the online storage and keeps the latent components uncorrelated, while the distance (ordering) preservation and reconstruction fidelity robustly outperform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other dimension reduction techniques such as UMAP or variational autoencoders.">

Variational approaches that penalize time derivatives or introduce motion model regularizers have been proposed to relate subsequent frames and improve image quality using grid-based discretization. Neural fields offer an alternative parametrization of the desired spatiotemporal quantity with a deep neural network, a lightweight, continuous, and biased towards smoothness representation. The inductive bias has been exploited to enforce time regularity for dynamic inverse problems resulting in neural fields optimized by minimizing a data-fidelity term only. In this paper we investigate and show the benefits of introducing explicit PDE-based motion regularizers, namely, the optical flow equation, in 2D+time computed tomography for the optimization of neural fields. We also compare neural fields against a grid-based solver and show that the former outperforms the latter.">

Our approach is based on local coordinate frames, between which geometric information is communicated consistently by including tensorial objects in the messages. Our framework can be applied to message passing on geometric data in arbitrary dimensional Euclidean space. While many other approaches for equivariant message passing require specialized building blocks, such as non-standard normalization layers or non-linearities, our approach can be adapted straightforwardly to any existing architecture without such modifications.

We show that the high-dimensional Markov operator can be obtained under a functional hierarchical tensor (FHT) ansatz with a hierarchical sketching algorithm. When the terminal condition admits an FHT ansatz, the proposed operator outputs an FHT ansatz for the PDE solution through an efficient functional tensor network contraction procedure. In addition, the proposed operator-based approach also provides an efficient way to solve the Kolmogorov forward equation when the initial distribution is in an FHT ansatz.

However, at low temperature, when directly solving a stationary Fokker-Planck equation with more than two metastable states in the generalized potential landscape, the small eigenvalue introduces numerical difficulties due to a large condition number. To overcome these problems, we introduce the IGANN method, which uses a penalty of negative input gradient annealing during the training.

One advantage of the neural network method for PDEs lies in its automatic differentiation (AD), which necessitates only the sample points themselves, unlike traditional finite difference (FD) approximations that require nearby local points to compute derivatives. In this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of AD in training neural networks. The concept of truncated entropy is introduced to characterize the training property. Specifically, through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses conducted on random feature models and two-layer neural networks, we discover that the defined truncated entropy serves as a reliable metric for quantifying the residual loss of random feature models and the training speed of neural networks for both AD and FD methods. Our experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that, from a training perspective, AD outperforms FD in solving partial differential equations.">

Machine learning techniques are a relatively recent method for solving PDEs. Despite the increasing number of machine learning strategies developed to approximate PDEs, many remain focused on relatively small domains. When scaling the equations, a large domain is naturally obtained, especially when the solution exhibits multiscale characteristics. This study examines two-scale equations whose solution structures exhibit distinct characteristics: highly localized in some regions and significantly flat in others. These two regions must be adequately addressed over a large domain to approximate the solution more accurately. We focus on the vanishing gradient problem given by the diminishing gradient zone of the activation function over large domains and propose a stratified sampling algorithm to address this problem. We compare the uniform random classical sampling method over the entire domain and the proposed stratified sampling method. The numerical results confirm that the proposed method yields more accurate and consistent solutions than classical methods.">

        <tr id="Hyperbolic deep learning has become a growing research direction in computer vision for the unique properties afforded by the alternate embedding space. The negative curvature and exponentially growing distance metric provide a natural framework for capturing hierarchical relationships between datapoints and allowing for finer separability between their embeddings. However, these methods are still computationally expensive and prone to instability, especially when attempting to learn the negative curvature that best suits the task and the data. Current Riemannian optimizers do not account for changes in the manifold which greatly harms performance and forces lower learning rates to minimize projection errors. Our paper focuses on curvature learning by introducing an improved schema for popular learning algorithms and providing a novel normalization approach to constrain embeddings within the variable representative radius of the manifold. Additionally, we introduce a novel formulation for Riemannian AdamW, and alternative hybrid encoder techniques and foundational formulations for current convolutional hyperbolic operations, greatly reducing the computational penalty of the hyperbolic embedding space. Our approach demonstrates consistent performance improvements across both direct classification and hierarchical metric learning tasks while allowing for larger hyperbolic models.">

        <tr id="We propose an algebraic geometric framework to study the expressivity of linear activation neural networks. A particular quantity that has been actively studied in the field of deep learning is the number of linear regions, which gives an estimate of the information capacity of the architecture. To study and evaluate information capacity and expressivity, we work in the setting of tropical geometry -- a combinatorial and polyhedral variant of algebraic geometry -- where there are known connections between tropical rational maps and feedforward neural networks. Our work builds on and expands this connection to capitalize on the rich theory of tropical geometry to characterize and study various architectural aspects of neural networks. Our contributions are threefold: we provide a novel tropical geometric approach to selecting sampling domains among linear regions; an algebraic result allowing for a guided restriction of the sampling domain for network architectures with symmetries; and an open source library to analyze neural networks as tropical Puiseux rational maps. We provide a comprehensive set of proof-of-concept numerical experiments demonstrating the breadth of neural network architectures to which tropical geometric theory can be applied to reveal insights on expressivity characteristics of a network. Our work provides the foundations for the adaptation of both theory and existing software from computational tropical geometry and symbolic computation to deep learning.">

This framework is then used to build a novel finite neuron method to solve the 2nd order elliptic equations with the Dirichlet boundary condition. Our algorithm is the first algorithm, proven to lead to shallow neural network solutions with an optimal H1 norm error. We show that a widely used penalized PDE, which imposes the Dirichlet boundary condition weakly can be interpreted as the first element of the sequence of PDEs within our framework. Furthermore, numerically, we show that it may not lead to the solution with the optimal H1 norm error bound in general. On the other hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the second and later elements of a sequence of PDEs can lead to an adequate solution with the optimal H1 norm error bound.

While some theoretical explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon in specific contexts, an accepted theory for its occurring mechanism in deep learning remains yet to be established. In this study, we revisited the phenomenon of double descent and discussed the conditions of its occurrence. This paper introduces the concept of class-activation matrices and a methodology for estimating the effective complexity of functions, on which we unveil that over-parameterized models exhibit more distinct and simpler class patterns in hidden activations compared to under-parameterized ones. We further looked into the interpolation of noisy labelled data among clean representations and demonstrated overfitting w.r.t. expressive capacity. By comprehensively analysing hypotheses and presenting corresponding empirical evidence that either validates or contradicts these hypotheses, we aim to provide fresh insights into the phenomenon of double descent and benign over-parameterization and facilitate future explorations. By comprehensively studying different hypotheses and the corresponding empirical evidence either supports or challenges these hypotheses, our goal is to offer new insights into the phenomena of double descent and benign over-parameterization, thereby enabling further explorations in the field.

To address this challenge, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach together with Graph Neural Network. We thus propose Neural Bond Graph Encoder (NBgE), a model agnostic physical-informed encoder tailored for multi-physics systems.

        <tr id="Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.">

Such networks have a variety of hallmark properties: the outputs depend on the inputs via compressive nonlinearities such as cubic roots, and both the timescales of relaxation and the length-scales of signal propagation depend sensitively on the inputs as power laws, both diverging as the input to 0. The basic dynamical mechanism is that inputs to the network generate ongoing activity, which in turn controls how additional inputs or signals propagate spatially or attenuate in time. We present analytical solutions for the steady states when the network is forced with a single oscillation and when a background value creates a steady state of ongoing activity, and derive the relationships shaping the value of the temporal decay and spatial propagation length as a function of this background value.">

A revelation of our work is the observed convergence of neural network dynamics towards conventional theory even with standardized GM inputs, highlighting an unexpected universality. We found that standardization, especially in conjunction with certain nonlinear functions, plays a critical role in this phenomena. Consequently, despite the complex and varied nature of GM distributions, we demonstrate that neural networks exhibit asymptotic behaviors in line with predictions under simple Gaussian frameworks.">

However, the quality of a neural network highly depends on the used training data. Noisy, insufficient, or biased training data leads to suboptimal results. We present a hybrid method that combines deep learning with iterated graph Laplacian and show its application in acoustic impedance inversion which is a routine procedure in seismic explorations. A neural network is used to obtain a first approximation of the underlying acoustic impedance and construct a graph Laplacian matrix from this approximation. Afterwards, we use a Tikhonov-like variational method to solve the impedance inversion problem where the regularizer is based on the constructed graph Laplacian. The obtained solution can be shown to be more accurate and stable with respect to noise than the initial guess obtained by the neural network. This process can be iterated several times, each time constructing a new graph Laplacian matrix from the most recent reconstruction. The method converges after only a few iterations returning a much more accurate reconstruction. We demonstrate the potential of our method on two different datasets and under various levels of noise. We use two different neural networks that have been introduced in previous works. The experiments show that our approach improves the reconstruction quality in the presence of noise.">

Our novel conceptual framework provides an exact reduction of the task of learning the denoising Markov chain to solving a class of binary classification tasks. More specifically, the model learns to classify a given token in a noisy sequence as signal or noise. In contrast, prior works on discrete diffusion models either solve regression problems to learn importance ratios, or minimize loss functions given by variational approximations. We apply GGM to language modeling and image generation, where images are discretized using image tokenizers like VQGANs. We show that it outperforms existing discrete diffusion models in language generation, and demonstrates strong performance for image generation without using dataset-specific image tokenizers. We also show that our model is capable of performing well in zero-shot control settings like text and image infilling.">

        <tr id="Convergence rate analysis for general state-space Markov chains is fundamentally important in areas such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and algorithmic analysis (for computing explicit convergence bounds). This problem, however, is notoriously difficult because traditional analytical methods often do not generate practically useful convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains. We propose the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), the first general-purpose sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence of Markov chains to stationarity in Wasserstein distance. The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in (Qu et.al, 2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.">

        <tr id="Motivated by applications to deep learning which often fail standard Lipschitz smoothness requirements, we examine the problem of sampling from distributions that are not log-concave and are only weakly dissipative, with log-gradients allowed to grow superlinearly at infinity. In terms of structure, we only assume that the target distribution satisfies either a log-Sobolev or a Poincar\'e inequality and a local Lipschitz smoothness assumption with modulus growing possibly polynomially at infinity. This set of assumptions greatly exceeds the operational limits of the"vanilla"unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), making sampling from such distributions a highly involved affair. To account for this, we introduce a taming scheme which is tailored to the growth and decay properties of the target distribution, and we provide explicit non-asymptotic guarantees for the proposed sampler in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, total variation, and Wasserstein distance to the target distribution.">

        <tr id="Learning from complex, multidimensional data has become central to computational mathematics, and among the most successful high-dimensional function approximators are deep neural networks (DNNs). Training DNNs is posed as an optimization problem to learn network weights or parameters that well-approximate a mapping from input to target data. Multiway data or tensors arise naturally in myriad ways in deep learning, in particular as input data and as high-dimensional weights and features extracted by the network, with the latter often being a bottleneck in terms of speed and memory. In this work, we leverage tensor representations and processing to efficiently parameterize DNNs when learning from high-dimensional data. We propose tensor neural networks (t-NNs), a natural extension of traditional fully-connected networks, that can be trained efficiently in a reduced, yet more powerful parameter space. Our t-NNs are built upon matrix-mimetic tensor-tensor products, which retain algebraic properties of matrix multiplication while capturing high-dimensional correlations. Mimeticity enables t-NNs to inherit desirable properties of modern DNN architectures. We exemplify this by extending recent work on stable neural networks, which interpret DNNs as discretizations of differential equations, to our multidimensional framework. We provide empirical evidence of the parametric advantages of t-NNs on dimensionality reduction using autoencoders and classification using fully-connected and stable variants on benchmark imaging datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10.">

        <tr id="Diffusion-based representation learning has achieved substantial attention due to its promising capabilities in latent representation and sample generation. Recent studies have employed an auxiliary encoder to identify a corresponding representation from a sample and to adjust the dimensionality of a latent variable z. Meanwhile, this auxiliary structure invokes information split problem because the diffusion and the auxiliary encoder would divide the information from the sample into two representations for each model. Particularly, the information modeled by the diffusion becomes over-regularized because of the static prior distribution on xT. To address this problem, we introduce Diffusion Bridge AuteEncoders (DBAE), which enable z-dependent endpoint xT inference through a feed-forward architecture. This structure creates an information bottleneck at z, so xT becomes dependent on z in its generation. This results in two consequences: 1) z holds the full information of samples, and 2) xT becomes a learnable distribution, not static any further. We propose an objective function for DBAE to enable both reconstruction and generative modeling, with their theoretical justification. Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of the intended design in DBAE, which notably enhances downstream inference quality, reconstruction, and disentanglement. Additionally, DBAE generates high-fidelity samples in the unconditional generation.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models have become a successful approach for solving various image inverse problems by providing a powerful diffusion prior. Many studies tried to combine the measurement into diffusion by score function replacement, matrix decomposition, or optimization algorithms, but it is hard to balance the data consistency and realness. The slow sampling speed is also a main obstacle to its wide application. To address the challenges, we propose Deep Data Consistency (DDC) to update the data consistency step with a deep learning model when solving inverse problems with diffusion models. By analyzing existing methods, the variational bound training objective is used to maximize the conditional posterior and reduce its impact on the diffusion process. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods in linear and non-linear tasks, DDC demonstrates its outstanding performance of both similarity and realness metrics in generating high-quality solutions with only 5 inference steps in 0.77 seconds on average. In addition, the robustness of DDC is well illustrated in the experiments across datasets, with large noise and the capacity to solve multiple tasks in only one pre-trained model.">

        <tr id="The discretization of the deep Ritz method [18] for the Poisson equation leads to a high-dimensional non-convex minimization problem, that is difficult and expensive to solve numerically. In this paper, we consider the shallow Ritz approximation to one-dimensional diffusion problems and introduce an effective and efficient iterative method, a damped block Newton (dBN) method, for solving the resulting non-convex minimization problem. The method employs the block Gauss-Seidel method as an outer iteration by dividing the parameters of a shallow neural network into the linear parameters (the weights and bias of the output layer) and the non-linear parameters (the weights and bias of the hidden layer). Per each outer iteration, the linear and the non-linear parameters are updated by exact inversion and one step of a damped Newton method, respectively. Inverses of the coefficient matrix and the Hessian matrix are tridiagonal and diagonal, respectively, and hence the cost of each dBN iteration is $\mathcal{O}(n)$. To move the breakpoints (the non-linear parameters) more efficiently, we propose an adaptive damped block Newton (AdBN) method by combining the dBN with the adaptive neuron enhancement (ANE) method [25]. Numerical examples demonstrate the ability of dBN and AdBN not only to move the breakpoints quickly and efficiently but also to achieve a nearly optimal order of convergence for AdBN. These iterative solvers are capable of outperforming BFGS for select examples.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators in vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in downstream tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper studies amortized sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free learning objective, relative trajectory balance, for training a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning.">

In principle, both space and time of the processes can be discrete or continuous. In this work, we study time-continuous Markov jump processes on discrete state spaces and investigate their correspondence to state-continuous diffusion processes given by SDEs. In particular, we revisit the $\textit{Ehrenfest process}$, which converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the infinite state space limit. Likewise, we can show that the time-reversal of the Ehrenfest process converges to the time-reversed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This observation bridges discrete and continuous state spaces and allows to carry over methods from one to the respective other setting. Additionally, we suggest an algorithm for training the time-reversal of Markov jump processes which relies on conditional expectations and can thus be directly related to denoising score matching. We demonstrate our methods in multiple convincing numerical experiments.">

Despite tremendous efforts, a neural network architecture with the ability to high-accurately solve these fully connected and extremely intractable problems on larger systems is still lacking. Here we propose a variational autoregressive architecture with a message passing mechanism, which can effectively utilize the interactions between spin variables. The new network trained under an annealing framework outperforms existing methods in solving several prototypical Ising spin Hamiltonians, especially for larger spin systems at low temperatures. The advantages also come from the great mitigation of mode collapse during the training process of deep neural networks.

This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries.

In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries.

        <tr id="Time-dependent flow fields are typically generated by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, which is an extremely time-consuming process. However, the latent relationship between the flow fields is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations and can be described by an operator. We therefore train a deep operator network, or simply DeepONet, to learn the temporal evolution between flow snapshots. Once properly trained, given a few consecutive snapshots as input, the network has a great potential to generate the next snapshot accurately and quickly. Using the output as a new input, the network iterates the process, generating a series of successive snapshots with little wall time. Specifically, we consider 2D flow around a circular cylinder at Reynolds number 1000, and prepare a set of high-fidelity data using a high-order spectral/hp element method as ground truth. Although the flow fields are periodic, there are many small-scale features in the wake flow that are difficult to generate accurately. Furthermore, any discrepancy between the prediction and the ground truth for the first snapshots can easily accumulate during the iterative process, which eventually amplifies the overall deviations. Therefore, we propose two alternative techniques to improve the training of DeepONet. The first one enhances the feature extraction of the network by harnessing the"multi-head non-local block". The second one refines the network parameters by leveraging the local smooth optimization technique. Both techniques prove to be highly effective in reducing the cumulative errors and our results outperform those of the dynamic mode decomposition method.">

        <tr id="Bayesian neural network posterior distributions have a great number of modes that correspond to the same network function. The abundance of such modes can make it difficult for approximate inference methods to do their job. Recent work has demonstrated the benefits of partial stochasticity for approximate inference in Bayesian neural networks; inference can be less costly and performance can sometimes be improved. I propose a structured way to select the deterministic subset of weights that removes neuron permutation symmetries, and therefore the corresponding redundant posterior modes. With a drastically simplified posterior distribution, the performance of existing approximate inference schemes is found to be greatly improved.">

In particular, we focus on the case of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, with several choices of the coupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. This type of calculation introduces a number of challenges with respect to the case of General Relativity, mainly due to the extra complexity of the perturbation equations and to the fact that the background solution is known only numerically. The solution of these perturbation equations typically requires sophisticated numerical techniques that are not easy to develop in computational codes. We show that physics-informed neural networks have an accuracy which is comparable to traditional numerical methods in the case of numerical backgrounds, while being very simple to implement. Additionally, the use of GPU parallelization is straightforward thanks to the use of standard machine learning environments.">

        <tr id="Recently, a vast amount of literature has focused on the"Neural Collapse"(NC) phenomenon, which emerges when training neural network (NN) classifiers beyond the zero training error point. The core component of NC is the decrease in the within class variability of the network's deepest features, dubbed as NC1. The theoretical works that study NC are typically based on simplified unconstrained features models (UFMs) that mask any effect of the data on the extent of collapse. In this paper, we provide a kernel-based analysis that does not suffer from this limitation. First, given a kernel function, we establish expressions for the traces of the within- and between-class covariance matrices of the samples' features (and consequently an NC1 metric). Then, we turn to focus on kernels associated with shallow NNs. First, we consider the NN Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP), associated with the network at initialization, and the complement Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), associated with its training in the"lazy regime". Interestingly, we show that the NTK does not represent more collapsed features than the NNGP for prototypical data models. As NC emerges from training, we then consider an alternative to NTK: the recently proposed adaptive kernel, which generalizes NNGP to model the feature mapping learned from the training data. Contrasting our NC1 analysis for these two kernels enables gaining insights into the effect of data distribution on the extent of collapse, which are empirically aligned with the behavior observed with practical training of NNs.">

We address both challenges with a unified framework that incorporates a clustering inductive bias into the message passing mechanism, using additional cluster-nodes. Central to our approach is the formulation of an optimal transport based implicit clustering objective function. However, the algorithm for solving the implicit objective function needs to be differentiable to enable end-to-end learning of the GNN. To facilitate this, we adopt an entropy regularized objective function and propose an iterative optimization process, alternating between solving for the cluster assignments and updating the node/cluster-node embeddings. Notably, our derived closed-form optimization steps are themselves simple yet elegant message passing steps operating seamlessly on a bipartite graph of nodes and cluster-nodes. Our clustering-based approach can effectively capture both local and global information, demonstrated by extensive experiments on both heterophilous and homophilous datasets.">

We detail a number of problem-specific classical and quantum architecture choices used to achieve this result. Subsequently, we introduce the barotropic vorticity equation (BVE) as our model of the atmosphere, which is a $3^{\text{rd}}$ order partial differential equation (PDE) in its stream function formulation. Using the differentiable quantum circuits algorithm, we successfully solve the BVE under appropriate boundary conditions and use the trained model to predict unseen future dynamics to high accuracy given an artificial initial weather state. Whilst challenges remain, our results mark an advancement in terms of the complexity of PDEs solved with quantum scientific machine learning.">

In this work, we propose a data-driven, non-intrusive method that utilizes stochastic variational deep kernel learning (SVDKL) to discover low-dimensional latent spaces from data and a recurrent version of SVDKL for representing and predicting the evolution of latent dynamics. The proposed method is demonstrated with two challenging examples -- a double pendulum and a reaction-diffusion system.

        <tr id="A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA). In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems. The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible. Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy. This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills. With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty. Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems. Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.">

This constructs a near-minimal network while allowing the model to expand its capacity when cannot sufficiently hold new classes. At inference time, it automatically reactivates the required neural units to retrieve knowledge and leaves the remaining inactivated to prevent interference. We name our model AutoActivator, which is effective and scalable. To gain insights into the neural unit dynamics, we theoretically analyze the model's convergence property via a universal approximation theorem on learning sequential mappings, which is under-explored in the CIL community.

        <tr id="Pretrained diffusion models (DMs) have recently been popularly used in solving inverse problems (IPs). The existing methods mostly interleave iterative steps in the reverse diffusion process and iterative steps to bring the iterates closer to satisfying the measurement constraint. However, such interleaving methods struggle to produce final results that look like natural objects of interest (i.e., manifold feasibility) and fit the measurement (i.e., measurement feasibility), especially for nonlinear IPs. Moreover, their capabilities to deal with noisy IPs with unknown types and levels of measurement noise are unknown. In this paper, we advocate viewing the reverse process in DMs as a function and propose a novel plug-in method for solving IPs using pretrained DMs, dubbed DMPlug. DMPlug addresses the issues of manifold feasibility and measurement feasibility in a principled manner, and also shows great potential for being robust to unknown types and levels of noise. Through extensive experiments across various IP tasks, including two linear and three nonlinear IPs, we demonstrate that DMPlug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins especially for nonlinear IPs.

        <tr id="Symbolic Regression (SR) is a widely studied field of research that aims to infer symbolic expressions from data. A popular approach for SR is the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (\sindy) framework, which uses sparse regression to identify governing equations from data. This study introduces an enhanced method, Nested SINDy, that aims to increase the expressivity of the SINDy approach thanks to a nested structure. Indeed, traditional symbolic regression and system identification methods often fail with complex systems that cannot be easily described analytically. Nested SINDy builds on the SINDy framework by introducing additional layers before and after the core SINDy layer. This allows the method to identify symbolic representations for a wider range of systems, including those with compositions and products of functions. We demonstrate the ability of the Nested SINDy approach to accurately find symbolic expressions for simple systems, such as basic trigonometric functions, and sparse (false but accurate) analytical representations for more complex systems. Our results highlight Nested SINDy's potential as a tool for symbolic regression, surpassing the traditional SINDy approach in terms of expressivity. However, we also note the challenges in the optimization process for Nested SINDy and suggest future research directions, including the designing of a more robust methodology for the optimization process. This study proves that Nested SINDy can effectively discover symbolic representations of dynamical systems from data, offering new opportunities for understanding complex systems through data-driven methods.">

Specifically, we formulate a consistent diffusion process in the robot action space conditioned on the point cloud input, where the original action is required to be directly denoised from any point along the ODE trajectory. To model this process, we design a consistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly instead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast convergence in the low-dimensional action manifold. We evaluate ManiCM on 31 robotic manipulation tasks from Adroit and Metaworld, and the results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the state-of-the-art method by 10 times in average inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rate.">

In such systems, patterns emerge from (local) interactions among self-propelled entities. While several well-understood governing equations for motion and interaction exist, they are difficult to fit to data due to the often large number of entities and missing correspondences between the observation times, which may also not be equidistant. To evade such confounding factors, we investigate collective behavior from a \textit{topological perspective}, but instead of summarizing entire observation sequences (as in prior work), we propose learning a latent dynamical model from topological features \textit{per time point}. The latter is then used to formulate a downstream regression task to predict the parametrization of some a priori specified governing equation. We implement this idea based on a latent ODE learned from vectorized (static) persistence diagrams and show that this modeling choice is justified by a combination of recent stability results for persistent homology. Various (ablation) experiments not only demonstrate the relevance of each individual model component, but provide compelling empirical evidence that our proposed model -- \textit{neural persistence dynamics} -- substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art across a diverse set of parameter regression tasks.">

Here, we present a novel deep learning framework to estimate the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds.

        <tr id="Discrepancy is a well-known measure for the irregularity of the distribution of a point set. Point sets with small discrepancy are called low-discrepancy and are known to efficiently fill the space in a uniform manner. Low-discrepancy points play a central role in many problems in science and engineering, including numerical integration, computer vision, machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation. In this work, we present the first machine learning approach to generate a new class of low-discrepancy point sets named Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) points. Motivated by the geometric nature of generating low-discrepancy point sets, we leverage tools from Geometric Deep Learning and base our model on Graph Neural Networks. We further provide an extension of our framework to higher dimensions, which flexibly allows the generation of custom-made points that emphasize the uniformity in specific dimensions that are primarily important for the particular problem at hand. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance superior to previous methods by a significant margin. In fact, MPMC points are empirically shown to be either optimal or near-optimal with respect to the discrepancy for every dimension and the number of points for which the optimal discrepancy can be determined.">

This paper employs a greedy sampling approach based on the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method to identify the most informative samples in a dataset associated with a partial differential equation to estimate its parameters. Greedy samples are used to train a physics-informed neural network architecture which maps the nonlinear relation between spatio-temporal data and the measured values. To prove the impact of greedy samples on the training of the physics-informed neural network for parameter estimation of a partial differential equation, their performance is compared with random samples taken from the given dataset. Our simulation results show that for all considered partial differential equations, greedy samples outperform random samples, i.e., we can estimate parameters with a significantly lower number of samples while simultaneously reducing the relative estimation error. A Python package is also prepared to support different phases of the proposed algorithm, including data prepossessing, greedy sampling, neural network training, and comparison.">

Therefore, we derive equations for the tangent operator of the learning dynamics of three-layer networks learning regression tasks. The results are valid for an arbitrary numbers of nodes and arbitrary choices of activation functions. Applying the results to a network learning a regression task, we investigate numerically, how stability indicators relate to the final training-loss.

        <tr id="Molecular relaxation, finding the equilibrium state of a non-equilibrium structure, is an essential component of computational chemistry to understand reactivity. Classical force field methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network force field models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface instead of the complex physical potential energy surface. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical force fields, equivariant neural network force fields trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their DFT energies.">

        <tr id="We consider the problem of making nonparametric inference in multi-dimensional diffusion models from low-frequency data. Statistical analysis in this setting is notoriously challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood and its gradient, and computational methods have thus far largely resorted to expensive simulation-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new computational approach which is motivated by PDE theory and is built around the characterisation of the transition densities as solutions of the associated heat (Fokker-Planck) equation. Employing optimal regularity results from the theory of parabolic PDEs, we prove a novel characterisation for the gradient of the likelihood. Using these developments, for the nonlinear inverse problem of recovering the diffusivity (in divergence form models), we then show that the numerical evaluation of the likelihood and its gradient can be reduced to standard elliptic eigenvalue problems, solvable by powerful finite element methods. This enables the efficient implementation of a large class of statistical algorithms, including (i) preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and Langevin-type methods for posterior sampling, and (ii) gradient-based descent optimisation schemes to compute maximum likelihood and maximum-a-posteriori estimates. We showcase the effectiveness of these methods via extensive simulation studies in a nonparametric Bayesian model with Gaussian process priors. Interestingly, the optimisation schemes provided satisfactory numerical recovery while exhibiting rapid convergence towards stationary points despite the problem nonlinearity; thus our approach may lead to significant computational speed-ups.

We present an extension to the ARGOS framework, ARGOS-RAL, which leverages sparse regression with the recurrent adaptive lasso to identify PDEs from limited prior knowledge automatically. Our method automates calculating partial derivatives, constructing a candidate library, and estimating a sparse model. We rigorously evaluate the performance of ARGOS-RAL in identifying canonical PDEs under various noise levels and sample sizes, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy and non-uniformly distributed data. We also test the algorithm's performance on datasets consisting solely of random noise to simulate scenarios with severely compromised data quality. Our results show that ARGOS-RAL effectively and reliably identifies the underlying PDEs from data, outperforming the sequential threshold ridge regression method in most cases. We highlight the potential of combining statistical methods, machine learning, and dynamical systems theory to automatically discover governing equations from collected data, streamlining the scientific modeling process.">

This 'better with more' phenomenon enables the effectiveness of large-scale pre-training on vast amounts of data. However, current graph pre-training methods struggle to scale up data due to heterogeneity across graphs. To achieve effective data scaling, we aim to develop a general model that is able to capture diverse data patterns of graphs and can be utilized to adaptively help the downstream tasks. To this end, we propose UniAug, a universal graph structure augmentor built on a diffusion model. We first pre-train a discrete diffusion model on thousands of graphs across domains to learn the graph structural patterns. In the downstream phase, we provide adaptive enhancement by conducting graph structure augmentation with the help of the pre-trained diffusion model via guided generation. By leveraging the pre-trained diffusion model for structure augmentation, we consistently achieve performance improvements across various downstream tasks in a plug-and-play manner. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first demonstration of a data-scaling graph structure augmentor on graphs across domains.">

In this paper we consider a number of strategies for selecting these points and investigate their impact on the overall accuracy of the method. In particular, we suggest that no single approach is likely to be ``optimal'' but we show how a number of important metrics can have an impact in improving the quality of the results obtained when using a fixed number of residual evaluations.

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) of different types, including fractional PDEs (fPDES) [29]. Herein, we propose a new general (quasi) Monte Carlo PINN for solving fPDEs on irregular domains. Specifically, instead of approximating fractional derivatives by Monte Carlo approximations of integrals as was done previously in [31], we use a more general Monte Carlo approximation method to solve different fPDEs, which is valid for fractional differentiation under any definition. Moreover, based on the ensemble probability density function, the generated nodes are all located in denser regions near the target point where we perform the differentiation. This has an unexpected connection with known finite difference methods on non-equidistant or nested grids, and hence our method inherits their advantages. At the same time, the generated nodes exhibit a block-like dense distribution, leading to a good computational efficiency of this approach. We present the framework for using this algorithm and apply it to several examples. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC-PINNs in dealing with irregular domain problems and show a higher computational efficiency compared to the original fPINN method. We also include comparisons with the Monte Carlo fPINN [31]. Finally, we use examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in dealing with fuzzy boundary location problems, and then use the method to solve the coupled 3D fractional Bloch-Torrey equation defined in the ventricular domain of the human brain, and compare the results with classical numerical methods.">

Despite their success, traditional VAEs rely on continuous latent variables, which deviates sharply from the discrete nature of biological neurons. Here, we developed the Poisson VAE (P-VAE), a novel architecture that combines principles of predictive coding with a VAE that encodes inputs into discrete spike counts. Combining Poisson-distributed latent variables with predictive coding introduces a metabolic cost term in the model loss function, suggesting a relationship with sparse coding which we verify empirically. Additionally, we analyze the geometry of learned representations, contrasting the P-VAE to alternative VAE models. We find that the P-VAEencodes its inputs in relatively higher dimensions, facilitating linear separability of categories in a downstream classification task with a much better (5x) sample efficiency. Our work provides an interpretable computational framework to study brain-like sensory processing and paves the way for a deeper understanding of perception as an inferential process.">

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate physical principles-typically mathematical models expressed as differential equations-into the machine learning (ML) processes to guarantee the physical validity of ML model solutions. This approach has gained traction in science and engineering for modeling a wide range of physical phenomena. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of PINNs in solving nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), is found challenging due to discontinuities inherent in such PDE solutions. While previous research has focused on advancing training algorithms, our study highlights that encoding precise physical laws into PINN framework suffices to address the challenge. By coupling well-constructed governing equations into the most basic, simply structured PINNs, this research tackles both data-independent solution and data-driven discovery of the Buckley-Leverett equation, a typical hyperbolic PDE central to modeling multi-phase fluid flow in porous media. Our results reveal that vanilla PINNs are adequate to solve the Buckley-Leverett equation with superior precision and even handling more complex scenarios including variations in fluid mobility ratios, the addition of a gravity term to the original governing equation, and the presence of multiple discontinuities in the solution. This capability of PINNs enables accurate, efficient modeling and prediction of practical engineering problems, such as water flooding, polymer flooding, inclined flooding, and carbon dioxide injection into saline aquifers. Furthermore, the forward PINN framework with slight modifications can be adapted for inverse problems, allowing the estimation of PDE parameters in the Buckley-Leverett equation from observed data. Sensitivity analysis demonstrate that PINNs remain effective under conditions of slight data scarcity and up to a 5% data impurity.">

In this paper, we present a novel data-driven linear estimator that uses Koopman operator theory to extract finite-dimensional representations of complex nonlinear systems. The extracted model is used together with a deep reinforcement learning network that learns the optimal stepwise actions to predict future states of the original nonlinear system. Our estimator is also adaptive to a diffeomorphic transformation of the nonlinear system which enables transfer learning to compute state estimates of the transformed system without relearning from scratch.">

Classical approaches are formulated for PDEs on Hilbert spaces and involve one single linear space to approximate the set of PDE solutions. Here, we develop reduced models relying on a collection of linear or nonlinear approximation spaces called a library, and which can also be formulated on general metric spaces. To build the spaces of the library, we rely on greedy algorithms involving different splitting strategies which lead to a hierarchical tree-based representation. We illustrate through numerical examples that the proposed strategies have a much wider range of applicability in terms of the parametric PDEs that can successfully be addressed.

        <tr id="Recently, we have witnessed the success of total variation (TV) for many imaging applications. However, traditional TV is defined on the original pixel domain, which limits its potential. In this work, we suggest a new TV regularization defined on the neural domain. Concretely, the discrete data is continuously and implicitly represented by a deep neural network (DNN), and we use the derivatives of DNN outputs w.r.t. input coordinates to capture local correlations of data. As compared with classical TV on the original domain, the proposed TV on the neural domain (termed NeurTV) enjoys two advantages. First, NeurTV is not limited to meshgrid but is suitable for both meshgrid and non-meshgrid data. Second, NeurTV can more exactly capture local correlations across data for any direction and any order of derivatives attributed to the implicit and continuous nature of neural domain. We theoretically reinterpret NeurTV under the variational approximation framework, which allows us to build the connection between classical TV and NeurTV and inspires us to develop variants (e.g., NeurTV with arbitrary resolution and space-variant NeurTV). Extensive numerical experiments with meshgrid data (e.g., color and hyperspectral images) and non-meshgrid data (e.g., point clouds and spatial transcriptomics) showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models have emerged as preeminent contenders in the realm of generative models. Distinguished by their distinctive sequential generative processes, characterized by hundreds or even thousands of timesteps, diffusion models progressively reconstruct images from pure Gaussian noise, with each timestep necessitating full inference of the entire model. However, the substantial computational demands inherent to these models present challenges for deployment, quantization is thus widely used to lower the bit-width for reducing the storage and computing overheads. Current quantization methodologies primarily focus on model-side optimization, disregarding the temporal dimension, such as the length of the timestep sequence, thereby allowing redundant timesteps to continue consuming computational resources, leaving substantial scope for accelerating the generative process. In this paper, we introduce TMPQ-DM, which jointly optimizes timestep reduction and quantization to achieve a superior performance-efficiency trade-off, addressing both temporal and model optimization aspects. For timestep reduction, we devise a non-uniform grouping scheme tailored to the non-uniform nature of the denoising process, thereby mitigating the explosive combinations of timesteps. In terms of quantization, we adopt a fine-grained layer-wise approach to allocate varying bit-widths to different layers based on their respective contributions to the final generative performance, thus rectifying performance degradation observed in prior studies. To expedite the evaluation of fine-grained quantization, we further devise a super-network to serve as a precision solver by leveraging shared quantization results. These two design components are seamlessly integrated within our framework, enabling rapid joint exploration of the exponentially large decision space via a gradient-free evolutionary search algorithm.">

Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods.

        <tr id="In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces, but in a learning equilibrium, the problem can be linearized and reduced to many weakly coupled one-dimensional problems. We use the duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distributions of fluctuations of the trainable variables. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.">

        <tr id="Formulating dynamical models for physical phenomena is essential for understanding the interplay between the different mechanisms and predicting the evolution of physical states. However, a dynamical model alone is often insufficient to address these fundamental tasks, as it suffers from model errors and uncertainties. One common remedy is to rely on data assimilation, where the state estimate is updated with observations of the true system. Ensemble filters sequentially assimilate observations by updating a set of samples over time. They operate in two steps: a forecast step that propagates each sample through the dynamical model and an analysis step that updates the samples with incoming observations. For accurate and robust predictions of dynamical systems, discrete solutions must preserve their critical invariants. While modern numerical solvers satisfy these invariants, existing invariant-preserving analysis steps are limited to Gaussian settings and are often not compatible with classical regularization techniques of ensemble filters, e.g., inflation and covariance tapering. The present work focuses on preserving linear invariants, such as mass, stoichiometric balance of chemical species, and electrical charges. Using tools from measure transport theory (Spantini et al., 2022, SIAM Review), we introduce a generic class of nonlinear ensemble filters that automatically preserve desired linear invariants in non-Gaussian filtering problems. By specializing this framework to the Gaussian setting, we recover a constrained formulation of the Kalman filter. Then, we show how to combine existing regularization techniques for the ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994, J. Geophys. Res.) with the preservation of the linear invariants. Finally, we assess the benefits of preserving linear invariants for the ensemble Kalman filter and nonlinear ensemble filters.">

In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.">

        <tr id="Many research works have shown that the traditional alternating direction multiplier methods (ADMMs) can be better understood by continuous-time differential equations (DEs). On the other hand, many unfolded algorithms directly inherit the traditional iterations to build deep networks. Although they achieve superior practical performance and a faster convergence rate than traditional counterparts, there is a lack of clear insight into unfolded network structures. Thus, we attempt to explore the unfolded linearized ADMM (LADMM) from the perspective of DEs, and design more efficient unfolded networks. First, by proposing an unfolded Euler LADMM scheme and inspired by the trapezoid discretization, we design a new more accurate Trapezoid LADMM scheme. For the convenience of implementation, we provide its explicit version via a prediction-correction strategy. Then, to expand the representation space of unfolded networks, we design an accelerated variant of our Euler LADMM scheme, which can be interpreted as second-order DEs with stronger representation capabilities. To fully explore this representation space, we designed an accelerated Trapezoid LADMM scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore a comprehensive connection with theoretical guarantees between unfolded ADMMs and first-(second-) order DEs. Finally, we instantiate our schemes as (A-)ELADMM and (A-)TLADMM with the proximal operators, and (A-)ELADMM-Net and (A-)TLADMM-Net with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Extensive inverse problem experiments show that our Trapezoid LADMM schemes perform better than well-known methods.">

        <tr id="This work aims to improve generalization and interpretability of dynamical systems by recovering the underlying lower-dimensional latent states and their time evolutions. Previous work on disentangled representation learning within the realm of dynamical systems focused on the latent states, possibly with linear transition approximations. As such, they cannot identify nonlinear transition dynamics, and hence fail to reliably predict complex future behavior. Inspired by the advances in nonlinear ICA, we propose a state-space modeling framework in which we can identify not just the latent states but also the unknown transition function that maps the past states to the present. We introduce a practical algorithm based on variational auto-encoders and empirically demonstrate in realistic synthetic settings that we can (i) recover latent state dynamics with high accuracy, (ii) correspondingly achieve high future prediction accuracy, and (iii) adapt fast to new environments.">

        <tr id="We propose an actor-critic algorithm for a family of complex problems arising in algebraic statistics and discrete optimization. The core task is to produce a sample from a finite subset of the non-negative integer lattice defined by a high-dimensional polytope. We translate the problem into a Markov decision process and devise an actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to learn a set of good moves that can be used for sampling. We prove that the actor-critic algorithm converges to an approximately optimal sampling policy. To tackle complexity issues that typically arise in these sampling problems, and to allow the RL to function at scale, our solution strategy takes three steps: decomposing the starting point of the sample, using RL on each induced subproblem, and reconstructing to obtain a sample in the original polytope. In this setup, the proof of convergence applies to each subproblem in the decomposition. We test the method in two regimes. In statistical applications, a high-dimensional polytope arises as the support set for the reference distribution in a model/data fit test for a broad family of statistical models for categorical data. We demonstrate how RL can be used for model fit testing problems for data sets for which traditional MCMC samplers converge too slowly due to problem size and sparsity structure. To test the robustness of the algorithm and explore its generalization properties, we apply it to synthetically generated data of various sizes and sparsity levels.">

        <tr id="Recent years have seen a growing interest in understanding acceleration methods through the lens of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Despite the theoretical advancements, translating the rapid convergence observed in continuous-time models to discrete-time iterative methods poses significant challenges. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework integrating the inertial systems with Hessian-driven damping equation (ISHD) and learning-based approaches for developing optimization methods through a deep synergy of theoretical insights. We first establish the convergence condition for ensuring the convergence of the solution trajectory of ISHD. Then, we show that provided the stability condition, another relaxed requirement on the coefficients of ISHD, the sequence generated through the explicit Euler discretization of ISHD converges, which gives a large family of practical optimization methods. In order to select the best optimization method in this family for certain problems, we introduce the stopping time, the time required for an optimization method derived from ISHD to achieve a predefined level of suboptimality. Then, we formulate a novel learning to optimize (L2O) problem aimed at minimizing the stopping time subject to the convergence and stability condition. To navigate this learning problem, we present an algorithm combining stochastic optimization and the penalty method (StoPM). The convergence of StoPM using the conservative gradient is proved. Empirical validation of our framework is conducted through extensive numerical experiments across a diverse set of optimization problems. These experiments showcase the superior performance of the learned optimization methods.">

Despite the significant empirical success, theory of diffusion models is very limited, potentially slowing down principled methodological innovations for further harnessing and improving diffusion models. In this paper, we review emerging applications of diffusion models, understanding their sample generation under various controls. Next, we overview the existing theories of diffusion models, covering their statistical properties and sampling capabilities. We adopt a progressive routine, beginning with unconditional diffusion models and connecting to conditional counterparts. Further, we review a new avenue in high-dimensional structured optimization through conditional diffusion models, where searching for solutions is reformulated as a conditional sampling problem and solved by diffusion models. Lastly, we discuss future directions about diffusion models.

        <tr id="This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning (ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems found in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by differential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and hard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and no-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these constraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate algorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply training unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the differential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this approach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models innately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the well-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact) min-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for these infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then provide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are not only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even dominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly, these results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed problems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms used by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical systems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems with embedded optimal control problems.">

        <tr id="The multi-plane representation has been highlighted for its fast training and inference across static and dynamic neural radiance fields. This approach constructs relevant features via projection onto learnable grids and interpolating adjacent vertices. However, it has limitations in capturing low-frequency details and tends to overuse parameters for low-frequency features due to its bias toward fine details, despite its multi-resolution concept. This phenomenon leads to instability and inefficiency when training poses are sparse. In this work, we propose a method that synergistically integrates multi-plane representation with a coordinate-based MLP network known for strong bias toward low-frequency signals. The coordinate-based network is responsible for capturing low-frequency details, while the multi-plane representation focuses on capturing fine-grained details. We demonstrate that using residual connections between them seamlessly preserves their own inherent properties. Additionally, the proposed progressive training scheme accelerates the disentanglement of these two features. We demonstrate empirically that our proposed method not only outperforms baseline models for both static and dynamic NeRFs with sparse inputs, but also achieves comparable results with fewer parameters.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a real‐time optimization method for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) of systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The NMPC problem to be solved is formulated by discretizing the PDE system in space and time by using the finite difference method. The proposed method is called the double‐layer Jacobi method, which exploits both the spatial and temporal sparsities of the PDE‐constrained NMPC problem. In the upper layer, the NMPC problem is solved by ignoring the temporal couplings of either the state or costate (Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the state equation) equations so that the spatial sparsity is preserved. The lower‐layer Jacobi method is a linear solver dedicated to PDE‐constrained NMPC problems by exploiting the spatial sparsity. Convergence analysis indicates that the convergence of the proposed method is related to the prediction horizon. Results of a numerical experiment of controlling a heat transfer process show that the proposed method can be two orders of magnitude faster than the conventional Newton's method exploiting the banded structure of NMPC problems.">

Unlike conventional computational fluid dynamics methods, PINNs offer advantages by eliminating the need for discretized meshes and enabling the direct solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we propose the weighted Extended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WXPINNs) and weighted Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WCPINNs), tailored for detailed hemodynamic simulations based on generalized space-time domain decomposition techniques. The inclusion of multiple neural networks enhances the representation capacity of the weighted PINN methods. Furthermore, the weighted PINNs can be efficiently trained in parallel computing frameworks by employing separate neural networks for each sub-domain. We show that PINNs simulation results circumvent backflow instabilities, underscoring a notable advantage of employing PINNs over traditional numerical methods to solve such complex blood flow models. They naturally address such challenges within their formulations. The presented numerical results demonstrate that the proposed weighted PINNs outperform traditional PINNs settings, where sub-PINNs are applied to each subdomain separately.

        <tr id="Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.">

We propose a new method for direct multi-scale topology optimization using neural networks. Our approach focuses on inverse homogenization that seamlessly maintains compatibility across neighboring microstructure cells. Our approach consists of a topology neural network that optimizes the microstructure shape and distribution across the design domain as a continuous field. Each microstructure cell is optimized based on a specified elasticity tensor that also accommodates in-plane rotations. The neural network takes as input the local coordinates within a cell to represent the density distribution within a cell, as well as the global coordinates of each cell to design spatially varying microstructure cells. As such, our approach models an n-dimensional multi-scale optimization problem as a 2n-dimensional inverse homogenization problem using neural networks. During the inverse homogenization of each unit cell, we extend the boundary of each cell by scaling the input coordinates such that the boundaries of neighboring cells are combined. Inverse homogenization on the combined cell improves connectivity. We demonstrate our method through the design and optimization of graded multi-scale structures.">

        <tr id="This contribution extends the localized training approach, traditionally employed for multiscale problems and parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) featuring locally heterogeneous coefficients, to the class of linear, positive symmetric operators, known as Friedrichs' operators. Considering a local subdomain with corresponding oversampling domain we prove the compactness of the transfer operator which maps boundary data to solutions on the interior domain. While a Caccioppoli-inequality quantifying the energy decay to the interior holds true for all Friedrichs' systems, showing a compactness result for the graph-spaces hosting the solution is additionally necessary. We discuss the mixed formulation of a convection-diffusion-reaction problem where the necessary compactness result is obtained by the Picard-Weck-Weber theorem. Our numerical results, focusing on a scenario involving heterogeneous diffusion fields with multiple high-conductivity channels, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.">

Our main theorem states that the sequence constructed by the original DDPM sampling algorithm weakly converges to a given data distribution as the number of time steps goes to infinity, under some asymptotic conditions on the parameters for the variance schedule, the $L^2$-based score estimation error, and the noise estimating function with respect to the number of time steps. In proving the theorem, we reveal that the sampling sequence can be seen as an exponential integrator type approximation of a reverse time stochastic differential equation (SDE). Moreover, we give a proper definition of the backward It\^o integral for general continuous processes and prove rigorously the reverse time representation of a given SDE with backward It\^o integral, without using the smoothness and uniqueness of the associated forward Kolmogorov equations.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models with large-scale pre-training have achieved significant success in the field of visual content generation, particularly exemplified by Diffusion Transformers (DiT). However, DiT models have faced challenges with scalability and quadratic complexity efficiency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers, expanding its applicability to diffusion models. We introduce Diffusion Gated Linear Attention Transformers (DiG), a simple, adoptable solution with minimal parameter overhead, following the DiT design, but offering superior efficiency and effectiveness. In addition to better performance than DiT, DiG-S/2 exhibits $2.5\times$ higher training speed than DiT-S/2 and saves $75.7\%$ GPU memory at a resolution of $1792 \times 1792$. Moreover, we analyze the scalability of DiG across a variety of computational complexity. DiG models, with increased depth/width or augmentation of input tokens, consistently exhibit decreasing FID. We further compare DiG with other subquadratic-time diffusion models. With the same model size, DiG-XL/2 is $4.2\times$ faster than the recent Mamba-based diffusion model at a $1024$ resolution, and is $1.8\times$ faster than DiT with CUDA-optimized FlashAttention-2 under the $2048$ resolution. All these results demonstrate its superior efficiency among the latest diffusion models. Code is released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiG.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models recently proved to be remarkable priors for Bayesian inverse problems. However, training these models typically requires access to large amounts of clean data, which could prove difficult in some settings. In this work, we present a novel method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm for training diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations only. Unlike previous works, our method leads to proper diffusion models, which is crucial for downstream tasks. As part of our method, we propose and motivate a new posterior sampling scheme for unconditional diffusion models. We present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method.">

        <tr id="Random features (RFs) are a popular technique to scale up kernel methods in machine learning, replacing exact kernel evaluations with stochastic Monte Carlo estimates. They underpin models as diverse as efficient transformers (by approximating attention) to sparse spectrum Gaussian processes (by approximating the covariance function). Efficiency can be further improved by speeding up the convergence of these estimates: a variance reduction problem. We tackle this through the unifying framework of optimal transport, using theoretical insights and numerical algorithms to develop novel, high-performing RF couplings for kernels defined on Euclidean and discrete input spaces. They enjoy concrete theoretical performance guarantees and sometimes provide strong empirical downstream gains, including for scalable approximate inference on graphs. We reach surprising conclusions about the benefits and limitations of variance reduction as a paradigm.">

Due to the appearance of a neural network on the right-hand side of the equations of motion, the resulting satellite dynamics is governed by a NeuralODE, a neural Ordinary Differential Equation, characterized by its fully differentiable nature, allowing the derivation of variational equations (hence of the state transition matrix) and facilitating its use in connection to advanced numerical techniques such as Taylor-based numerical propagation and differential algebraic techniques. Efficient training of the network parameters occurs through two distinct approaches. In the first approach, the network undergoes training independently of spacecraft dynamics, engaging in a pure regression task against ground truth models, including JB-08 and NRLMSISE-00. In the second paradigm, network parameters are learned based on observed dynamics, adapting through ODE sensitivities. In both cases, the outcome is a flexible, compact model of the thermosphere density greatly enhancing numerical propagation efficiency while maintaining accuracy in the orbital predictions.">

        <tr id="Neural networks can identify low-dimensional relevant structures within high-dimensional noisy data, yet our mathematical understanding of how they do so remains scarce. Here, we investigate the training dynamics of two-layer shallow neural networks trained with gradient-based algorithms, and discuss how they learn pertinent features in multi-index models, that is target functions with low-dimensional relevant directions. In the high-dimensional regime, where the input dimension $d$ diverges, we show that a simple modification of the idealized single-pass gradient descent training scenario, where data can now be repeated or iterated upon twice, drastically improves its computational efficiency. In particular, it surpasses the limitations previously believed to be dictated by the Information and Leap exponents associated with the target function to be learned. Our results highlight the ability of networks to learn relevant structures from data alone without any pre-processing. More precisely, we show that (almost) all directions are learned with at most $O(d \log d)$ steps. Among the exceptions is a set of hard functions that includes sparse parities. In the presence of coupling between directions, however, these can be learned sequentially through a hierarchical mechanism that generalizes the notion of staircase functions. Our results are proven by a rigorous study of the evolution of the relevant statistics for high-dimensional dynamics.">

        <tr id="Partial differential equations (PDEs) involving high contrast and oscillating coefficients are common in scientific and industrial applications. Numerical approximation of these PDEs is a challenging task that can be addressed, for example, by multi-scale finite element analysis. For linear problems, multi-scale finite element method (MsFEM) is well established and some viable extensions to non-linear PDEs are known. However, some features of the method seem to be intrinsically based on linearity-based. In particular, traditional MsFEM rely on the reuse of computations. For example, the stiffness matrix can be calculated just once, while being used for several right-hand sides, or as part of a multi-level iterative algorithm. Roughly speaking, the offline phase of the method amounts to pre-assembling the local linear Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operators. We present some preliminary results concerning the combination of MsFEM with machine learning tools. The extension of MsFEM to nonlinear problems is achieved by means of learning local nonlinear DtN maps. The resulting learning-based multi-scale method is tested on a set of model nonlinear PDEs involving the $p-$Laplacian and degenerate nonlinear diffusion.">

        <tr id="Since infectious pathogens start spreading into a susceptible population, mathematical models can provide policy makers with reliable forecasts and scenario analyses, which can be concretely implemented or solely consulted. In these complex epidemiological scenarios, machine learning architectures can play an important role, since they directly reconstruct data-driven models circumventing the specific modelling choices and the parameter calibration, typical of classical compartmental models. In this work, we discuss the efficacy of Kernel Operator Learning (KOL) to reconstruct population dynamics during epidemic outbreaks, where the transmission rate is ruled by an input strategy. In particular, we introduce two surrogate models, named KOL-m and KOL-$\partial$, which reconstruct in two different ways the evolution of the epidemics. Moreover, we evaluate the generalization performances of the two approaches with different kernels, including the Neural Tangent Kernels, and compare them with a classical neural network model learning method. Employing synthetic but semi-realistic data, we show how the two introduced approaches are suitable for realizing fast and robust forecasts and scenario analyses, and how these approaches are competitive for determining optimal intervention strategies with respect to specific performance measures.">

The proposed GAIT (Generative Artificial Intelligence Turbulence) model is based on the coupling of a convolutional variational auto-encoder, that encodes precomputed turbulence data into a reduce latent space, and a deep neural network and decoder that generate new turbulence states 400 times faster than the direct numerical integration. The model is applied to the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) plasma turbulence model, that is closely related to the quasigeostrophic model used in geophysical fluid dynamics. Very good agreement is found between the GAIT and the HW models in the spatio-temporal Fourier and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition spectra as well as in the flow topology characterized by the Okubo-Weiss decomposition. Agreement is also found in the probability distribution function of particle displacements and the effective turbulent diffusivity.">
