        <tr id="Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to harness labeled source data to train models for unlabeled target data. Despite extensive research in domains like computer vision and natural language processing, UDA remains underexplored for time series data, which has widespread real-world applications ranging from medicine and manufacturing to earth observation and human activity recognition. Our paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating UDA techniques for time series classification, with a focus on deep learning methods. We provide seven new benchmark datasets covering various domain shifts and temporal dynamics, facilitating fair and standardized UDA method assessments with state of the art neural network backbones (e.g. Inception) for time series data. This benchmark offers insights into the strengths and limitations of the evaluated approaches while preserving the unsupervised nature of domain adaptation, making it directly applicable to practical problems. Our paper serves as a vital resource for researchers and practitioners, advancing domain adaptation solutions for time series data and fostering innovation in this critical field. The implementation code of this benchmark is available at https://github.com/EricssonResearch/UDA-4-TSC.">

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation methods aim at generalizing well on unlabeled test data that may have a different (shifted) distribution from the training data. Such methods are typically developed on image data, and their application to time series data is less explored. Existing works on time series domain adaptation suffer from inconsistencies in evaluation schemes, datasets, and backbone neural network architectures. Moreover, labeled target data are often used for model selection, which violates the fundamental assumption of unsupervised domain adaptation. To address these issues, we develop a benchmarking evaluation suite (AdaTime) to systematically and fairly evaluate different domain adaptation methods on time series data. Specifically, we standardize the backbone neural network architectures and benchmarking datasets, while also exploring more realistic model selection approaches that can work with no labeled data or just a few labeled samples. Our evaluation includes adapting state-of-the-art visual domain adaptation methods to time series data as well as the recent methods specifically developed for time series data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate 11 state-of-the-art methods on five representative datasets spanning 50 cross-domain scenarios. Our results suggest that with careful selection of hyper-parameters, visual domain adaptation methods are competitive with methods proposed for time series domain adaptation. In addition, we find that hyper-parameters could be selected based on realistic model selection approaches. Our work unveils practical insights for applying domain adaptation methods on time series data and builds a solid foundation for future works in the field. The code is available at github.com/emadeldeen24/AdaTime.">

        <tr id="Domain generalization methods aim to learn models robust to domain shift with data from a limited number of source domains and without access to target domain samples during training. Popular domain alignment methods for domain generalization seek to extract domain-invariant features by minimizing the discrepancy between feature distributions across all domains, disregarding inter-domain relationships. In this paper, we instead propose a novel representation learning methodology that selectively enforces prediction consistency between source domains estimated to be closely-related. Specifically, we hypothesize that domains share different class-informative representations, so instead of aligning all domains which can cause negative transfer, we only regularize the discrepancy between closely-related domains. We apply our method to time-series classification tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments on three public real-world datasets. Our method significantly improves over the baseline and achieves better or competitive performance in comparison with state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and model calibration.">

        <tr id="Recently, deep neural networks have gained increasing popularity in the field of time series forecasting. A primary reason for their success is their ability to effectively capture complex temporal dynamics across multiple related time series. The advantages of these deep forecasters only start to emerge in the presence of a sufficient amount of data. This poses a challenge for typical forecasting problems in practice, where there is a limited number of time series or observations per time series, or both. To cope with this data scarcity issue, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework, Domain Adaptation Forecaster (DAF). DAF leverages statistical strengths from a relevant domain with abundant data samples (source) to improve the performance on the domain of interest with limited data (target). In particular, we use an attention-based shared module with a domain discriminator across domains and private modules for individual domains. We induce domain-invariant latent features (queries and keys) and retrain domain-specific features (values) simultaneously to enable joint training of forecasters on source and target domains. A main insight is that our design of aligning keys allows the target domain to leverage source time series even with different characteristics. Extensive experiments on various domains demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets, and ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our design choices.">

        <tr id="In many real-world scenarios, machine learning models fall short in prediction performance due to data characteristics changing from training on one source domain to testing on a target domain. There has been extensive research to address this problem with Domain Adaptation (DA) for learning domain invariant features. However, when considering advances for time series, those methods remain limited to the use of hard parameter sharing (HPS) between source and target models, and the use of domain adaptation objective function. To address these challenges, we propose a soft parameter sharing (SPS) DA architecture with representation learning while modeling the relation as non-linear between parameters of source and target models and modeling the adaptation loss function as the squared Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The proposed architecture advances the state-of-the-art for time series in the context of activity recognition and in fields with other modalities, where SPS has been limited to a linear relation. An additional contribution of our work is to provide a study that demonstrates the strengths and limitations of HPS versus SPS. Experiment results showed the success of the method in three domain adaptation cases of multivariate time series activity recognition with different users and sensors.">

        <tr id="While large volumes of unlabeled data are usually available, associated labels are often scarce. The unsupervised domain adaptation problem aims at exploiting labels from a source domain to classify data from a related, yet different, target domain. When time series are at stake, new difficulties arise as temporal shifts may appear in addition to the standard feature distribution shift. In this paper, we introduce the Match-And-Deform (MAD) approach that aims at finding correspondences between the source and target time series while allowing temporal distortions. The associated optimization problem simultaneously aligns the series thanks to an optimal transport loss and the time stamps through dynamic time warping. When embedded into a deep neural network, MAD helps learning new representations of time series that both align the domains and maximize the discriminative power of the network. Empirical studies on benchmark datasets and remote sensing data demonstrate that MAD makes meaningful sample-to-sample pairing and time shift estimation, reaching similar or better classification performance than state-of-the-art deep time series domain adaptation strategies.">
