        <tr id="Significance Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.">

        <tr id="Significance Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science. The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.">

        <tr id="Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.">

        <tr id="Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.">

        <tr id="Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.">

        <tr id="A key task in the field of modeling and analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems is the recovery of unknown governing equations from measurement data only. There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems (MANDy) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions. The efficiency of the introduced approach will be illustrated with the aid of several high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="First principles modeling of physical systems has led to significant technological advances across all branches of science. For nonlinear systems, however, small modeling errors can lead to significant deviations from the true, measured behavior. Even in mechanical systems, where the equations are assumed to be well-known, there are often model discrepancies corresponding to nonlinear friction, wind resistance, etc. Discovering models for these discrepancies remains an open challenge for many complex systems. In this work, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to discover a model for the discrepancy between a simplified model and measurement data. In particular, we assume that the model mismatch can be sparsely represented in a library of candidate model terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several examples including experimental data from a double pendulum on a cart. We further design and implement a feed-forward controller in simulations, showing improvement with a discrepancy model.">

However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further modification.">

        <tr id="Researchers propose sparse regression for identifying governing partial differential equations for spatiotemporal systems. We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.">

        <tr id="Sparse model identification enables the discovery of nonlinear dynamical systems purely from data; however, this approach is sensitive to noise, especially in the low-data limit. In this work, we leverage the statistical approach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to several synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate substantial improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected from 1900 to 1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be exploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.">

Sparse regression, in particular, has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: 1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning; 2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations; and 3) the methods apply to composite regularizers, essential for total variation (TV) as well as sparsity-promoting formulations using tight frames. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, and greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. Following standards of reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.">

However, existing equation discovery algorithms rely on the availability of noisy measurements of the state variables (i.e., displacement {and velocity}). This is a major bottleneck in structural dynamics, where we often only have access to acceleration measurements. To that end, this paper introduces a novel equation discovery algorithm for discovering governing equations of dynamical systems from acceleration-only measurements. The proposed algorithm employs a library-based approach for equation discovery. To enable equation discovery from acceleration-only measurements, we propose a novel Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) model that prioritizes parsimonious models. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using {four} structural dynamics examples that include both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems.

        <tr id="This work presents a data-driven method for learning low-dimensional time-dependent physics-based surrogate models whose predictions are endowed with uncertainty estimates. We use the operator inference approach to model reduction that poses the problem of learning low-dimensional model terms as a regression of state space data and corresponding time derivatives by minimizing the residual of reduced system equations. Standard operator inference models perform well with accurate training data that are dense in time, but producing stable and accurate models when the state data are noisy and/or sparse in time remains a challenge. Another challenge is the lack of uncertainty estimation for the predictions from the operator inference models. Our approach addresses these challenges by incorporating Gaussian process surrogates into the operator inference framework to (1) probabilistically describe uncertainties in the state predictions and (2) procure analytical time derivative estimates with quantified uncertainties. The formulation leads to a generalized least-squares regression and, ultimately, reduced-order models that are described probabilistically with a closed-form expression for the posterior distribution of the operators. The resulting probabilistic surrogate model propagates uncertainties from the observed state data to reduced-order predictions. We demonstrate the method is effective for constructing low-dimensional models of two nonlinear partial differential equations representing a compressible flow and a nonlinear diffusion-reaction process, as well as for estimating the parameters of a low-dimensional system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations representing compartmental models in epidemiology.">

In this work we extend SINDy to identify delay differential equations by using an augmented library that includes delayed samples and Bayesian optimization. To identify a possibly unknown delay we minimize the reconstruction error over a set of candidates. The resulting methodology improves the overall performance by remarkably reducing the number of calls to SINDy with respect to a brute force approach. We also address a multivariate setting to identify multiple unknown delays and (non-multiplicative) parameters. Several numerical tests on delay differential equations with different long-term behavior, number of variables, delays, and parameters support the use of Bayesian optimization highlighting both the efficacy of the proposed methodology and its computational advantages.

Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning.

        <tr id="Model parsimony is an important \emph{cognitive bias} in data-driven modelling that aids interpretability and helps to prevent over-fitting. Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) methods are able to learn sparse representations of complex dynamics directly from data, given a basis of library functions. In this work, a novel Bayesian treatment of dictionary learning system identification, as an alternative to SINDy, is envisaged. The proposed method -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics (BINDy) -- is distinct from previous approaches in that it targets the full joint posterior distribution over both the terms in the library and their parameterisation in the model. This formulation confers the advantage that an arbitrary prior may be placed over the model structure to produce models that are sparse in the model space rather than in parameter space. Because this posterior is defined over parameter vectors that can change in dimension, the inference cannot be performed by standard techniques. Instead, a Gibbs sampler based on reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo is proposed. BINDy is shown to compare favourably to ensemble SINDy in three benchmark case-studies. In particular, it is seen that the proposed method is better able to assign high probability to correct model terms.">

While these flows may exhibit rich and multiscale dynamics, in many cases underlying low-rank structures exist which describe the bulk of the motion.

The extraction and parsimonious representation of these low-rank dynamics from high-dimensional data is a key challenge. Inspired by the success of physics-informed machine learning methods, we propose a spectrally-informed approach to extract low-rank models of fluid flows by leveraging known spectral properties in the learning process. We incorporate this knowledge by imposing regularizations on the learned dynamics, which bias the training process towards learning low-frequency structures with corresponding higher power. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method to improve prediction and produce learned models which better match the underlying spectral properties of prototypical fluid flows.">

The working mechanism and its accuracy and efficiency were experimentally verified by solving typical linear and non-linear (e.g., Primer, Van der Pol, Duffing) oscillator ODEs. We demonstrate that the DeepXDE-based implementation of PINN is not only light code and efficient in training, but also flexible across CPU/GPU platforms. PINN greatly reduces the need for labeled data: when the nonlinearity of the ODE is weak, a very small amount of supervised training data plus a few unsupervised collocation points are sufficient to predict the solution; in the minimalist case, only one or two training points (with initial values) are needed for first- or second-order ODEs, respectively. We also find that, with the aid of collocation points and the use of physical information, PINN has the ability to extrapolate data outside the time domain of the training set, and especially is robust to noisy data, thus with enhanced generalization capabilities. Training is accelerated when the gains obtained along with the reduction in the amount of data outweigh the delay caused by the increase in the loss function terms. The soft-constrained PINN can easily impose a physical law (e.g., conservation of energy) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, thus improving the solution performance to ODEs that obey this physical law. Furthermore, PINN can also be used for stiff ODEs, PDEs, and other types of DEs, and is becoming a favorable catalyst for the era of Digital Twins.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a sequence of two approaches for the data-driven control-oriented modeling of networked systems, i.e., the systems that involve many interacting dynamical components. First, a novel deep learning approach named the weak Latent Dynamics Model (wLDM) is developed for learning generic nonlinear dynamics with control. Leveraging the weak form, the wLDM enables more numerically stable and computationally efficient training as well as more accurate prediction, when compared to conventional methods such as neural ordinary differential equations. Building upon the wLDM framework, we propose the weak Graph Koopman Bilinear Form (wGKBF) model, which integrates geometric deep learning and Koopman theory to learn latent space dynamics for networked systems, especially for the challenging cases having multiple timescales. The effectiveness of the wLDM framework and wGKBF model are demonstrated on three example systems of increasing complexity - a controlled double pendulum, the stiff Brusselator dynamics, and an electrified aircraft energy system. These numerical examples show that the wLDM and wGKBF achieve superior predictive accuracy and training efficiency as compared to baseline models. Parametric studies provide insights into the effects of hyperparameters in the weak form. The proposed framework shows the capability to efficiently capture control-dependent dynamics in these systems, including stiff dynamics and multi-physics interactions, offering a promising direction for learning control-oriented models of complex networked systems.">

        <tr id="Time-varying linear state-space models are powerful tools for obtaining mathematically interpretable representations of neural signals. For example, switching and decomposed models describe complex systems using latent variables that evolve according to simple locally linear dynamics. However, existing methods for latent variable estimation are not robust to dynamical noise and system nonlinearity due to noise-sensitive inference procedures and limited model formulations. This can lead to inconsistent results on signals with similar dynamics, limiting the model's ability to provide scientific insight. In this work, we address these limitations and propose a probabilistic approach to latent variable estimation in decomposed models that improves robustness against dynamical noise. Additionally, we introduce an extended latent dynamics model to improve robustness against system nonlinearities. We evaluate our approach on several synthetic dynamical systems, including an empirically-derived brain-computer interface experiment, and demonstrate more accurate latent variable inference in nonlinear systems with diverse noise conditions. Furthermore, we apply our method to a real-world clinical neurophysiology dataset, illustrating the ability to identify interpretable and coherent structure where previous models cannot.">

Training these models is classically a data-fitting task, but knowledge of the expression of the differential equation can be used to supplement the training objective, leading to the development of physics-informed scientific machine learning. In this article, we focus on one class of models called nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Motivated by connections to numerical integration and physics-informed neural networks, we explicitly derive the physics-informed NVAR (piNVAR) which enforces the right-hand side of the underlying differential equation regardless of NVAR construction. Because NVAR and piNVAR completely share their learned parameters, we propose an augmented procedure to jointly train the two models. Then, using both data-driven and ODE-driven metrics, we evaluate the ability of the piNVAR model to predict solutions to various ODE systems, such as the undamped spring, a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey nonlinear model, and the chaotic Lorenz system.">

        <tr id="Stochastic collocation (SC) is a well‐known non‐intrusive method of constructing surrogate models for uncertainty quantification. In dynamical systems, SC is especially suited for full‐field uncertainty propagation that characterizes the distributions of the high‐dimensional solution fields of a model with stochastic input parameters. However, due to the highly nonlinear nature of the parameter‐to‐solution map in even the simplest dynamical systems, the constructed SC surrogates are often inaccurate. This work presents an alternative approach, where we apply the SC approximation over the dynamics of the model, rather than the solution. By combining the data‐driven sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics framework with SC, we construct dynamics surrogates and integrate them through time to construct the surrogate solutions. We demonstrate that the SC‐over‐dynamics framework leads to smaller errors, both in terms of the approximated system trajectories as well as the model state distributions, when compared against full‐field SC applied to the solutions directly. We present numerical evidence of this improvement using three test problems: a chaotic ordinary differential equation, and two partial differential equations from solid mechanics.">

        <tr id="Data-driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) has emerged as a promising approach for deriving governing physics when domain knowledge about observed data is limited. Despite recent progress, the identification of governing equations and their parametric dependencies using conventional information criteria remains challenging in noisy situations, as the criteria tend to select overly complex PDEs. In this paper, we introduce an extension of the uncertainty-penalized Bayesian information criterion (UBIC), which is adapted to solve parametric PDE discovery problems efficiently without requiring computationally expensive PDE simulations. This extended UBIC uses quantified PDE uncertainty over different temporal or spatial points to prevent overfitting in model selection. The UBIC is computed with data transformation based on power spectral densities to discover the governing parametric PDE that truly captures qualitative features in frequency space with a few significant terms and their parametric dependencies (i.e., the varying PDE coefficients), evaluated with confidence intervals. Numerical experiments on canonical PDEs demonstrate that our extended UBIC can identify the true number of terms and their varying coefficients accurately, even in the presence of noise.

For complex systems, these models become too large for real-time applications or multi-query workflows. Hence, model reduction is needed. However, the mathematical operators of these models are often not available since, as is common in industry practice, the models are constructed using commercial simulation software. In this work, we propose an operator inference-based approach aimed at inferring, from data generated by the simulation model, reduced-order models (ROMs) of structural dynamics systems with stiffness terms represented by polynomials of arbitrary degree. To ensure physically meaningful models, we impose constraints on the inference such that the model is guaranteed to exhibit stability properties. Convexity of the optimization problem associated with the inference is maintained by applying a sum-of-squares relaxation to the polynomial term. To further reduce the size of the ROM and improve numerical conditioning of the inference, we also propose a novel clustering-based sparsification of the polynomial term. We validate the proposed method on several numerical examples, including a representative 3D Finite Element Model (FEM) of a steel piston rod.">

Such uncertainties can arise in the selection of an appropriate state-space representation, in the projection step that underlies many reduced-order modeling methods, or as a byproduct of considerations made during training, to name a few. Following previous works in the literature, the proposed method captures these uncertainties by expanding the approximation space through the randomization of the projection matrix. This is achieved by combining Riemannian projection and retraction operators - acting on a subset of the Stiefel manifold - with an information-theoretic formulation. The efficacy of the approach is assessed on canonical problems in fluid mechanics by identifying and quantifying the impact of model-form uncertainties on the inferred operators.">

Both algorithms are based on a continuous data assimilation (CDA) algorithm for state reconstruction of A. Azouani, E. Olson, and E.S. Titi \cite{Azouani_Olson_Titi_2014}. Due to the CDA origins of these parameter recovery algorithms, these schemes provide on-the-fly reconstruction, that is, as data is collected, of unknown state and parameters simultaneously. It is shown how both algorithms give way to a robust general framework for simultaneous state and parameter estimation. In particular, we develop a general theory, applicable to a large class of dissipative dynamical systems, which identifies structural and algorithmic conditions under which the proposed algorithms achieve reconstruction of the true parameters. The algorithms are implemented on a high-dimensional two-layer Lorenz 96 model, where the theoretical conditions of the general framework are explicitly verifiable. They are also implemented on the two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithms beyond the finite-dimensional setting.

Thus, it is desirable to make the understanding of linear system available in the nonlinear setting. This motivates the search for linearization techniques which are able to represent the nonlinear system by an equivalent, linear system. While much progress has been made extending various linearization techniques to larger domains and more delicate attractor geometries, the limitations of such techniques for truly nonlinear dynamics, such as dynamics with coexisting attractors, have been pointed out recently. In this work, we show that genuinely nonlinear dynamics can be globally linearized. To this end, we investigate systems with a continuous spectrum, a limit cycle, and coexisting solutions and explicitly construct linear systems mimicking these nonlinear behaviors as close as possible. We approximate the transformations between linear and nonlinear system with deep neural networks. The obtained linearizations are finite dimensional exceeding the phase space dimension of the underlying linear system by one at most.">

To mitigate this, we present a data-driven system identification framework that derives models in the port-Hamiltonian (pH) formulation. This formulation is suitable for multi-physical systems while guaranteeing the useful system theoretical properties of passivity and stability. Our framework combines linear and nonlinear reduction with structured, physics-motivated system identification. In this process, high-dimensional state data obtained from possibly nonlinear systems serves as input for an autoencoder, which then performs two tasks: (i) nonlinearly transforming and (ii) reducing this data onto a low-dimensional latent space. In this space, a linear pH system, that satisfies the pH properties per construction, is parameterized by the weights of a neural network. The mathematical requirements are met by defining the pH matrices through Cholesky factorizations. The neural networks that define the coordinate transformation and the pH system are identified in a joint optimization process to match the dynamics observed in the data while defining a linear pH system in the latent space. The learned, low-dimensional pH system can describe even nonlinear systems and is rapidly computable due to its small size. The method is exemplified by a parametric mass-spring-damper and a nonlinear pendulum example, as well as the high-dimensional model of a disc brake with linear thermoelastic behavior.">

In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs).

In this study, we propose a novel method of modeling such dynamics, including the high-frequency intermittent behavior of a fluid flow, by considering another variable (base variable) showing relatively simple, less intermittent behavior. We construct an autonomous joint model composed of two parts: the first is an autonomous system of a base variable, and the other concerns the targeted variable being affected by a term involving the base variable to demonstrate complex dynamics. The constructed joint model succeeded in not only inferring a short trajectory but also reconstructing chaotic sets and statistical properties obtained from a long trajectory such as the density distributions of the actual dynamics.">

        <tr id="Unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) are believed to be the underlying dynamical structures of spatio-temporal chaos and turbulence. Finding these UPOs is however notoriously difficult. Matrix-free loop convergence algorithms deform entire space-time fields (loops) until they satisfy the evolution equations. Initial guesses for these robust variational convergence algorithms are thus periodic space-time fields in a high-dimensional state space, rendering their generation highly challenging. Usually guesses are generated with recurrency methods, which are most suited to shorter and more stable periodic orbits. Here we propose an alternative, data-driven method for generating initial guesses: while the dimension of the space used to discretize fluid flows is prohibitively large to construct suitable initial guesses, the dissipative dynamics will collapse onto a chaotic attractor of far lower dimension. We use an autoencoder to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the discretized physical space for the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinksy equation, in chaotic and hyperchaotic regimes. In this low-dimensional latent space, we construct loops based on the latent POD modes with random periodic coefficients, which are then decoded to physical space and used as initial guesses. These loops are found to be realistic initial guesses and, together with variational convergence algorithms, these guesses help us to quickly converge to UPOs. We further attempt to 'glue' known UPOs in the latent space to create guesses for longer ones. This gluing procedure is successful and points towards a hierarchy of UPOs where longer UPOs shadow sequences of shorter ones.">

A prominent contemporary example is from aerospace propulsion, where HPC is used for rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) simulations in support of the design of next-generation rocket engines; however, these simulations take millions of core hours even on powerful supercomputers, which makes them impractical for engineering tasks like design exploration and risk assessment. Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this limitation by constructing computationally cheap yet sufficiently accurate approximations that serve as surrogates for the high-fidelity model. This paper contributes a new distributed algorithm that achieves fast and scalable construction of predictive physics-based ROMs trained from sparse datasets of extremely large state dimension. The algorithm learns structured physics-based ROMs that approximate the dynamical systems underlying those datasets. This enables model reduction for problems at a scale and complexity that exceeds the capabilities of existing approaches. We demonstrate our algorithm's scalability using up to $2,048$ cores on the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. We focus on a real-world three-dimensional RDRE for which one millisecond of simulated physical time requires one million core hours on a supercomputer. Using a training dataset of $2,536$ snapshots each of state dimension $76$ million, our distributed algorithm enables the construction of a predictive data-driven reduced model in just $13$ seconds on $2,048$ cores on Frontera.">

By varying the Reynolds number, different flow regimes emerge, ranging from steady symmetric flows to quasi-periodic asymmetric and turbulence. We show, that the proposed non-linear manifold learning scheme, identifies in a crisp manner the expected intrinsic dimension of the underlying emerging dynamics over the parameter space. In particular, PDMs, estimate that the emergent dynamics in the oscillatory regime can be captured by just two variables, while in the chaotic regime, the dominant modes are three as anticipated by the normal form theory. On the other hand, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)/PCA, most commonly used for dimensionality reduction in fluid mechanics, does not provide such a crisp separation between the dominant modes. To validate the performance of PDMs, we also computed the reconstruction error, by constructing a decoder using Geometric Harmonics. We show that the proposed scheme outperforms the POD/PCA over the whole Reynolds number range. Thus, we believe that the proposed scheme will allow for the development of more accurate reduced order models for high-fidelity fluid dynamics simulators, thus relaxing the curse of dimensionality in numerical analysis tasks such as bifurcation analysis, optimization and control.">

Standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for fitting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time-series data involve proposing trial parameter sets, numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time, and accepting or rejecting the trial parameter sets. When the model dynamics depend nonlinearly on the parameters, as is generally the case, trial parameter sets are often rejected, and MCMC approaches become prohibitively computationally costly to converge. Here, we build on methods for numerical continuation and trajectory optimization to introduce an approach in which we use Langevin dynamics in the joint space of variables and parameters to sample models that satisfy constraints on the dynamics. We demonstrate the method by sampling Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles of a model of a biochemical oscillator in a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation, and we obtain more than a hundred fold speedup relative to a leading ensemble MCMC approach that requires numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time. We describe numerical experiments that provide insight into the speedup. The method is general and can be used in any framework for parameter estimation and model selection.">

To this end, statistical methods which describe high-dimensional neural time series in terms of low-dimensional latent dynamics have played a fundamental role in characterizing neural systems. Yet, what constitutes a successful method involves two opposing criteria: (1) methods should be expressive enough to capture complex nonlinear dynamics, and (2) they should maintain a notion of interpretability often only warranted by simpler linear models. In this paper, we develop an approach that balances these two objectives: the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS). Our method builds on previous work modeling the latent state evolution via a stochastic differential equation whose nonlinear dynamics are described by a Gaussian process (GP-SDEs). We propose a novel kernel function which enforces smoothly interpolated locally linear dynamics, and therefore expresses flexible -- yet interpretable -- dynamics akin to those of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS). Our approach resolves key limitations of the rSLDS such as artifactual oscillations in dynamics near discrete state boundaries, while also providing posterior uncertainty estimates of the dynamics. To fit our models, we leverage a modified learning objective which improves the estimation accuracy of kernel hyperparameters compared to previous GP-SDE fitting approaches. We apply our method to synthetic data and data recorded in two neuroscience experiments and demonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the rSLDS.">

        <tr id="Forecasting dynamical systems is of importance to numerous real-world applications. When possible, dynamical systems forecasts are constructed based on first-principles-based models such as through the use of differential equations. When these equations are unknown, non-intrusive techniques must be utilized to build predictive models from data alone. Machine learning (ML) methods have recently been used for such tasks. Moreover, ML methods provide the added advantage of significant reductions in time-to-solution for predictions in contrast with first-principle based models. However, many state-of-the-art ML-based methods for forecasting rely on neural networks, which may be expensive to train and necessitate requirements for large amounts of memory. In this work, we propose a quantum mechanics inspired ML modeling strategy for learning nonlinear dynamical systems that provides data-driven forecasts for complex dynamical systems with reduced training time and memory costs. This approach, denoted the quantum reservoir computing technique (QRC), is a hybrid quantum-classical framework employing an ensemble of interconnected small quantum systems via classical linear feedback connections. By mapping the dynamical state to a suitable quantum representation amenable to unitary operations, QRC is able to predict complex nonlinear dynamical systems in a stable and accurate manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through benchmark forecasts of the NOAA Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature dataset and compare the performance of QRC to other ML methods.">

Our framework casts this latter task as a nonlinear dimensionality reduction problem, while constraining the latent state to evolve accordingly to an (unknown) dynamical system. A time-continuous setting is employed to derive error and stability estimates for the LDM approximation of the full order model (FOM) solution. We analyze the impact of using an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme in the time-discrete setting, resulting in the $\Delta\text{LDM}$ formulation, and further explore the learnable setting, $\Delta\text{LDM}_\theta$, where deep neural networks approximate the discrete LDM components, while providing a bounded approximation error with respect to the FOM. Moreover, we extend the concept of parameterized Neural ODE - recently proposed as a possible way to build data-driven dynamical systems with varying input parameters - to be a convolutional architecture, where the input parameters information is injected by means of an affine modulation mechanism, while designing a convolutional autoencoder neural network able to retain spatial-coherence, thus enhancing interpretability at the latent level. Numerical experiments, including the Burgers' and the advection-reaction-diffusion equations, demonstrate the framework's ability to obtain, in a multi-query context, a time-continuous approximation of the FOM solution, thus being able to query the LDM approximation at any given time instance while retaining a prescribed level of accuracy. Our findings highlight the remarkable potential of the proposed LDMs, representing a mathematically rigorous framework to enhance the accuracy and approximation capabilities of reduced order modeling for time-dependent parameterized PDEs.">

        <tr id="Accurately predicting the long-term behavior of chaotic systems is crucial for various applications such as climate modeling. However, achieving such predictions typically requires iterative computations over a dense spatiotemporal grid to account for the unstable nature of chaotic systems, which is expensive and impractical in many real-world situations. An alternative approach to such a full-resolved simulation is using a coarse grid and then correcting its errors through a \textit{closure model}, which approximates the overall information from fine scales not captured in the coarse-grid simulation. Recently, ML approaches have been used for closure modeling, but they typically require a large number of training samples from expensive fully-resolved simulations (FRS). In this work, we prove an even more fundamental limitation, i.e., the standard approach to learning closure models suffers from a large approximation error for generic problems, no matter how large the model is, and it stems from the non-uniqueness of the mapping. We propose an alternative end-to-end learning approach using a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) that overcomes this limitation by not using a closure model or a coarse-grid solver. We first train the PINO model on data from a coarse-grid solver and then fine-tune it with (a small amount of) FRS and physics-based losses on a fine grid. The discretization-free nature of neural operators means that they do not suffer from the restriction of a coarse grid that closure models face, and they can provably approximate the long-term statistics of chaotic systems. In our experiments, our PINO model achieves a 120x speedup compared to FRS with a relative error $\sim 5\%$. In contrast, the closure model coupled with a coarse-grid solver is $58$x slower than PINO while having a much higher error $\sim205\%$ when the closure model is trained on the same FRS dataset.">

As proof of concept, a minimal training dataset under the resource constraint problem of a Duffing oscillator with harmonic external forcing is provided as training data. Our results indicate that the RC not only learns to represent the system dynamics for the trained external forcing, but it also manages to provide qualitatively accurate and robust system response predictions for completely unknown \textit{multi-}parameter regimes outside the training data.

We introduce a coupled Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with two encoders to encode the full states and sparse observations in a consistent way guaranteed by a latent distribution matching and regularization as well as a consistent state reconstruction. With comparison to several methods, we demonstrate the higher accuracy, faster convergence, and higher efficiency of Latent-EnSF for two challenging applications with complex models in shallow water wave propagation and medium-range weather forecasting, for highly sparse observations in both space and time.">

However, these methods still are prone to scarcity problems where per-environment data is sparse or limited. Therefore, we propose a novel CoNDP (Context-Informed Neural ODE Processes) to achieve learning system dynamics from sparse observations across environments. It can fully use contextual information of each environment to better capture the intrinsic commonalities across environments and distinguishable differences among environments while modeling uncertainty of system evolution, producing more accurate predictions. Intensive experiments are conducted on five complex dynamical systems in various fields. Results show that the proposed CoNDP can achieve optimal results compared with common neural simulators and state-of-the-art cross-environmental models.">

        <tr id="Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a crucial but challenging task in many high-dimensional regression or learning problems to increase the confidence of a given predictor. We develop a new data-driven approach for UQ in regression that applies both to classical regression approaches such as the LASSO as well as to neural networks. One of the most notable UQ techniques is the debiased LASSO, which modifies the LASSO to allow for the construction of asymptotic confidence intervals by decomposing the estimation error into a Gaussian and an asymptotically vanishing bias component. However, in real-world problems with finite-dimensional data, the bias term is often too significant to be neglected, resulting in overly narrow confidence intervals. Our work rigorously addresses this issue and derives a data-driven adjustment that corrects the confidence intervals for a large class of predictors by estimating the means and variances of the bias terms from training data, exploiting high-dimensional concentration phenomena. This gives rise to non-asymptotic confidence intervals, which can help avoid overestimating uncertainty in critical applications such as MRI diagnosis. Importantly, our analysis extends beyond sparse regression to data-driven predictors like neural networks, enhancing the reliability of model-based deep learning. Our findings bridge the gap between established theory and the practical applicability of such debiased methods.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we propose a physics-informed learning-based Koopman modeling approach and present a Koopman-based self-tuning moving horizon estimation design for a class of nonlinear systems. Specifically, we train Koopman operators and two neural networks - the state lifting network and the noise characterization network - using both data and available physical information. The two neural networks account for the nonlinear lifting functions for Koopman modeling and describing system noise distributions, respectively. Accordingly, a stochastic linear Koopman model is established in the lifted space to forecast the dynamic behavior of the nonlinear system. Based on the Koopman model, a self-tuning linear moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme is developed. The weighting matrices of the MHE design are updated using the pre-trained noise characterization network at each sampling instant. The proposed estimation scheme is computationally efficient because only convex optimization is involved during online implementation, and updating the weighting matrices of the MHE scheme does not require re-training the neural networks. We verify the effectiveness and evaluate the performance of the proposed method via the application to a simulated chemical process.">

        <tr id="Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) represent a significant advancement at the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems, offering a continuous-time analog to discrete neural networks. Despite their promise, deploying neural ODEs in practical applications often encounters the challenge of stiffness, a condition where rapid variations in some components of the solution demand prohibitively small time steps for explicit solvers. This work addresses the stiffness issue when employing neural ODEs for model order reduction by introducing a suitable reparametrization in time. The considered map is data-driven and it is induced by the adaptive time-stepping of an implicit solver on a reference solution. We show the map produces a nonstiff system that can be cheaply solved with an explicit time integration scheme. The original, stiff, time dynamic is recovered by means of a map learnt by a neural network that connects the state space to the time reparametrization. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating improvements in efficiency for the neural ODE inference while maintaining robustness and accuracy. The neural network model also showcases good generalization properties for times beyond the training data.">

        <tr id="Complex dynamic systems are typically either modeled using expert knowledge in the form of differential equations, or via data-driven universal approximation models such as artificial neural networks (ANN). While the first approach has advantages with respect to interpretability, transparency, data-efficiency, and extrapolation, the second approach is able to learn completely unknown functional relations from data and may result in models that can be evaluated more efficiently. To combine the complementary advantages, universal differential equations (UDE) have been suggested, which replace unknown terms in the differential equations with ANN. These hybrid models allow to both encode prior domain knowledge such as first principles and to learn unknown mechanisms from data. Often, data for the training of UDE can only be obtained via costly experiments. We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for the planning of experiments and generation of data needed to train UDE. The number of weights in the embedded ANN usually leads to an overfitting of the regression problem. To make the OED problem tractable for optimization, we propose and compare dimension reduction methods that are based on lumping of weights and singular value decomposition of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), respectively. They result in lower-dimensional variational differential equations which are easier to solve and which yield regular FIM. Our numerical results showcase the advantages of OED for UDE, such as an increased data-efficiency and better extrapolation properties.">

        <tr id="Advection-dominated problems are commonly noticed in nature, engineering systems, and a wide range of industrial processes. For these problems, linear approximation methods (proper orthogonal decomposition and reduced basis method) are not suitable, as the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay is slow, leading to inefficient and inaccurate reduced order models. There are few non-linear approaches to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay. In this work, we use a neural-network shift augmented transformation technique, that employs automatic-shit detection and detects the optimal non-linear transformation of the full-order model solution manifold $\mathcal{M}$. We exploit a deep-learning framework to derive parameter-dependent bijective mapping between the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the transformed manifold $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$. It consists of two neural networks, 1) ShiftNet, to employ automatic-shift detection by learning the shift-operator, which finds the optimal shifts for numerous snapshots of the full-order solution manifold, to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay, and 2) InterpNet, which learns the reference configuration and can reconstruct the field values of the same, for each shifted grid distribution. We construct non-intrusive reduced order models on the resulting transformed linear subspaces and employ automatic-shift detection for predictions. We test our methodology on advection-dominated problems, such as 1D travelling waves, 2D isentropic convective vortex and 2D two-phase flow test cases. This work leads to the development of the complete NNsPOD-ROM algorithm for model reduction of advection-dominated problems, comprising both offline-online stages.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces a novel methodology for solving distributed-order fractional differential equations using a physics-informed machine learning framework. The core of this approach involves extending the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to approximate the unknown solutions of the governing equations during the training phase. By embedding the distributed-order functional equation into the SVR framework, we incorporate physical laws directly into the learning process. To further enhance computational efficiency, Gegenbauer orthogonal polynomials are employed as the kernel function, capitalizing on their fractional differentiation properties to streamline the problem formulation. Finally, the resulting optimization problem of SVR is addressed either as a quadratic programming problem or as a positive definite system in its dual form. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a series of numerical experiments on Caputo-based distributed-order fractional differential equations, encompassing both ordinary and partial derivatives.">

        <tr id="Nonlinear optimization (NOPT) is a meaningful tool for solving complex tasks in fields like engineering, economics, and operations research, among others. However, NOPT has problems when it comes to dealing with data variability and noisy input measurements that lead to incorrect solutions. Furthermore, nonlinear constraints may result in outcomes that are either infeasible or suboptimal, such as nonconvex optimization. This paper introduces a novel regularized physics-informed neural network (RPINN) framework as a new NOPT tool for both supervised and unsupervised data-driven scenarios. Our RPINN is threefold: By using custom activation functions and regularization penalties in an artificial neural network (ANN), RPINN can handle data variability and noisy inputs. Furthermore, it employs physics principles to construct the network architecture, computing the optimization variables based on network weights and learned features. In addition, it uses automatic differentiation training to make the system scalable and cut down on computation time through batch-based back-propagation. The test results for both supervised and unsupervised NOPT tasks show that our RPINN can provide solutions that are competitive compared to state-of-the-art solvers. In turn, the robustness of RPINN against noisy input measurements makes it particularly valuable in environments with fluctuating information. Specifically, we test a uniform mixture model and a gas-powered system as NOPT scenarios. Overall, with RPINN, its ANN-based foundation offers significant flexibility and scalability.">

Boyuan Chen and his co-authors proposed a neural network model that estimates the degrees of freedom and attempts to discover the state variables of a dynamical system. Despite its innovative approach, this baseline model lacks a connection to the physical principles governing the systems it analyzes, leading to unreliable state variables. This research proposes a method that leverages the physical characteristics of second-order Hamiltonian systems to constrain the baseline model.

        <tr id="Lifted linear predictor (LLP) is an artificial linear dynamical system designed to predict trajectories of a generally nonlinear dynamical system based on the current state (or measurements) and the input. The main benefit of the LLP is its potential ability to capture the nonlinear system's dynamics with precision superior to other linearization techniques, such as local linearization about the operation point. The idea of lifting is supported by the theory of Koopman Operators. For LLP identification, we focus on the data-driven method based on the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) algorithm. However, while the EDMD algorithm presents an extremely simple and efficient way to obtain the LLP, it can also yield poor results. In this paper, we present some less intuitive practical guidelines for data-driven identification of the LLPs, aiming at improving usability of LLPs for designing control. We support the guidelines with two motivating examples. The implementation of the examples are shared on a public repository.">

        <tr id="Non-stationary systems are found throughout the world, from climate patterns under the influence of variation in carbon dioxide concentration, to brain dynamics driven by ascending neuromodulation. Accordingly, there is a need for methods to analyze non-stationary processes, and yet most time-series analysis methods that are used in practice, on important problems across science and industry, make the simplifying assumption of stationarity. One important problem in the analysis of non-stationary systems is the problem class that we refer to as Parameter Inference from a Non-stationary Unknown Process (PINUP). Given an observed time series, this involves inferring the parameters that drive non-stationarity of the time series, without requiring knowledge or inference of a mathematical model of the underlying system. Here we review and unify a diverse literature of algorithms for PINUP. We formulate the problem, and categorize the various algorithmic contributions. This synthesis will allow researchers to identify gaps in the literature and will enable systematic comparisons of different methods. We also demonstrate that the most common systems that existing methods are tested on - notably the non-stationary Lorenz process and logistic map - are surprisingly easy to perform well on using simple statistical features like windowed mean and variance, undermining the practice of using good performance on these systems as evidence of algorithmic performance. We then identify more challenging problems that many existing methods perform poorly on and which can be used to drive methodological advances in the field. Our results unify disjoint scientific contributions to analyzing non-stationary systems and suggest new directions for progress on the PINUP problem and the broader study of non-stationary phenomena.">

        <tr id="Data from fluid flow measurements are typically sparse, noisy, and heterogeneous, often from mixed pressure and velocity measurements, resulting in incomplete datasets. In this paper, we develop a physics-constrained convolutional neural network, which is a deterministic tool, to reconstruct the full flow field from incomplete data. We explore three loss functions, both from machine learning literature and newly proposed: (i) the softly-constrained loss, which allows the prediction to take any value; (ii) the snapshot-enforced loss, which constrains the prediction at the sensor locations; and (iii) the mean-enforced loss, which constrains the mean of the prediction at the sensor locations. The proposed methods do not require the full flow field during training, making it suitable for reconstruction from incomplete data. We apply the method to reconstruct a laminar wake of a bluff body and a turbulent Kolmogorov flow. First, we assume that measurements are not noisy and reconstruct both the laminar wake and the Kolmogorov flow from sensors located at fewer than 1% of all grid points. The snapshot-enforced loss reduces the reconstruction error of the Kolmogorov flow by approximately 25% compared to the softly-constrained loss. Second, we assume that measurements are noisy and propose the mean-enforced loss to reconstruct the laminar wake and the Kolmogorov flow at three different signal-to-noise ratios. We find that, across the ratios tested, the loss functions with harder constraints are more robust to both the random initialization of the networks and the noise levels in the measurements. At high noise levels, the mean-enforced loss can recover the instantaneous snapshots accurately, making it the suitable choice when reconstructing flows from data corrupted with an unknown amount of noise. The proposed method opens opportunities for physical flow reconstruction from sparse, noisy data.">

Traditional kernel-based methods, despite their theoretical soundness and numerical efficiency, frequently struggle with selecting optimal base kernels and parameter tuning, especially with gradient-based methods prone to local optima. KSOS mitigates these issues by leveraging a global optimization framework with kernel-based surrogate functions, thereby achieving more reliable and precise learning of dynamical systems. Through comprehensive numerical experiments on the Logistic Map, Henon Map, and Lorentz System, KSOS is shown to consistently outperform gradient descent in minimizing the relative-$\rho$ metric and improving kernel accuracy. These results highlight KSOS's effectiveness in predicting the behavior of chaotic dynamical systems, demonstrating its capability to adapt kernels to underlying dynamics and enhance the robustness and predictive power of kernel-based approaches, making it a valuable asset for time series analysis in various scientific fields.">
