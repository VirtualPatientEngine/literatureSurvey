        <tr id="Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.">

        <tr id="In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different time points. Here, we introduce RAINDROP, a graph neural network that embeds irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. RAINDROP represents every sample as a separate sensor graph and models time-varying dependencies between sensors with a novel message passing operator. It estimates the latent sensor graph structure and leverages the structure together with nearby observations to predict misaligned readouts. This model can be interpreted as a graph neural network that sends messages over graphs that are optimized for capturing time-varying dependencies among sensors. We use RAINDROP to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. RAINDROP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.4% (absolute F1-score points), including techniques that deal with irregular sampling using fixed discretization and set functions. RAINDROP shows superiority in diverse setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have shown to be effective in time series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global) inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate predictions.">

        <tr id="Outstanding achievements of graph neural networks for spatiotemporal time series analysis show that relational constraints introduce an effective inductive bias into neural forecasting architectures. Often, however, the relational information characterizing the underlying data-generating process is unavailable and the practitioner is left with the problem of inferring from data which relational graph to use in the subsequent processing stages. We propose novel, principled - yet practical - probabilistic score-based methods that learn the relational dependencies as distributions over graphs while maximizing end-to-end the performance at task. The proposed graph learning framework is based on consolidated variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo score-based gradient estimation, is theoretically grounded, and, as we show, effective in practice. In this paper, we focus on the time series forecasting problem and show that, by tailoring the gradient estimators to the graph learning problem, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance while controlling the sparsity of the learned graph and the computational scalability. We empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that the proposed solution can be used as a stand-alone graph identification procedure as well as a graph learning component of an end-to-end forecasting architecture.">

        <tr id="Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic) graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed, recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions.">

        <tr id="By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.">

        <tr id="Attention mechanisms have been widely used to capture long-range dependencies among nodes in Graph Transformers. Bottlenecked by the quadratic computational cost, attention mechanisms fail to scale in large graphs. Recent improvements in computational efficiency are mainly achieved by attention sparsification with random or heuristic-based graph subsampling, which falls short in data-dependent context reasoning. State space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained prominence for their effectiveness and efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, adapting SSMs to non-sequential graph data presents a notable challenge. In this work, we introduce Graph-Mamba, the first attempt to enhance long-range context modeling in graph networks by integrating a Mamba block with the input-dependent node selection mechanism. Specifically, we formulate graph-centric node prioritization and permutation strategies to enhance context-aware reasoning, leading to a substantial improvement in predictive performance. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-range graph prediction tasks, with a fraction of the computational cost in both FLOPs and GPU memory consumption.

        <tr id="Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.">

        <tr id="Large pre-trained models excel in zero/few-shot learning for language and vision tasks but face challenges in multivariate time series (TS) forecasting due to diverse data characteristics. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1.

        <tr id="Pre-training on time series poses a unique challenge due to the potential mismatch between pre-training and target domains, such as shifts in temporal dynamics, fast-evolving trends, and long-range and short-cyclic effects, which can lead to poor downstream performance. While domain adaptation methods can mitigate these shifts, most methods need examples directly from the target domain, making them suboptimal for pre-training. To address this challenge, methods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and be capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training. Relative to other modalities, in time series, we expect that time-based and frequency-based representations of the same example are located close together in the time-frequency space. To this end, we posit that time-frequency consistency (TF-C) -- embedding a time-based neighborhood of an example close to its frequency-based neighborhood -- is desirable for pre-training. Motivated by TF-C, we define a decomposable pre-training model, where the self-supervised signal is provided by the distance between time and frequency components, each individually trained by contrastive estimation. We evaluate the new method on eight datasets, including electrodiagnostic testing, human activity recognition, mechanical fault detection, and physical status monitoring. Experiments against eight state-of-the-art methods show that TF-C outperforms baselines by 15.4% (F1 score) on average in one-to-one settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model on EMG data) and by 8.4% (precision) in challenging one-to-many settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model for either hand-gesture recognition or mechanical fault prediction), reflecting the breadth of scenarios that arise in real-world applications.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that Raincoat can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.">

The proposed AZ-test can be intended as a spatio-temporal extension of traditional tests designed for system identiﬁcation to graph signals. The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes over time, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as it is the case in many application scenarios like sensor and transportation networks. The asymptotic distribution of the designed test can be derived under the null hypothesis without assuming identically distributed data. We show the effectiveness of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and illustrate how it can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graph stream.">

The manuscript aims, for the first time, at filling this gap by matching state-space modeling and spatio-temporal data where the relational information, say the functional graph capturing latent dependencies, is learned directly from data and is allowed to change over time. Within a probabilistic formulation that accounts for the uncertainty in the data-generating process, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn the state-space model end-to-end on a downstream task.

        <tr id="The challenge of effectively learning inter-series correlations for multivariate time series forecasting remains a substantial and unresolved problem. Traditional deep learning models, which are largely dependent on the Transformer paradigm for modeling long sequences, often fail to integrate information from multiple time series into a coherent and universally applicable model. To bridge this gap, our paper presents ForecastGrapher, a framework reconceptualizes multivariate time series forecasting as a node regression task, providing a unique avenue for capturing the intricate temporal dynamics and inter-series correlations. Our approach is underpinned by three pivotal steps: firstly, generating custom node embeddings to reflect the temporal variations within each series; secondly, constructing an adaptive adjacency matrix to encode the inter-series correlations; and thirdly, augmenting the GNNs' expressive power by diversifying the node feature distribution. To enhance this expressive power, we introduce the Group Feature Convolution GNN (GFC-GNN). This model employs a learnable scaler to segment node features into multiple groups and applies one-dimensional convolutions with different kernel lengths to each group prior to the aggregation phase. Consequently, the GFC-GNN method enriches the diversity of node feature distribution in a fully end-to-end fashion. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that ForecastGrapher surpasses strong baselines and leading published techniques in the domain of multivariate time series forecasting.">

        <tr id="The widespread adoption of scalable mobile sensing has led to large amounts of time series data for real-world applications. A fundamental application is multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which aims to predict future time series values based on historical observations. Existing MTSF methods suffer from limited parameterization and small-scale training data. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced in time series, which achieve promising forecasting performance but incur heavy computational costs. To solve these challenges, we propose TimeCMA, an LLM-empowered framework for time series forecasting with cross-modality alignment. We design a dual-modality encoding module with two branches, where the time series encoding branch extracts relatively low-quality yet pure embeddings of time series through an inverted Transformer. In addition, the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series as prompts to obtain high-quality yet entangled prompt embeddings via a Pre-trained LLM. Then, we design a cross-modality alignment module to retrieve high-quality and pure time series embeddings from the prompt embeddings. Moreover, we develop a time series forecasting module to decode the aligned embeddings while capturing dependencies among multiple variables for forecasting. Notably, we tailor the prompt to encode sufficient temporal information into a last token and design the last token embedding storage to reduce computational costs. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.">

Real-world time series data often include noise, outliers, and missing values, making accurate forecasting challenging. Traditional methods model point-to-point relationships, which limits their ability to capture complex temporal patterns and increases their susceptibility to noise.To address these issues, we introduce the WindowMixer model, built on an all-MLP framework. WindowMixer leverages the continuous nature of time series by examining temporal variations from a window-based perspective. It decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components, handling them individually. For trends, a fully connected (FC) layer makes predictions. For seasonal components, time windows are projected to produce window tokens, processed by Intra-Window-Mixer and Inter-Window-Mixer modules. The Intra-Window-Mixer models relationships within each window, while the Inter-Window-Mixer models relationships between windows. This approach captures intricate patterns and long-range dependencies in the data.Experiments show WindowMixer consistently outperforms existing methods in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.">

        <tr id="Time series imputation plays a crucial role in various real-world systems and has been extensively explored. Models for time series imputation often require specialization, necessitating distinct designs for different domains and missing patterns. In this study, we introduce NuwaTS, a framework to repurpose Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for general time series imputation. Once trained, this model can be applied to imputation tasks on incomplete time series from any domain with any missing patterns. We begin by devising specific embeddings for each sub-series patch of the incomplete time series. These embeddings encapsulate information about the patch itself, the missing data patterns within the patch, and the patch's statistical characteristics. To enhance the model's adaptability to different missing patterns, we propose a contrastive learning approach to make representations of the same patch more similar across different missing patterns. By combining this contrastive loss with the missing data imputation task, we train PLMs to obtain a one-for-all imputation model. Furthermore, we utilize a plug-and-play layer-wise fine-tuning approach to train domain-specific models. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging a dataset of over seventeen million time series from diverse domains, we obtain a one-for-all imputation model which outperforms existing domain-specific models across various datasets and missing patterns. Additionally, we find that NuwaTS can be generalized to other time series tasks such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.">

While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained significant traction in the forecasting domain, especially for their capacity to simultaneously account for intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series relationships. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical GNN (DeepHGNN) framework, explicitly designed for forecasting in complex hierarchical structures. The uniqueness of DeepHGNN lies in its innovative graph-based hierarchical interpolation and an end-to-end reconciliation mechanism. This approach ensures forecast accuracy and coherence across various hierarchical levels while sharing signals across them, addressing a key challenge in hierarchical forecasting. A critical insight in hierarchical time series is the variance in forecastability across levels, with upper levels typically presenting more predictable components. DeepHGNN capitalizes on this insight by pooling and leveraging knowledge from all hierarchy levels, thereby enhancing the overall forecast accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation set against several state-of-the-art models confirm the superior performance of DeepHGNN. This research not only demonstrates DeepHGNN's effectiveness in achieving significantly improved forecast accuracy but also contributes to the understanding of graph-based methods in hierarchical time series forecasting.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based models have emerged as powerful tools for multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, existing Transformer models often fall short of capturing both intricate dependencies across variate and temporal dimensions in MTS data. Some recent models are proposed to separately capture variate and temporal dependencies through either two sequential or parallel attention mechanisms. However, these methods cannot directly and explicitly learn the intricate inter-series and intra-series dependencies. In this work, we first demonstrate that these dependencies are very important as they usually exist in real-world data. To directly model these dependencies, we propose a transformer-based model UniTST containing a unified attention mechanism on the flattened patch tokens. Additionally, we add a dispatcher module which reduces the complexity and makes the model feasible for a potentially large number of variates. Although our proposed model employs a simple architecture, it offers compelling performance as shown in our extensive experiments on several datasets for time series forecasting.">

Recent findings have indicated that simpler linear models might outperform complex Transformer-based approaches, highlighting the potential for more streamlined architectures.

To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional Transformer framework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention mechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as queries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term forecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory usage.

Recent works model the relations between time-series as graphs and have shown that propagating information over the relation graph can improve time series forecasting. However, in many cases, relational information is not available or is noisy and reliable. Moreover, most works ignore the underlying uncertainty of time-series both for structure learning and deriving the forecasts resulting in the structure not capturing the uncertainty resulting in forecast distributions with poor uncertainty estimates. We tackle this challenge and introduce STOIC, that leverages stochastic correlations between time-series to learn underlying structure between time-series and to provide well-calibrated and accurate forecasts. Over a wide-range of benchmark datasets STOIC provides around 16% more accurate and 14% better-calibrated forecasts. STOIC also shows better adaptation to noise in data during inference and captures important and useful relational information in various benchmarks.">

Enabling general time series forecasting faces two challenges: how to obtain unified representations from multi-domian time series data, and how to capture domain-specific features from time series data across various domains for adaptive transfer in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a Register Assisted General Time Series Forecasting Model with Decomposed Frequency Learning (ROSE), a novel pre-trained model for time series forecasting. ROSE employs Decomposed Frequency Learning for the pre-training task, which decomposes coupled semantic and periodic information in time series with frequency-based masking and reconstruction to obtain unified representations across domains. We also equip ROSE with a Time Series Register, which learns to generate a register codebook to capture domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances domain-adaptive transfer by selecting related register tokens on downstream tasks. After pre-training on large-scale time series data, ROSE achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 8 real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, even in few-shot scenarios, it demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods trained with full data.">

In this study, we analyze the limitations of current Mamba in LTSF and propose four targeted improvements, leading to MambaTS. We first introduce variable scan along time to arrange the historical information of all the variables together.

We further incorporate a dropout mechanism for selective parameters of TMB to mitigate model overfitting. Moreover, we tackle the issue of variable scan order sensitivity by introducing variable permutation training. We further propose variable-aware scan along time to dynamically discover variable relationships during training and decode the optimal variable scan order by solving the shortest path visiting all nodes problem during inference.

To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template.

Particularly, the emergence of pre-trained LLMs-based temporal works, compared to previous deep model approaches, has demonstrated superior generalization and robustness, showcasing the potential of generative pre-trained paradigms as foundation models for time series. However, those LLMs-based works mainly focus on cross-modal research, i.e., leveraging the language capabilities of LLMs in time series contexts. Although they have achieved impressive performance, there still exist the issues of concept drift caused by differences in data distribution and inflexibility caused by misalignment of dimensions. To this end, inspired by recent work on LVMs, we reconsider the paradigm of time series modeling. In this paper, we comprehensively explore, for the first time, the effectiveness and superiority of the Generative Pre-trained Diffusion (GPD) paradigm in real-world multivariate time series forecasting (TSF). Specifically, to mitigate performance bias introduced by sophisticated networks, we propose a straightforward MLP diffusion network for unconditional modeling of time series. Then we employ a zero-shot and tuning-free method to predict (generate) future data using historical data as prompts. The GPD paradigm is established on the time series modality, effectively preventing the phenomenon of concept drift, and enabling flexible forecasting of arbitrary lengths. We demonstrate that the GPD paradigm achieves comprehensive performance and generalization comparable to current SOTA LLM-based and deep model paradigms on mainstream benchmarks and various TSF tasks. Extensive experiments validate the potential of the GPD paradigm and its assistance in future related research.">

We regard the input time series data as a grid, where the $x$-axis represents the time steps and the $y$-axis represents the variates. A vertical slicing of this grid combines the variates at each time step into a \textit{time token}, while a horizontal slicing embeds the individual series across all time steps into a \textit{variate token}. Correspondingly, a \textit{horizontal attention mechanism} focuses on time tokens to comprehend the correlations between data at various time steps, while a \textit{vertical}, variate-aware \textit{attention} is employed to grasp multivariate correlations. This combination enables efficient processing of information across both time and variate dimensions, thereby enhancing the model's analytical strength. % We also integrate the patch technique, segmenting time tokens into subseries-level patches, ensuring that local semantic information is retained in the embedding. The GridTST model consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across various real-world datasets.">

        <tr id="Time series analysis remains a major challenge due to its sparse characteristics, high dimensionality, and inconsistent data quality. Recent advancements in transformer-based techniques have enhanced capabilities in forecasting and imputation; however, these methods are still resource-heavy, lack adaptability, and face difficulties in integrating both local and global attributes of time series. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new architectural concept for time series analysis based on introspection. Central to this concept is the self-supervised pretraining of Time Series Representation Models (TSRMs), which once learned can be easily tailored and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, in an automated and resource-efficient manner. Our architecture is equipped with a flexible and hierarchical representation learning process, which is robust against missing data and outliers. It can capture and learn both local and global features of the structure, semantics, and crucial patterns of a given time series category, such as heart rate data. Our learned time series representation models can be efficiently adapted to a specific task, such as forecasting or imputation, without manual intervention. Furthermore, our architecture's design supports explainability by highlighting the significance of each input value for the task at hand. Our empirical study using four benchmark datasets shows that, compared to investigated state-of-the-art baseline methods, our architecture improves imputation and forecasting errors by up to 90.34% and 71.54%, respectively, while reducing the required trainable parameters by up to 92.43%.

        <tr id="In recent years, significant progress has been made in multivariate time series forecasting using Linear-based, Transformer-based, and Convolution-based models. However, these approaches face notable limitations: linear forecasters struggle with representation capacities, attention mechanisms suffer from quadratic complexity, and convolutional models have a restricted receptive field. These constraints impede their effectiveness in modeling complex time series, particularly those with numerous variables. Additionally, many models adopt the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy, treating multivariate time series as uncorrelated univariate series while ignoring their correlations. For models considering inter-channel relationships, whether through the self-attention mechanism, linear combination, or convolution, they all incur high computational costs and focus solely on weighted summation relationships, neglecting potential proportional relationships between channels. In this work, we address these issues by leveraging the newly introduced state space model and propose \textbf{C-Mamba}, a novel approach that captures cross-channel dependencies while maintaining linear complexity without losing the global receptive field. Our model consists of two key components: (i) channel mixup, where two channels are mixed to enhance the training sets; (ii) channel attention enhanced patch-wise Mamba encoder that leverages the ability of the state space models to capture cross-time dependencies and models correlations between channels by mining their weight relationships. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven real-world time series datasets. Moreover, the proposed mixup and attention strategy exhibits strong generalizability across other frameworks.">

Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configurations.

        <tr id="Pretraining plays a pivotal role in acquiring generalized knowledge from large-scale data, achieving remarkable successes as evidenced by large models in CV and NLP. However, progress in the graph domain remains limited due to fundamental challenges such as feature heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity. Recently, increasing efforts have been made to enhance node feature quality with Large Language Models (LLMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), demonstrating superiority to traditional bag-of-words or word2vec techniques. These high-quality node features reduce the previously critical role of graph structure, resulting in a modest performance gap between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and structure-agnostic Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Motivated by this, we introduce a feature-centric pretraining perspective by treating graph structure as a prior and leveraging the rich, unified feature space to learn refined interaction patterns that generalizes across graphs. Our framework, Graph Sequence Pretraining with Transformer (GSPT), samples node contexts through random walks and employs masked feature reconstruction to capture pairwise proximity in the LLM-unified feature space using a standard Transformer. By utilizing unified text representations rather than varying structures, our framework achieves significantly better transferability among graphs within the same domain. GSPT can be easily adapted to both node classification and link prediction, demonstrating promising empirical success on various datasets.">

This method aligns more closely with the inherent in-context mechanisms, and is more parameter-efficient without the need of using pre-trained LLM parameters.

In this work, we present Graph-Enhanced Contextual Operator (GECO), a scalable and effective alternative to GTs that leverages neighborhood propagation and global convolutions to effectively capture local and global dependencies in quasilinear time. Our study on synthetic datasets reveals that GECO reaches 169x speedup on a graph with 2M nodes w.r.t. optimized attention. Further evaluations on diverse range of benchmarks showcase that GECO scales to large graphs where traditional GTs often face memory and time limitations. Notably, GECO consistently achieves comparable or superior quality compared to baselines, improving the SOTA up to 4.5%, and offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale graph learning.">

        <tr id="Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has been extensively applied across diverse domains, such as weather prediction and energy consumption. However, current studies still rely on the vanilla point-wise self-attention mechanism to capture cross-variable dependencies, which is inadequate in extracting the intricate cross-correlation implied between variables. To fill this gap, we propose Variable Correlation Transformer (VCformer), which utilizes Variable Correlation Attention (VCA) module to mine the correlations among variables. Specifically, based on the stochastic process theory, VCA calculates and integrates the cross-correlation scores corresponding to different lags between queries and keys, thereby enhancing its ability to uncover multivariate relationships. Additionally, inspired by Koopman dynamics theory, we also develop Koopman Temporal Detector (KTD) to better address the non-stationarity in time series. The two key components enable VCformer to extract both multivariate correlations and temporal dependencies. Our extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VCformer, achieving top-tier performance compared to other state-of-the-art baseline models.

To address this limitation, we present DeformTime, a neural network architecture that attempts to capture correlated temporal patterns from the input space, and hence, improve forecasting accuracy. It deploys two core operations performed by deformable attention blocks (DABs): learning dependencies across variables from different time steps (variable DAB), and preserving temporal dependencies in data from previous time steps (temporal DAB). Input data transformation is explicitly designed to enhance learning from the deformed series of information while passing through a DAB. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 MTS data sets, using previously established benchmarks as well as challenging infectious disease modelling tasks with more exogenous variables. The results demonstrate that DeformTime improves accuracy against previous competitive methods across the vast majority of MTS forecasting tasks, reducing the mean absolute error by 10% on average.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting is widely used in extensive applications, such as traffic planning and weather forecasting. However, real-world time series usually present intricate temporal variations, making forecasting extremely challenging. Going beyond the mainstream paradigms of plain decomposition and multiperiodicity analysis, we analyze temporal variations in a novel view of multiscale-mixing, which is based on an intuitive but important observation that time series present distinct patterns in different sampling scales. The microscopic and the macroscopic information are reflected in fine and coarse scales respectively, and thereby complex variations can be inherently disentangled. Based on this observation, we propose TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM) blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases. Concretely, PDM applies the decomposition to multiscale series and further mixes the decomposed seasonal and trend components in fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions separately, which successively aggregates the microscopic seasonal and macroscopic trend information. FMM further ensembles multiple predictors to utilize complementary forecasting capabilities in multiscale observations. Consequently, TimeMixer is able to achieve consistent state-of-the-art performances in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency.">

However, real-world time series exhibit pronounced non-stationary distribution characteristics. These characteristics are not solely limited to time-varying statistical properties highlighted by non-stationary Transformer but also encompass three key aspects: nested periodicity, absence of periodic distributions, and hysteresis among time variables. In this paper, we begin by validating this theory through wavelet analysis and propose the Transformer-based TwinS model, which consists of three modules to address the non-stationary periodic distributions: Wavelet Convolution, Period-Aware Attention, and Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP. Specifically, The Wavelet Convolution models nested periods by scaling the convolution kernel size like wavelet transform. The Period-Aware Attention guides attention computation by generating period relevance scores through a convolutional sub-network. The Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP captures the overall relationships between time series through channel-time mixing learning. TwinS achieves SOTA performance compared to mainstream TS models, with a maximum improvement in MSE of 25.8\% over PatchTST.">

Unfortunately, the majority of current time series prediction models fail to simultaneously learn the correlations of multivariate time series at multi-grained levels, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Multi-Grained Correlations-based Prediction (MGCP) Network, which simultaneously considers the correlations at three granularity levels to enhance prediction performance. Specifically, MGCP utilizes Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators and Graph Convolutional Networks to learn the global spatiotemporal correlations and inter-series correlations, enabling the extraction of potential features from multivariate time series at fine-grained and medium-grained levels. Additionally, MGCP employs adversarial training with an attention mechanism-based predictor and conditional discriminator to optimize prediction results at coarse-grained level, ensuring high fidelity between the generated forecast results and the actual data distribution. Finally, we compare MGCP with several state-of-the-art time series prediction algorithms on real-world benchmark datasets, and our results demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the proposed model.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have advanced spatiotemporal forecasting by leveraging relational inductive biases among sensors (or any other measuring scheme) represented as nodes in a graph. However, current methods often rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), leading to increased runtimes and memory use. Moreover, these methods typically operate within 1-hop neighborhoods, exacerbating the reduction of the receptive field. Causal Graph Processes (CGPs) offer an alternative, using graph filters instead of MLP layers to reduce parameters and minimize memory consumption. This paper introduces the Causal Graph Process Neural Network (CGProNet), a non-linear model combining CGPs and GNNs for spatiotemporal forecasting. CGProNet employs higher-order graph filters, optimizing the model with fewer parameters, reducing memory usage, and improving runtime efficiency. We present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental stability analysis, highlighting key aspects of CGProNet. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate CGProNet's superior efficiency, minimizing memory and time requirements while maintaining competitive forecasting performance.">

        <tr id="Transformer architectures have shown promising results in time series processing. However, despite recent advances in subquadratic attention mechanisms or state-space models, processing very long sequences still imposes significant computational requirements. Token merging, which involves replacing multiple tokens with a single one calculated as their linear combination, has shown to considerably improve the throughput of vision transformer architectures while maintaining accuracy. In this work, we go beyond computer vision and perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both time series transformers and state-space models. To effectively scale token merging to long sequences, we introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, adjusting the computational complexity from linear to quadratic based on the neighborhood size. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that token merging offers substantial computational benefits with minimal impact on accuracy across various models and datasets. On the recently proposed Chronos foundation model, we achieve accelerations up to 5400% with only minor accuracy degradations.">

        <tr id="Time Series Forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as industrial equipment maintenance, meteorology, energy consumption, traffic flow and financial investment. However, despite their considerable advantages over traditional statistical approaches, current deep learning-based predictive models often exhibit a significant deviation between their forecasting outcomes and the ground truth. This discrepancy is largely due to an insufficient emphasis on extracting the sequence's latent information, particularly its global information within the frequency domain and the relationship between different variables. To address this issue, we propose a novel model Frequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons, which decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components using a multi-scale sequence adaptive decomposition and fusion architecture, and processes them separately. FAITH utilizes Frequency Channel feature Extraction Module and Frequency Temporal feature Extraction Module to capture inter-channel relationships and temporal global information in the sequence, significantly improving its ability to handle long-term dependencies and complex patterns. Furthermore, FAITH achieves theoretically linear complexity by modifying the time-frequency domain transformation method, effectively reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks for long-term forecasting and 3 benchmarks for short-term forecasting demonstrate that FAITH outperforms existing models in many fields, such as electricity, weather and traffic, proving its effectiveness and superiority both in long-term and short-term time series forecasting tasks.

        <tr id="Machine learning on graphs has recently found extensive applications across domains. However, the commonly used Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) suffer from limited expressive power and struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Graph transformers offer a strong alternative due to their global attention mechanism, but they come with great computational overheads, especially for large graphs. In recent years, State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a compelling approach to replace full attention in transformers to model sequential data. It blends the strengths of RNNs and CNNs, offering a) efficient computation, b) the ability to capture long-range dependencies, and c) good generalization across sequences of various lengths. However, extending SSMs to graph-structured data presents unique challenges due to the lack of canonical node ordering in graphs. In this work, we propose Graph State Space Convolution (GSSC) as a principled extension of SSMs to graph-structured data. By leveraging global permutation-equivariant set aggregation and factorizable graph kernels that rely on relative node distances as the convolution kernels, GSSC preserves all three advantages of SSMs. We demonstrate the provably stronger expressiveness of GSSC than MPNNs in counting graph substructures and show its effectiveness across 10 real-world, widely used benchmark datasets, where GSSC achieves best results on 7 out of 10 datasets with all significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art baselines and second-best results on the other 3 datasets. Our findings highlight the potential of GSSC as a powerful and scalable model for graph machine learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/GSSC.">

The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.">

To harness the strengths of both domains in capturing local and global dependencies, we propose the Frequency and Time Domain Mixer (FTMixer). To exploit the global characteristics of the frequency domain, we introduce the Frequency Channel Convolution (FCC) module, designed to capture global inter-series dependencies. Inspired by the windowing concept in frequency domain transformations, we present the Windowing Frequency Convolution (WFC) module to capture local dependencies. The WFC module first applies frequency transformation within each window, followed by convolution across windows. Furthermore, to better capture these local dependencies, we employ channel-independent scheme to mix the time domain and frequency domain patches. Notably, FTMixer employs the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) with real numbers instead of the complex-number-based Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), enabling direct utilization of modern deep learning operators in the frequency domain. Extensive experimental results across seven real-world long-term time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of FTMixer, in terms of both forecasting performance and computational efficiency.">

Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have gradually become the theme of MTSF model as their powerful capability in mining spatial-temporal dependencies, but almost of them heavily rely on the assumption of historical data integrity. In reality, due to factors such as data collector failures and time-consuming repairment, it is extremely challenging to collect the whole historical observations without missing any variable. In this case, STGNNs can only utilize a subset of normal variables and easily suffer from the incorrect spatial-temporal dependency modeling issue, resulting in the degradation of their forecasting performance. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Interpolation Attention Recursive Network (named GinAR) to precisely model the spatial-temporal dependencies over the limited collected data for forecasting. In GinAR, it consists of two key components, that is, interpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution to take place of the fully connected layer of simple recursive units, and thus are capable of recovering all missing variables and reconstructing the correct spatial-temporal dependencies for recursively modeling of multivariate time series data, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GinAR outperforms 11 SOTA baselines, and even when 90% of variables are missing, it can still accurately predict the future values of all variables.">

        <tr id="Tabular data is ubiquitous in many real-life systems. In particular, time-dependent tabular data, where rows are chronologically related, is typically used for recording historical events, e.g., financial transactions, healthcare records, or stock history. Recently, hierarchical variants of the attention mechanism of transformer architectures have been used to model tabular time-series data. At first, rows (or columns) are encoded separately by computing attention between their fields. Subsequently, encoded rows (or columns) are attended to one another to model the entire tabular time-series. While efficient, this approach constrains the attention granularity and limits its ability to learn patterns at the field-level across separate rows, or columns. We take a first step to address this gap by proposing Fieldy, a fine-grained hierarchical model that contextualizes fields at both the row and column levels. We compare our proposal against state of the art models on regression and classification tasks using public tabular time-series datasets. Our results show that combining row-wise and column-wise attention improves performance without increasing model size. Code and data are available at https://github.com/raphaaal/fieldy.">

To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.">

        <tr id="Graph pre-training has been concentrated on graph-level on small graphs (e.g., molecular graphs) or learning node representations on a fixed graph. Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Specifically, we design a flexible and scalable graph transformer as the backbone network. Meanwhile, based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other one for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our framework can perform pre-training on real-world web-scale graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and generalizes effectively to unseen new graphs with different downstream tasks. We further conduct experiments on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset, which consists of 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both industrial datasets and public datasets, while also enjoying scalability and efficiency.">

        <tr id="Message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), while excelling at capturing local relationships, often struggle with long-range dependencies on graphs. Conversely, graph transformers (GTs) enable information exchange between all nodes but oversimplify the graph structure by treating them as a set of fixed-length vectors. This work proposes a novel architecture, NeuralWalker, that overcomes the limitations of both methods by combining random walks with message passing. NeuralWalker achieves this by treating random walks as sequences, allowing for the application of recent advances in sequence models in order to capture long-range dependencies within these walks. Based on this concept, we propose a framework that offers (1) more expressive graph representations through random walk sequences, (2) the ability to utilize any sequence model for capturing long-range dependencies, and (3) the flexibility by integrating various GNN and GT architectures. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuralWalker achieves significant performance improvements on 19 graph and node benchmark datasets, notably outperforming existing methods by up to 13% on the PascalVoc-SP and COCO-SP datasets.

        <tr id="Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority within a graph, has garnered significant attention. However, current GAD methods necessitate training specific to each dataset, resulting in high training costs, substantial data requirements, and limited generalizability when being applied to new datasets and domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes ARC, a generalist GAD approach that enables a ``one-for-all'' GAD model to detect anomalies across various graph datasets on-the-fly. Equipped with in-context learning, ARC can directly extract dataset-specific patterns from the target dataset using few-shot normal samples at the inference stage, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning on the target dataset. ARC comprises three components that are well-crafted for capturing universal graph anomaly patterns: 1) smoothness-based feature Alignment module that unifies the features of different datasets into a common and anomaly-sensitive space; 2) ego-neighbor Residual graph encoder that learns abnormality-related node embeddings; and 3) cross-attentive in-Context anomaly scoring module that predicts node abnormality by leveraging few-shot normal samples. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets from various domains demonstrate the superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and generalizability of ARC.">

        <tr id="Modeling multivariate time series is a well-established problem with a wide range of applications from healthcare to financial markets. Traditional State Space Models (SSMs) are classical approaches for univariate time series modeling due to their simplicity and expressive power to represent linear dependencies. They, however, have fundamentally limited expressive power to capture non-linear dependencies, are slow in practice, and fail to model the inter-variate information flow. Despite recent attempts to improve the expressive power of SSMs by using deep structured SSMs, the existing methods are either limited to univariate time series, fail to model complex patterns (e.g., seasonal patterns), fail to dynamically model the dependencies of variate and time dimensions, and/or are input-independent. We present Chimera that uses two input-dependent 2-D SSM heads with different discretization processes to learn long-term progression and seasonal patterns. To improve the efficiency of complex 2D recurrence, we present a fast training using a new 2-dimensional parallel selective scan. We further present and discuss 2-dimensional Mamba and Mamba-2 as the spacial cases of our 2D SSM. Our experimental evaluation shows the superior performance of Chimera on extensive and diverse benchmarks, including ECG and speech time series classification, long-term and short-term time series forecasting, and time series anomaly detection.">

        <tr id="Time series data in real-world scenarios contain a substantial amount of nonlinear information, which significantly interferes with the training process of models, leading to decreased prediction performance. Therefore, during the time series forecasting process, extracting the local and global time series patterns and understanding the potential nonlinear features among different time observations are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information at different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture potential nonlinear features among time observations. Building upon this, we propose ACNet, an adaptive convolutional network designed to effectively model the local and global temporal dependencies and the nonlinear features between observations in multivariate time series. Specifically, by extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, we capture both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed nonlinear feature adaptive extraction module captures the nonlinear features among different time observations in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ACNet across twelve real-world datasets. The results indicate that ACNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks with favorable runtime efficiency.">

Various approaches have been introduced to time series analysis, including both statistical approaches and deep neural networks. Although neural network approaches have illustrated stronger ability of representation than statistical methods, they struggle to provide sufficient interpretablility, and can be too complicated to optimize. In this paper, we present WEITS, a frequency-aware deep learning framework that is highly interpretable and computationally efficient. Through multi-level wavelet decomposition, WEITS novelly infuses frequency analysis into a highly deep learning framework. Combined with a forward-backward residual architecture, it enjoys both high representation capability and statistical interpretability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated competitive performance of our model, along with its additional advantage of high computation efficiency. Furthermore, WEITS provides a general framework that can always seamlessly integrate with state-of-the-art approaches for time series forecast.">

        <tr id="Existing approaches for learning representations of time-series keep the temporal arrangement of the time-steps intact with the presumption that the original order is the most optimal for learning. However, non-adjacent sections of real-world time-series may have strong dependencies. Accordingly we raise the question: Is there an alternative arrangement for time-series which could enable more effective representation learning? To address this, we propose a simple plug-and-play mechanism called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3) designed to improve time-series representation learning of existing models. S3 works by creating non-overlapping segments from the original sequence and shuffling them in a learned manner that is the most optimal for the task at hand. It then re-attaches the shuffled segments back together and performs a learned weighted sum with the original input to capture both the newly shuffled sequence along with the original sequence. S3 is modular and can be stacked to create various degrees of granularity, and can be added to many forms of neural architectures including CNNs or Transformers with negligible computation overhead. Through extensive experiments on several datasets and state-of-the-art baselines, we show that incorporating S3 results in significant improvements for the tasks of time-series classification and forecasting, improving performance on certain datasets by up to 68\%. We also show that S3 makes the learning more stable with a smoother training loss curve and loss landscape compared to the original baseline.

        <tr id="Temporal graphs are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios, such as social network, trade and transportation. Predicting dynamic links between nodes in a temporal graph is of vital importance. Traditional methods usually leverage the temporal neighborhood of interaction history to generate node embeddings first and then aggregate the source and target node embeddings to predict the link. However, such methods focus on learning individual node representations, but overlook the pairwise representation learning nature of link prediction and fail to capture the important pairwise features of links such as common neighbors (CN). Motivated by the success of Neural Common Neighbor (NCN) for static graph link prediction, we propose TNCN, a temporal version of NCN for link prediction in temporal graphs. TNCN dynamically updates a temporal neighbor dictionary for each node, and utilizes multi-hop common neighbors between the source and target node to learn a more effective pairwise representation. We validate our model on five large-scale real-world datasets from the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB), and find that it achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three of them. Additionally, TNCN demonstrates excellent scalability on large datasets, outperforming popular GNN baselines by up to 6.4 times in speed. Our code is available at https: //github.com/GraphPKU/TNCN.">

To answer this question, we first present the Temporal Graph Scaling (TGS) dataset, a large collection of temporal graphs consisting of eighty-four ERC20 token transaction networks collected from 2017 to 2023. Next, we evaluate the transferability of Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) for the temporal graph property prediction task by pre-training on a collection of up to sixty-four token transaction networks and then evaluating the downstream performance on twenty unseen token networks. We find that the neural scaling law observed in NLP and Computer Vision also applies in temporal graph learning, where pre-training on greater number of networks leads to improved downstream performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of the transferability of temporal graphs learning. On downstream token networks, the largest pre-trained model outperforms single model TGNNs on thirteen unseen test networks. Therefore, we believe that this is a promising first step towards building foundation models for temporal graphs.">

In this work, we introduce a novel approach by tokenizing time series values to train forecasting models via cross-entropy loss, while considering the continuous nature of time series data. Specifically, we propose Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network, HCAN, a general model-agnostic component that can be integrated with any forecasting model. HCAN is based on a Hierarchy-Aware Attention module that integrates multi-granularity high-entropy features at different hierarchy levels. At each level, we assign a class label for timesteps to train an Uncertainty-Aware Classifier. This classifier mitigates the over-confidence in softmax loss via evidence theory. We also implement a Hierarchical Consistency Loss to maintain prediction consistency across hierarchy levels. Extensive experiments integrating HCAN with state-of-the-art forecasting models demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines on several real-world datasets.

Although autoregressive methods model TDT recursively, they suffer from inefficient inference and error accumulation. We argue that integrating TDT learning into non-autoregressive methods is essential for pursuing effective and efficient time series forecasting. In this study, we introduce the differencing approach to represent TDT and propose a parameter-free and plug-and-play solution through an optimization objective, namely TDT Loss. It leverages the proportion of inconsistent signs between predicted and ground truth TDT as an adaptive weight, dynamically balancing target prediction and fine-grained TDT fitting. Importantly, TDT Loss incurs negligible additional cost, with only $\mathcal{O}(n)$ increased computation and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory requirements, while significantly enhancing the predictive performance of non-autoregressive models. To assess the effectiveness of TDT loss, we conduct extensive experiments on 7 widely used datasets. The experimental results of plugging TDT loss into 6 state-of-the-art methods show that out of the 168 experiments, 75.00\% and 94.05\% exhibit improvements in terms of MSE and MAE with the maximum 24.56\% and 16.31\%, respectively.">

        <tr id="Multivariate time series (MTS) data, when sampled irregularly and asynchronously, often present extensive missing values. Conventional methodologies for MTS analysis tend to rely on temporal embeddings based on timestamps that necessitate subsequent imputations, yet these imputed values frequently deviate substantially from their actual counterparts, thereby compromising prediction accuracy. Furthermore, these methods typically fail to provide robust initial embeddings for values infrequently observed or even absent within the training set, posing significant challenges to model generalizability. In response to these challenges, we propose SCAlable Numerical Embedding (SCANE), a novel framework that treats each feature value as an independent token, effectively bypassing the need for imputation. SCANE regularizes the traits of distinct feature embeddings and enhances representational learning through a scalable embedding mechanism. Coupling SCANE with the Transformer Encoder architecture, we develop the Scalable nUMerical eMbeddIng Transformer (SUMMIT), which is engineered to deliver precise predictive outputs for MTS characterized by prevalent missing entries. Our experimental validation, conducted across three disparate electronic health record (EHR) datasets marked by elevated missing value frequencies, confirms the superior performance of SUMMIT over contemporary state-of-the-art approaches addressing similar challenges. These results substantiate the efficacy of SCANE and SUMMIT, underscoring their potential applicability across a broad spectrum of MTS data analytical tasks.">

        <tr id="Time-series data in real-world settings typically exhibit long-range dependencies and are observed at non-uniform intervals. In these settings, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose \textit{multi-view signature attention}, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has become an increasingly popular research area due to its critical applications in various real-world domains such as traffic management, weather prediction, and financial analysis. Despite significant advancements, existing models face notable challenges, including the necessity of manual hyperparameter tuning for different datasets, and difficulty in effectively distinguishing signal from redundant features in data characterized by strong seasonality. These issues hinder the generalization and practical application of time series forecasting models. To solve this issues, we propose an innovative time series forecasting model TimeSieve designed to address these challenges. Our approach employs wavelet transforms to preprocess time series data, effectively capturing multi-scale features without the need for additional parameters or manual hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we introduce the information bottleneck theory that filters out redundant features from both detail and approximation coefficients, retaining only the most predictive information. This combination reduces significantly improves the model's accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 70\% of the datasets, achieving higher predictive accuracy and better generalization across diverse datasets. Our results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the key challenges in time series forecasting, paving the way for more reliable and efficient predictive models in practical applications.

        <tr id="While most time series are non-stationary, it is inevitable for models to face the distribution shift issue in time series forecasting. Existing solutions manipulate statistical measures (usually mean and std.) to adjust time series distribution. However, these operations can be theoretically seen as the transformation towards zero frequency component of the spectrum which cannot reveal full distribution information and would further lead to information utilization bottleneck in normalization, thus hindering forecasting performance. To address this problem, we propose to utilize the whole frequency spectrum to transform time series to make full use of data distribution from the frequency perspective. We present a deep frequency derivative learning framework, DERITS, for non-stationary time series forecasting. Specifically, DERITS is built upon a novel reversible transformation, namely Frequency Derivative Transformation (FDT) that makes signals derived in the frequency domain to acquire more stationary frequency representations. Then, we propose the Order-adaptive Fourier Convolution Network to conduct adaptive frequency filtering and learning. Furthermore, we organize DERITS as a parallel-stacked architecture for the multi-order derivation and fusion for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several datasets which show the consistent superiority in both time series forecasting and shift alleviation.">

Despite the progress in deep learning for time series analysis, there remains a challenge in addressing the non-stationary nature of time series data. Traditional models, which are built on the assumption of constant statistical properties over time, often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics in realistic time series, resulting in bias and error in time series analysis. This paper introduces the Adaptive Wavelet Network (AdaWaveNet), a novel approach that employs Adaptive Wavelet Transformation for multi-scale analysis of non-stationary time series data. AdaWaveNet designed a lifting scheme-based wavelet decomposition and construction mechanism for adaptive and learnable wavelet transforms, which offers enhanced flexibility and robustness in analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 datasets across 3 different tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and a newly established super-resolution task.

        <tr id="Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due to the dynamic nature of time-series data, it is crucial to equip TSF models with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities, as historical training data and future test data can have different distributions. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the inherent OOD problem in TSF via invariant learning. We identify fundamental challenges of invariant learning for TSF. First, the target variables in TSF may not be sufficiently determined by the input due to unobserved core variables in TSF, breaking the conventional assumption of invariant learning. Second, time-series datasets lack adequate environment labels, while existing environmental inference methods are not suitable for TSF. To address these challenges, we propose FOIL, a model-agnostic framework that enables timeseries Forecasting for Out-of-distribution generalization via Invariant Learning. FOIL employs a novel surrogate loss to mitigate the impact of unobserved variables. Further, FOIL implements a joint optimization by alternately inferring environments effectively with a multi-head network while preserving the temporal adjacency structure, and learning invariant representations across inferred environments for OOD generalized TSF. We demonstrate that the proposed FOIL significantly improves the performance of various TSF models, achieving gains of up to 85%.">

        <tr id="Hierarchical time-series forecasting (HTSF) is an important problem for many real-world business applications where the goal is to simultaneously forecast multiple time-series that are related to each other via a hierarchical relation. Recent works, however, do not address two important challenges that are typically observed in many demand forecasting applications at large companies. First, many time-series at lower levels of the hierarchy have high sparsity i.e., they have a significant number of zeros. Most HTSF methods do not address this varying sparsity across the hierarchy. Further, they do not scale well to the large size of the real-world hierarchy typically unseen in benchmarks used in literature. We resolve both these challenges by proposing HAILS, a novel probabilistic hierarchical model that enables accurate and calibrated probabilistic forecasts across the hierarchy by adaptively modeling sparse and dense time-series with different distributional assumptions and reconciling them to adhere to hierarchical constraints. We show the scalability and effectiveness of our methods by evaluating them against real-world demand forecasting datasets. We deploy HAILS at a large chemical manufacturing company for a product demand forecasting application with over ten thousand products and observe a significant 8.5\% improvement in forecast accuracy and 23% better improvement for sparse time-series. The enhanced accuracy and scalability make HAILS a valuable tool for improved business planning and customer experience.">

This work introduces a \textit{compositional representation learning} approach trained on statistically coherent components extracted from sequential data. Based on a multi-scale change space, an unsupervised approach is proposed to segment the sequential data into chunks with similar statistical properties. A sequence-based encoder model is trained in a multi-task setting to learn compositional representations from these temporal components for time series classification. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on publicly available time series classification benchmarks. Evaluating the coherence of segmented components shows its competitive performance on the unsupervised segmentation task.">

However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile and embedded devices).

We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants.

Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs).

In this paper, we explore the application of KAN to time series forecasting and propose two variants: T-KAN and MT-KAN. T-KAN is designed to detect concept drift within time series and can explain the nonlinear relationships between predictions and previous time steps through symbolic regression, making it highly interpretable in dynamically changing environments. MT-KAN, on the other hand, improves predictive performance by effectively uncovering and leveraging the complex relationships among variables in multivariate time series. Experiments validate the effectiveness of these approaches, demonstrating that T-KAN and MT-KAN significantly outperform traditional methods in time series forecasting tasks, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also improving model interpretability.

However, the limited availability of historical data from these peak periods poses a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages strategically chosen proxy data reflective of potential sales patterns from similar entities during non-peak periods, enriched by features learned from a graph neural networks (GNNs)-based forecasting model, to predict demand during peak events. We formulate the demand prediction as a meta-learning problem and develop the Feature-based First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (F-FOMAML) algorithm that leverages proxy data from non-peak periods and GNN-generated relational metadata to learn feature-specific layer parameters, thereby adapting to demand forecasts for peak events. Theoretically, we show that by considering domain similarities through task-specific metadata, our model achieves improved generalization, where the excess risk decreases as the number of training tasks increases. Empirical evaluations on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Compared to existing state-of-the-art models, our method demonstrates a notable improvement in demand prediction accuracy, reducing the Mean Absolute Error by 26.24% on an internal vending machine dataset and by 1.04% on the publicly accessible JD.com dataset.">

        <tr id="Time series is a typical data type in numerous domains; however, labeling large amounts of time series data can be costly and time-consuming. Learning effective representation from unlabeled time series data is a challenging task. Contrastive learning stands out as a promising method to acquire representations of unlabeled time series data. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised time-series representation learning framework via Time-Frequency Fusion Contrasting (TF-FC) to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. Specifically, TF-FC combines time-domain augmentation with frequency-domain augmentation to generate the diverse samples. For time-domain augmentation, the raw time series data pass through the time-domain augmentation bank (such as jitter, scaling, permutation, and masking) and get time-domain augmentation data. For frequency-domain augmentation, first, the raw time series undergoes conversion into frequency domain data following Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. Then, the frequency data passes through the frequency-domain augmentation bank (such as low pass filter, remove frequency, add frequency, and phase shift) and gets frequency-domain augmentation data. The fusion method of time-domain augmentation data and frequency-domain augmentation data is kernel PCA, which is useful for extracting nonlinear features in high-dimensional spaces. By capturing both the time and frequency domains of the time series, the proposed approach is able to extract more informative features from the data, enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish between different time series. To verify the effectiveness of the TF-FC method, we conducted experiments on four time series domain datasets (i.e., SleepEEG, HAR, Gesture, and Epilepsy). Experimental results show that TF-FC significantly improves in recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces BiLSTM-MLAM, a novel multi-scale time series prediction model. Initially, the approach utilizes bidirectional long short-term memory to capture information from both forward and backward directions in time series data. Subsequently, a multi-scale patch segmentation module generates various long sequences composed of equal-length segments, enabling the model to capture data patterns across multiple time scales by adjusting segment lengths. Finally, the local attention mechanism enhances feature extraction by accurately identifying and weighting important time segments, thereby strengthening the model’s understanding of the local features of the time series, followed by feature fusion. The model demonstrates outstanding performance in time series prediction tasks by effectively capturing sequence information across various time scales. Experimental validation illustrates the superior performance of BiLSTM-MLAM compared to six baseline methods across multiple datasets. When predicting the remaining life of aircraft engines, BiLSTM-MLAM outperforms the best baseline model by 6.66% in RMSE and 11.50% in MAE. In the LTE dataset, it achieves RMSE improvements of 12.77% and MAE enhancements of 3.06%, while in the load dataset, it demonstrates RMSE enhancements of 17.96% and MAE improvements of 30.39%. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the positive impact of each module on prediction accuracy. Through segment length parameter tuning experiments, combining different segment lengths has resulted in lower prediction errors, affirming the effectiveness of the multi-scale fusion strategy in enhancing prediction accuracy by integrating information from multiple time scales.">

Additionally, a filter layer operates in the frequency domain using learnable Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and learnable filters, followed by an inverse FFT to refine item embeddings and reduce noise. We also integrate Gate Linear Units (GLU) to dynamically control information flow, enhancing the model's expressiveness and training stability.

However, in many sequence modeling problems, the underlying process is inherently modular and it is of interest to have inductive biases that mimic this modular structure. In this paper, we introduce SlotSSMs, a novel framework for incorporating independent mechanisms into SSMs to preserve or encourage separation of information. Unlike conventional SSMs that maintain a monolithic state vector, SlotSSMs maintains the state as a collection of multiple vectors called slots. Crucially, the state transitions are performed independently per slot with sparse interactions across slots implemented via the bottleneck of self-attention. In experiments, we evaluate our model in object-centric video understanding, 3D visual reasoning, and video prediction tasks, which involve modeling multiple objects and their long-range temporal dependencies.

        <tr id="The explosion of massive urban data recently has provided us with a valuable opportunity to gain deeper insights into urban regions and the daily lives of residents. Urban region representation learning emerges as a crucial realm for fulfilling this task. Among deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise, given that city elements can be naturally represented as nodes with various connections between them as edges. However, many existing GNN approaches encounter challenges such as over-smoothing and limitations in capturing information from nodes in other regions, resulting in the loss of crucial urban information and a decline in region representation performance. To address these challenges, we leverage urban graph structure information and introduce a hierarchical graph pooling process called Coarsened Graph Attention Pooling (CGAP). CGAP features local attention units to create coarsened intermediate graphs and global features. Additionally, by incorporating urban region graphs and global features into a global attention layer, we harness relational information to enhance representation effectiveness. Furthermore, CGAP integrates region attributes such as Points of Interest (POIs) and inter-regional contexts like human mobility, enabling the exploitation of multi-modal urban data for more comprehensive representation learning. Experiments on three downstream tasks related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals validate the effectiveness of region representations learned by our approach. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that CGAP excels in various socioeconomic prediction tasks compared to competitive baselines.">

        <tr id="Multivariate time series classification (MTSC) has attracted significant research attention due to its diverse real-world applications. Recently, exploiting transformers for MTSC has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, existing methods focus on generic features, providing a comprehensive understanding of data, but they ignore class-specific features crucial for learning the representative characteristics of each class. This leads to poor performance in the case of imbalanced datasets or datasets with similar overall patterns but differing in minor class-specific details. In this paper, we propose a novel Shapelet Transformer (ShapeFormer), which comprises class-specific and generic transformer modules to capture both of these features. In the class-specific module, we introduce the discovery method to extract the discriminative subsequences of each class (i.e. shapelets) from the training set. We then propose a Shapelet Filter to learn the difference features between these shapelets and the input time series. We found that the difference feature for each shapelet contains important class-specific features, as it shows a significant distinction between its class and others. In the generic module, convolution filters are used to extract generic features that contain information to distinguish among all classes. For each module, we employ the transformer encoder to capture the correlation between their features. As a result, the combination of two transformer modules allows our model to exploit the power of both types of features, thereby enhancing the classification performance. Our experiments on 30 UEA MTSC datasets demonstrate that ShapeFormer has achieved the highest accuracy ranking compared to state-of-the-art methods.

        <tr id="Recent studies have attempted to refine the Transformer architecture to demonstrate its effectiveness in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Despite surpassing many linear forecasting models with ever-improving performance, we remain skeptical of Transformers as a solution for LTSF. We attribute the effectiveness of these models largely to the adopted Patch mechanism, which enhances sequence locality to an extent yet fails to fully address the loss of temporal information inherent to the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism. Further investigation suggests that simple linear layers augmented with the Patch mechanism may outperform complex Transformer-based LTSF models. Moreover, diverging from models that use channel independence, our research underscores the importance of cross-variable interactions in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series forecasting. The interaction information between variables is highly valuable but has been misapplied in past studies, leading to suboptimal cross-variable models. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and simple Patch-based Decomposed MLP (PDMLP) for LTSF tasks. Specifically, we employ simple moving averages to extract smooth components and noise-containing residuals from time series data, engaging in semantic information interchange through channel mixing and specializing in random noise with channel independence processing. The PDMLP model consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several real-world datasets. We hope this surprising finding will spur new research directions in the LTSF field and pave the way for more efficient and concise solutions.">

In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

        <tr id="Implicit graph neural networks have gained popularity in recent years as they capture long-range dependencies while improving predictive performance in static graphs. Despite the tussle between performance degradation due to the oversmoothing of learned embeddings and long-range dependency being more pronounced in dynamic graphs, as features are aggregated both across neighborhood and time, no prior work has proposed an implicit graph neural model in a dynamic setting. In this paper, we present Implicit Dynamic Graph Neural Network (IDGNN) a novel implicit neural network for dynamic graphs which is the first of its kind. A key characteristic of IDGNN is that it demonstrably is well-posed, i.e., it is theoretically guaranteed to have a fixed-point representation. We then demonstrate that the standard iterative algorithm often used to train implicit models is computationally expensive in our dynamic setting as it involves computing gradients, which themselves have to be estimated in an iterative manner. To overcome this, we pose an equivalent bilevel optimization problem and propose an efficient single-loop training algorithm that avoids iterative computation by maintaining moving averages of key components of the gradients. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets on both classification and regression tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art baselines. We also demonstrate that our bi-level optimization framework maintains the performance of the expensive iterative algorithm while obtaining up to \textbf{1600x} speed-up.">

This paper presents an approach that utilizes large language models and data source interfaces to explore and collect time series datasets. While obtained from external sources, the collected data share critical statistical properties with primary time series datasets, making it possible to model and adapt to various scenarios. This method enlarges the data quantity when the original data is limited or lacks essential properties.

        <tr id="Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) finds widespread applications across various domains such as financial markets, industrial production, and healthcare. Its primary objective is to learn the normal patterns of time series data, thereby identifying deviations in test samples. Most existing TSAD methods focus on modeling data from the temporal dimension, while ignoring the semantic information in the spatial dimension. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach, called Spatial-Temporal Normality learning (STEN). STEN is composed of a sequence Order prediction-based Temporal Normality learning (OTN) module that captures the temporal correlations within sequences, and a Distance prediction-based Spatial Normality learning (DSN) module that learns the relative spatial relations between sequences in a feature space. By synthesizing these two modules, STEN learns expressive spatial-temporal representations for the normal patterns hidden in the time series data. Extensive experiments on five popular TSAD benchmarks show that STEN substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/STEN.">

Imputation methods including Mean, Mode, Median, Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are compared across different deep learning architectures: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM Networks (Bi-LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Results indicate that the KNN imputation method consistently outperforms other techniques across all models, achieving lower MAPE (0.186) and RMSE (18.495) values. Furthermore, KNN-imputed models exhibit higher R2 values, indicating better model fit than other imputation methods. These findings underscore the importance of preprocessing in time-series forecasting and highlight the potential of KNN imputation to enhance predictive accuracy in real-world applications. Robust imputation strategies like KNN promise to improve forecasting accuracy and reliability, particularly in domains where accurate predictions are crucial for decision-making.

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited prominent performance in learning graph-structured data. Considering node classification task, based on the i.i.d assumption among node labels, the traditional supervised learning simply sums up cross-entropy losses of the independent training nodes and applies the average loss to optimize GNNs' weights. But different from other data formats, the nodes are naturally connected. It is found that the independent distribution modeling of node labels restricts GNNs' capability to generalize over the entire graph and defend adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a new framework, termed joint-cluster supervised learning, to model the joint distribution of each node with its corresponding cluster. We learn the joint distribution of node and cluster labels conditioned on their representations, and train GNNs with the obtained joint loss. In this way, the data-label reference signals extracted from the local cluster explicitly strengthen the discrimination ability on the target node. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our joint-cluster supervised learning can effectively bolster GNNs' node classification accuracy. Furthermore, being benefited from the reference signals which may be free from spiteful interference, our learning paradigm significantly protects the node classification from being affected by the adversarial attack.">

        <tr id="Dynamic graph learning equips the edges with time attributes and allows multiple links between two nodes, which is a crucial technology for understanding evolving data scenarios like traffic prediction and recommendation systems. Existing works obtain the evolving patterns mainly depending on the most recent neighbor sequences. However, we argue that whether two nodes will have interaction with each other in the future is highly correlated with the same interaction that happened in the past. Only considering the recent neighbors overlooks the phenomenon of repeat behavior and fails to accurately capture the temporal evolution of interactions. To fill this gap, this paper presents RepeatMixer, which considers evolving patterns of first and high-order repeat behavior in the neighbor sampling strategy and temporal information learning. Firstly, we define the first-order repeat-aware nodes of the source node as the destination nodes that have interacted historically and extend this concept to high orders as nodes in the destination node's high-order neighbors. Then, we extract neighbors of the source node that interacted before the appearance of repeat-aware nodes with a slide window strategy as its neighbor sequence. Next, we leverage both the first and high-order neighbor sequences of source and destination nodes to learn temporal patterns of interactions via an MLP-based encoder. Furthermore, considering the varying temporal patterns on different orders, we introduce a time-aware aggregation mechanism that adaptively aggregates the temporal representations from different orders based on the significance of their interaction time sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RepeatMixer over state-of-the-art models in link prediction tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed repeat-aware neighbor sampling strategy.">

Selecting an adequate number of lags is important for training accurate forecasting models. Several approaches and heuristics have been devised to solve this task. However, there is no consensus about what the best approach is. Besides, lag selection procedures have been developed based on local models and classical forecasting techniques such as ARIMA. We bridge this gap in the literature by carrying out an extensive empirical analysis of different lag selection methods. We focus on deep learning methods trained in a global approach, i.e., on datasets comprising multiple univariate time series. The experiments were carried out using three benchmark databases that contain a total of 2411 univariate time series. The results indicate that the lag size is a relevant parameter for accurate forecasts. In particular, excessively small or excessively large lag sizes have a considerable negative impact on forecasting performance. Cross-validation approaches show the best performance for lag selection, but this performance is comparable with simple heuristics.">

During inference, these CPTs are utilized to adjust the predicted class probabilities of each window, taking into account the predictions of preceding windows.

Characterizing and modeling contaminant transport processes is crucial to groundwater protection and management. However, challenges still exist in process complexity, data constraint, and computational cost. In the era of big data, the growth of machine learning has led to new opportunities in studying contaminant transport in groundwater systems. In this work, we introduce a new attention‐based graph neural network (aGNN) for modeling contaminant transport with limited monitoring data and quantifying causal connections between contaminant sources (drivers) and their spreading (outcomes). In five synthetic case studies that involve varying monitoring networks in heterogeneous aquifers, aGNN is shown to outperform LSTM‐based (long‐short term memory) and CNN‐ based (convolutional neural network) methods in multistep predictions (i.e., transductive learning). It also demonstrates a high level of applicability in inferring observations for unmonitored sites (i.e., inductive learning). Furthermore, an explanatory analysis based on aGNN quantifies the influence of each contaminant source, which has been validated by a physics‐based model with consistent outcomes with an R2 value exceeding 92%. The major advantage of aGNN is that it not only has a high level of predictive power in multiple scenario evaluations but also substantially reduces computational cost. Overall, this study shows that aGNN is efficient and robust for highly nonlinear spatiotemporal learning in subsurface contaminant transport, and provides a promising tool for groundwater management involving contaminant source attribution.">

        <tr id="Accurate traffic flow forecasting is a crucial research topic in transportation management. However, it is a challenging problem due to rapidly changing traffic conditions, high nonlinearity of traffic flow, and complex spatial and temporal correlations of road networks. Most existing studies either try to capture the spatial dependencies between roads using the same semantic graph over different time steps, or assume all sensors on the roads are equally likely to be connected regardless of the distance between them. However, we observe that the spatial dependencies between roads indeed change over time, and two distant roads are not likely to be helpful to each other when predicting the traffic flow, both of which limit the performance of existing studies. In this paper, we propose Temporal Graph Learning Recurrent Neural Network (TGLRN) to address these problems. More precisely, to effectively model the nature of time series, we leverage Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to dynamically construct a graph at each time step, thereby capturing the time-evolving spatial dependencies between roads (i.e., microscopic view). Simultaneously, we provide the Adaptive Structure Information to the model, ensuring that close and consecutive sensors are considered to be more important for predicting the traffic flow (i.e., macroscopic view). Furthermore, to endow TGLRN with robustness, we introduce an edge sampling strategy when constructing the graph at each time step, which eventually leads to further improvements on the model performance. Experimental results on four commonly used real-world benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of TGLRN.">

        <tr id="In terms of accuracy, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the best architectural choice for the node classification task. Their drawback in real-world deployment is the latency that emerges from the neighbourhood processing operation. One solution to the latency issue is to perform knowledge distillation from a trained GNN to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), where the MLP processes only the features of the node being classified (and possibly some pre-computed structural information). However, the performance of such MLPs in both transductive and inductive settings remains inconsistent for existing knowledge distillation techniques. We propose to address the performance concerns by using a specially-designed student model instead of an MLP. Our model, named Routing-by-Memory (RbM), is a form of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), with a design that enforces expert specialization. By encouraging each expert to specialize on a certain region on the hidden representation space, we demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to derive considerably more consistent performance across multiple datasets.">

        <tr id="In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a potent tool for learning on graph-structured data and won fruitful successes in varied fields. The majority of GNNs follow the message-passing paradigm, where representations of each node are learned by recursively aggregating features of its neighbors. However, this mechanism brings severe over-smoothing and efficiency issues over high-degree graphs (HDGs), wherein most nodes have dozens (or even hundreds) of neighbors, such as social networks, transaction graphs, power grids, etc. Additionally, such graphs usually encompass rich and complex structure semantics, which are hard to capture merely by feature aggregations in GNNs. Motivated by the above limitations, we propose TADA, an efficient and effective front-mounted data augmentation framework for GNNs on HDGs. Under the hood, TADA includes two key modules: (i) feature expansion with structure embeddings, and (ii) topology- and attribute-aware graph sparsification. The former obtains augmented node features and enhanced model capacity by encoding the graph structure into high-quality structure embeddings with our highly-efficient sketching method. Further, by exploiting task-relevant features extracted from graph structures and attributes, the second module enables the accurate identification and reduction of numerous redundant/noisy edges from the input graph, thereby alleviating over-smoothing and facilitating faster feature aggregations over HDGs. Empirically, TADA considerably improves the predictive performance of mainstream GNN models on 8 real homophilic/heterophilic HDGs in terms of node classification, while achieving efficient training and inference processes.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we leverage the power of latent diffusion models to generate synthetic time series tabular data. Along with the temporal and feature correlations, the heterogeneous nature of the feature in the table has been one of the main obstacles in time series tabular data modeling. We tackle this problem by combining the ideas of the variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Our model named as \texttt{TimeAutoDiff} has several key advantages including (1) Generality: the ability to handle the broad spectrum of time series tabular data from single to multi-sequence datasets; (2) Good fidelity and utility guarantees: numerical experiments on six publicly available datasets demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in generating time series tabular data, across four metrics measuring fidelity and utility; (3) Fast sampling speed: entire time series data generation as opposed to the sequential data sampling schemes implemented in the existing diffusion-based models, eventually leading to significant improvements in sampling speed, (4) Entity conditional generation: the first implementation of conditional generation of multi-sequence time series tabular data with heterogenous features in the literature, enabling scenario exploration across multiple scientific and engineering domains.

        <tr id="Objective This study focuses on enhancing the precision of epidemic time series data prediction by integrating Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) into a Graph Neural Network (GNN), forming the GRGNN. The accuracy of the GNN (Graph Neural Network) network with introduced GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) is validated by comparing it with seven commonly used prediction methods. Method The GRGNN methodology involves multivariate time series prediction using a GNN (Graph Neural Network) network improved by the integration of GRU (Gated Recurrent Units). Additionally, Graphical Fourier Transform (GFT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) are introduced. GFT captures inter-sequence correlations in the spectral domain, while DFT transforms data from the time domain to the frequency domain, revealing temporal node correlations. Following GFT and DFT, outbreak data are predicted through one-dimensional convolution and gated linear regression in the frequency domain, graph convolution in the spectral domain, and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) in the time domain. The inverse transformation of GFT and DFT is employed, and final predictions are obtained after passing through a fully connected layer. Evaluation is conducted on three datasets: the COVID-19 datasets of 38 African countries and 42 European countries from worldometers, and the chickenpox dataset of 20 Hungarian regions from Kaggle. Metrics include Average Root Mean Square Error (ARMSE) and Average Mean Absolute Error (AMAE). Result For African COVID-19 dataset and Hungarian Chickenpox dataset, GRGNN consistently outperforms other methods in ARMSE and AMAE across various prediction step lengths. Optimal results are achieved even at extended prediction steps, highlighting the model’s robustness. Conclusion GRGNN proves effective in predicting epidemic time series data with high accuracy, demonstrating its potential in epidemic surveillance and early warning applications. However, further discussions and studies are warranted to refine its application and judgment methods, emphasizing the ongoing need for exploration and research in this domain.">

        <tr id="Dynamic link prediction is an important problem considered by many recent works proposing various approaches for learning temporal edge patterns. To assess their efficacy, models are evaluated on publicly available benchmark datasets involving continuous-time and discrete-time temporal graphs. However, as we show in this work, the suitability of common batch-oriented evaluation depends on the datasets' characteristics, which can cause two issues: First, for continuous-time temporal graphs, fixed-size batches create time windows with different durations, resulting in an inconsistent dynamic link prediction task. Second, for discrete-time temporal graphs, the sequence of batches can additionally introduce temporal dependencies that are not present in the data. In this work, we empirically show that this common evaluation approach leads to skewed model performance and hinders the fair comparison of methods. We mitigate this problem by reformulating dynamic link prediction as a link forecasting task that better accounts for temporal information present in the data. We provide implementations of our new evaluation method for commonly used graph learning frameworks.">

Despite extensive research into self-supervised learning as the cornerstone of FMs, several outstanding issues persist in Graph Foundation Models that rely on graph self-supervised learning, namely: 1) Homogenization. The extent of generalization capability on downstream tasks remains unclear. 2) Scalability. It is unknown how effectively these models can scale to large datasets. 3) Efficiency.

Recently, some studies have exploited Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to impute/fill the missing values in multivariate time-series data. However, when faced with datasets with high missing rates, the imputation error of these methods increases dramatically. To this end, we propose a neural network model based on dynamic contribution and attention, denoted as ContrAttNet. ContrAttNet consists of three novel modules: feature attention module, iLSTM (imputation Long Short-Term Memory) module, and 1D-CNN (1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network) module. ContrAttNet exploits temporal information and spatial feature information to predict missing values, where iLSTM attenuates the memory of LSTM according to the characteristics of the missing values, to learn the contributions of different features. Moreover, the feature attention module introduces an attention mechanism based on contributions, to calculate supervised weights. Furthermore, under the influence of these supervised weights, 1D-CNN processes the time-series data by treating them as spatial features. Experimental results show that ContrAttNet outperforms other state-of-the-art models in the missing value imputation of multivariate time-series data, with average 6% MAPE and 9% MAE on the benchmark datasets.">

Further, unlike typical other many-to-many models, our approach doesn’t require a decoder. Instead, it employs an RNN, generating a label for every input time step.

        <tr id="How to capture dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies remains an open question in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Although recent advanced spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) achieve superior forecasting performance, they either consider pre-defined spatial correlations or simply learn static graphs. Some research has tried to learn many adjacent matrices to reveal time-varying spatial correlations, but they generate discrete graphs which cannot encode evolutionary information and also face computational complexity problem. In this paper, we propose two significant plugins to help automatically learn enhanced dynamic spatial-temporal embedding of MTS data: (1) a novel neural conditional random field (CRF) layer. We find that the implicit time-varying spatial dependencies are reflected by the explicit changeable links between edges, and we propose the neural CRF to encode such pairwise changeable evolutionary inter-dependencies; (2) a structure adaptive graph convolution (SAGC) that does not require pre-defined graphs to capture semantically richer spatial correlations. Then, we integrate the neural CRF, SAGC with recurrent neural network to develop a new STGNN paradigm termed Adaptive Spatial-Temporal graph neural network with Conditional Random Field (ASTCRF), which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. We validate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of ASTCRF on five public benchmark MTS datasets.">

Currently, latent diffusion models are ascending to the forefront of generative modeling for many important data representations. Being the most pivotal in the computer vision domain, latent diffusion models have also recently attracted interest in other communities, including NLP, Speech, and Geometric Space. In this work, we propose TimeLDM, a novel latent diffusion model for high-quality time series generation. TimeLDM is composed of a variational autoencoder that encodes time series into an informative and smoothed latent content and a latent diffusion model operating in the latent space to generate latent information. We evaluate the ability of our method to generate synthetic time series with simulated and realistic datasets, benchmark the performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed TimeLDM persistently delivers high-quality generated time series. Sores from Context-FID and Discriminative indicate that TimeLDM consistently and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art benchmarks with an average improvement of 3.4$\times$ and 3.8$\times$, respectively. Further studies demonstrate that our method presents better performance on different lengths of time series data generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the potential of the latent diffusion model for unconditional time series generation and establish a new baseline for synthetic time series.">

However, when detecting anomalies, the representations of abnormal nodes are prone to be averaged by normal neighbors, making the learned anomaly representations less distinguishable. To tackle this issue, we propose CAGAD -- an unsupervised Counterfactual data Augmentation method for Graph Anomaly Detection -- which introduces a graph pointer neural network as the heterophilic node detector to identify potential anomalies whose neighborhoods are normal-node-dominant. For each identified potential anomaly, we design a graph-specific diffusion model to translate a part of its neighbors, which are probably normal, into anomalous ones. At last, we involve these translated neighbors in GNN neighborhood aggregation to produce counterfactual representations of anomalies. Through aggregating the translated anomalous neighbors, counterfactual representations become more distinguishable and further advocate detection performance. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that CAGAD significantly outperforms strong baselines, with an average improvement of 2.35% on F1, 2.53% on AUC-ROC, and 2.79% on AUC-PR.">

In practice, temporal graphs are formalized as an ordered sequence of static graph snapshots observed at discrete time points. Sequence models such as RNNs or Transformers have long been the predominant backbone networks for modeling such temporal graphs. Yet, despite the promising results, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models (SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying continuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention and achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In this work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to temporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online approximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term. The emergent continuous-time system introduces novel algorithmic challenges, thereby necessitating our development of GraphSSM, a graph state space model for modeling the dynamics of temporal graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphSSM framework across various temporal graph benchmarks.">

The growing interest in precipitation nowcasting offers substantial opportunities for the advancement of current forecasting technologies.

Thus, this paper systemically reviews recent progress in time series precipitation forecasting models. Specifically, we investigate the following key points within background components, covering: i) preprocessing, ii) objective functions, and iii) evaluation metrics. We then categorize forecasting models into \textit{recursive} and \textit{multiple} strategies based on their approaches to predict future frames, investigate the impacts of models using the strategies, and performance assessments. Finally, we evaluate current deep learning-based models for precipitation forecasting on a public benchmark, discuss their limitations and challenges, and present some promising research directions.

In this work, we address the question: can we leverage in-context learning to predict out-of-distribution materials properties? However, this would not be possible for structure property prediction tasks unless an effective method is found to pass atomic-level geometric features to the transformer model. To address this problem, we employ a compound model in which GPT-2 acts on the output of geometry-aware graph neural networks to adapt in-context information. To demonstrate our model's capabilities, we partition the QM9 dataset into sequences of molecules that share a common substructure and use them for in-context learning. This approach significantly improves the performance of the model on out-of-distribution examples, surpassing the one of general graph neural network models.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based methods have recently demonstrated their potential in time series forecasting problems. However, the mainstream approach, primarily utilizing attention to model inter-step correlation in the time domain, is constrained by two significant issues that lead to ineffective and inefficient multivariate forecasting. The first is that key representations in the time domain are scattered and sparse, resulting in parameter bloat and increased difficulty in capturing time dependencies. The second is that treating time step points as uniformly embedded tokens leads to the erasure of inter-variate correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a frequency-wise and variables-oriented transformer-based method. This method leverages the intrinsic conjugate symmetry in the frequency domain, enabling compact frequency domain representations that naturally mix information across time points while reducing spatio-temporal costs. Multivariate inter-correlations can also be captured from similar frequency domain components, which enhances the variables-oriented attention mechanism modeling capability. Further, we employ both polar and complex domain perspectives to enrich the frequency domain representations and decode complicated temporal patterns. We propose frequency-enhanced independent representation multi-head attention (FIR-Attention) to leverage these advantages for improved multivariate interaction. Techniques such as cutting-off frequency and equivalent mapping are used to ensure the model’s lightweight nature. Extensive experiments on eight mainstream datasets show that our approach achieves first-rate satisfactory results and, importantly, requires only one percent of the spatio-temporal cost of mainstream methods.">

        <tr id="Foundation models that can perform inference on any new task without requiring specific training have revolutionized machine learning in vision and language applications. However, applications involving graph-structured data remain a tough nut for foundation models, due to challenges in the unique feature- and label spaces associated with each graph. Traditional graph ML models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on graphs cannot perform inference on a new graph with feature and label spaces different from the training ones. Furthermore, existing models learn functions specific to the training graph and cannot generalize to new graphs. In this work, we tackle these two challenges with a new foundational architecture for inductive node classification named GraphAny. GraphAny models inference on a new graph as an analytical solution to a LinearGNN, thereby solving the first challenge. To solve the second challenge, we learn attention scores for each node to fuse the predictions of multiple LinearGNNs. Specifically, the attention module is carefully parameterized as a function of the entropy-normalized distance-features between multiple LinearGNNs predictions to ensure generalization to new graphs. Empirically, GraphAny trained on the Wisconsin dataset with only 120 labeled nodes can effectively generalize to 30 new graphs with an average accuracy of 67.26\% in an inductive manner, surpassing GCN and GAT trained in the supervised regime, as well as other inductive baselines.">

        <tr id="The modelling of temporal patterns in dynamic graphs is an important current research issue in the development of time-aware GNNs. Whether or not a specific sequence of events in a temporal graph constitutes a temporal pattern not only depends on the frequency of its occurrence. We consider whether it deviates from what is expected in a temporal graph where timestamps are randomly shuffled. While accounting for such a random baseline is important to model temporal patterns, it has mostly been ignored by current temporal graph neural networks. To address this issue we propose HYPA-DBGNN, a novel two-step approach that combines (i) the inference of anomalous sequential patterns in time series data on graphs based on a statistically principled null model, with (ii) a neural message passing approach that utilizes a higher-order De Bruijn graph whose edges capture overrepresented sequential patterns. Our method leverages hypergeometric graph ensembles to identify anomalous edges within both first- and higher-order De Bruijn graphs, which encode the temporal ordering of events. The model introduces an inductive bias that enhances model interpretability. We evaluate our approach for static node classification using benchmark datasets and a synthetic dataset that showcases its ability to incorporate the observed inductive bias regarding over- and under-represented temporal edges. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in detecting similar patterns within empirical datasets, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods in node classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce statistically informed GNNs that leverage temporal and causal sequence anomalies. HYPA-DBGNN represents a path for bridging the gap between statistical graph inference and neural graph representation learning, with potential applications to static GNNs.">

Moreover, these methods often demand substantial domain expertise for parameter tuning and lack theoretical guarantees for augmentation efficacy. To address these issues, we propose Conda, a novel latent diffusion-based GDA method tailored for CTDGs. Conda features a sandwich-like architecture, incorporating a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and a conditional diffusion model, aimed at generating enhanced historical neighbor embeddings for target nodes. Unlike conventional diffusion models trained on entire graphs via pre-training, Conda requires historical neighbor sequence embeddings of target nodes for training, thus facilitating more targeted augmentation. We integrate Conda into the CTDG model and adopt an alternating training strategy to optimize performance. Extensive experimentation across six widely used real-world datasets showcases the consistent performance improvement of our approach, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data.">

To explore the financial asset dependencies dynamics, we propose a novel approach that models the dependencies of assets as an Asset Dependency Matrix (ADM) and treats the ADM sequences as image sequences. This allows us to leverage deep learning-based video prediction methods to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among assets. However, unlike images where neighboring pixels exhibit explicit spatiotemporal dependencies due to the natural continuity of object movements, assets in ADM do not have a natural order. This poses challenges to organizing the relational assets to reveal better the spatiotemporal dependencies among neighboring assets for ADM forecasting. To tackle the challenges, we propose the Asset Dependency Neural Network (ADNN), which employs the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, a highly successful method for video prediction. ADNN can employ static and dynamic transformation functions to optimize the representations of the ADM. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms the baselines in the ADM prediction and downstream application tasks.

        <tr id="Scaling law that rewards large datasets, complex models and enhanced data granularity has been observed in various fields of deep learning. Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future works.\footnote{Codes for our experiments will be made public at: \url{https://github.com/JingzheShi/ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting}.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in graph representation learning. Message passing neural networks, which learn representations through recursively aggregating information from each node and its neighbors, are among the most commonly-used GNNs. However, a wealth of structural information of individual nodes and full graphs is often ignored in such process, which restricts the expressive power of GNNs. Various graph data augmentation methods that enable the message passing with richer structure knowledge have been introduced as one main way to tackle this issue, but they are often focused on individual structure features and difficult to scale up with more structure features. In this work we propose a novel approach, namely collective structure knowledge-augmented graph neural network (CoS-GNN), in which a new message passing method is introduced to allow GNNs to harness a diverse set of node- and graph-level structure features, together with original node features/attributes, in augmented graphs. In doing so, our approach largely improves the structural knowledge modeling of GNNs in both node and graph levels, resulting in substantially improved graph representations. This is justified by extensive empirical results where CoS-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in various graph-level learning tasks, including graph classification, anomaly detection, and out-of-distribution generalization.">

        <tr id="Employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn cohesive and discriminative node representations for clustering has shown promising results in deep graph clustering. However, existing methods disregard the reciprocal relationship between representation learning and structure augmentation. This study suggests that enhancing embedding and structure synergistically becomes imperative for GNNs to unleash their potential in deep graph clustering. A reliable structure promotes obtaining more cohesive node representations, while high-quality node representations can guide the augmentation of the structure, enhancing structural reliability in return. Moreover, the generalization ability of existing GNNs-based models is relatively poor. While they perform well on graphs with high homogeneity, they perform poorly on graphs with low homogeneity. To this end, we propose a graph clustering framework named Synergistic Deep Graph Clustering Network (SynC). In our approach, we design a Transform Input Graph Auto-Encoder (TIGAE) to obtain high-quality embeddings for guiding structure augmentation. Then, we re-capture neighborhood representations on the augmented graph to obtain clustering-friendly embeddings and conduct self-supervised clustering. Notably, representation learning and structure augmentation share weights, significantly reducing the number of model parameters. Additionally, we introduce a structure fine-tuning strategy to improve the model's generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. The code is released on GitHub and Code Ocean.">

        <tr id="The real-world traffic networks undergo expansion through the installation of new sensors, implying that the traffic patterns continually evolve over time. Incrementally training a model on the newly added sensors would make the model forget the past knowledge, i.e., catastrophic forgetting, while retraining the model on the entire network to capture these changes is highly inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Traffic Forecasting Mixture of Experts (TFMoE) for traffic forecasting under evolving networks. The main idea is to segment the traffic flow into multiple homogeneous groups, and assign an expert model responsible for a specific group. This allows each expert model to concentrate on learning and adapting to a specific set of patterns, while minimizing interference between the experts during training, thereby preventing the dilution or replacement of prior knowledge, which is a major cause of catastrophic forgetting. Through extensive experiments on a real-world long-term streaming network dataset, PEMSD3-Stream, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TFMoE. Our results showcase superior performance and resilience in the face of catastrophic forgetting, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in dealing with continual learning for traffic flow forecasting in long-term streaming networks.">

These models typically involve a decoder trained using either its previous forecasts or the actual observed values as the decoder inputs. However, relying on self-generated predictions can lead to the rapid accumulation of errors over multiple steps, while using the actual observations introduces exposure bias as these values are unavailable during the extrapolation stage. In this regard, this study proposes a novel training approach called reinforced decoder, which introduces auxiliary models to generate alternative decoder inputs that remain accessible when extrapolating. Additionally, a reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to dynamically select the optimal inputs to improve accuracy.

Most link prediction algorithms are designed for networks with only one type of relation between nodes but neglect the fact that many complex systems, including transportation and social networks, consisting of multi-modalities of interactions that correspond to different nature of interactions and dynamics that can be modeled as multiplex network, where different types of relation are represented in different layers. This paper proposes a Multi-Relations-aware Graph Neural Network (MRGNN) framework to learn effective node representations for multiplex networks and make more accurate link predictions, especially for weak ties. Specifically, our model utilizes an intra-layer node-level feature propagation process and an inter-layer representation merge process, which applies a simple yet effective logistic or semantic attention voting mechanism to adaptively aggregate information from different layers. Extensive experiments on four diversified multiplex networks show that MRGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art multiplex link prediction algorithms on overall prediction accuracy, and works pretty well on forecasting weak ties">

        <tr id="Deep graph clustering (DGC) has been a promising method for clustering graph data in recent years. However, existing research primarily focuses on optimizing clustering outcomes by improving the quality of embedded representations, resulting in slow-speed complex models. Additionally, these methods do not consider changes in node similarity and corresponding adjustments in the original structure during the iterative optimization process after updating node embeddings, which easily falls into the representation collapse issue. We introduce an Efficient Graph Auto-Encoder and a dynamic graph weight updating strategy to address these issues, forming the basis for our proposed Fast Deep Graph Clustering (FastDGC) network. Specifically, we significantly reduce feature dimensions using a linear transformation that preserves the original node similarity. We then employ a single-layer graph convolutional filtering approximation to replace multiple layers of graph convolutional neural network, reducing computational complexity and parameter count. During iteration, we calculate the similarity between nodes using the linearly transformed features and periodically update the original graph structure to reduce edges with low similarity, thereby enhancing the learning of discriminative and cohesive representations. Theoretical analysis confirms that EGAE has lower computational complexity. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves clustering performance and achieves a speedup of 2~3 orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing outstanding performance. The code for our model is available at https://github.com/Marigoldwu/FastDGC.

Traffic flow parameters are volatile and uncertain, making traffic flow forecasting a difficult task if the appropriate forecasting model is not used. Additionally, the non-Euclidean data structure of traffic flow parameters is challenging to analyze from both spatial and temporal perspectives. State-of-the-art deep learning approaches use pure convolution, recurrent neural networks, and hybrid methods to achieve this objective efficiently. However, many of the approaches in the literature rely on complex architectures that can be difficult to train. This complexity also adds to the black-box nature of deep learning. This study introduces a novel deep learning architecture, referred to as the multigraph convolution neural network (MGCNN), for turning movement prediction at intersections. The proposed architecture combines a multigraph structure, built to model temporal variations in traffic data, with a spectral convolution operation to support modeling the spatial variations in traffic data over the graphs. The proposed model was tested using twenty days of flow and traffic control data collected from an arterial in downtown Chattanooga, TN, with ten signalized intersections. The model's ability to perform short-term predictions over 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes into the future was evaluated against four baseline state-of-the-art models.

While SFDA is prevalent in computer vision, it remains largely unexplored in time series analysis. Existing SFDA methods, designed for visual data, struggle to capture the inherent temporal dynamics of time series, hindering adaptation performance. This paper proposes MAsk And imPUte (MAPU), a novel and effective approach for time series SFDA. MAPU addresses the critical challenge of temporal consistency by introducing a novel temporal imputation task. This task involves randomly masking time series signals and leveraging a dedicated temporal imputer to recover the original signal within the learned embedding space, bypassing the complexities of noisy raw data. Notably, MAPU is the first method to explicitly address temporal consistency in the context of time series SFDA. Additionally, it offers seamless integration with existing SFDA methods, providing greater flexibility. We further introduce E-MAPU, which incorporates evidential uncertainty estimation to address the overconfidence issue inherent in softmax predictions. To achieve that, we leverage evidential deep learning to obtain a better-calibrated pre-trained model and adapt the target encoder to map out-of-support target samples to a new feature representation closer to the source domain's support. This fosters better alignment, ultimately enhancing adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world time series datasets demonstrate that both MAPU and E-MAPU achieve significant performance gains compared to existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approaches for tackling various time series domain adaptation problems.">

Generative time-series models have the potential to overcome these problems, allowing representative synthetic data, such as people's movement in cities, to be shared openly and be used to the benefit of society at large. However, contemporary approaches are limited to prohibitively short sequences and small scales. Aside from major memory limitations, the models generate less accurate and less representative samples the longer the sequences are. This issue is further exacerbated by the lack of a comprehensive and accessible benchmark. Furthermore, a common need in practical applications is what-if analysis and dynamic adaptation to data distribution changes, for usage in decision making and to manage a changing world: What if this road is temporarily blocked or another road is added? The focus of this paper is on mobility data, such as people's movement in cities, requiring all these issues to be addressed. To this end, we propose a transformer-based diffusion model, TDDPM, for time-series which outperforms and scales substantially better than state-of-the-art. This is evaluated in a new comprehensive benchmark across several sequence lengths, standard datasets, and evaluation measures. We also demonstrate how the model can be conditioned on a prior over spatial occupancy frequency information, allowing the model to generate mobility data for previously unseen environments and for hypothetical scenarios where the underlying road network and its usage changes. This is evaluated by training on mobility data from part of a city. Then, using only aggregate spatial information as prior, we demonstrate out-of-distribution generalization to the unobserved remainder of the city.">

        <tr id="Transformers have revolutionized various domains of artificial intelligence due to their unique ability to model long-range dependencies in data. However, they lack in nuanced, context-dependent modulation of features and information flow. This paper introduces two significant enhancements to the transformer architecture - the Evaluator Adjuster Unit (EAU) and Gated Residual Connections (GRC) - designed to address these limitations. The EAU dynamically modulates attention outputs based on the relevance of the input context, allowing for more adaptive response patterns. Concurrently, the GRC modifies the transformer's residual connections through a gating mechanism that selectively controls the information flow, thereby enhancing the network's ability to focus on contextually important features. We evaluate the performance of these enhancements across several benchmarks in natural language processing. Our results demonstrate improved adaptability and efficiency, suggesting that these modifications could set new standards for designing flexible and context-aware transformer models.">

The evolution of deep learning methods for time series prediction has progressed from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to the recently popularized Transformer network. However, each of these methods has encountered specific issues. Recent studies have questioned the effectiveness of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers for time series prediction, prompting a reevaluation of approaches to LTSF (Long Time Series Forecasting) problems. To circumvent the limitations present in current models, this paper introduces a novel hybrid network, Temporal Convolutional Network-Linear (TCN-Linear), which leverages the temporal prediction capabilities of the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to enhance the capacity of LSTF-Linear. Time series from three classical chaotic systems (Lorenz, Mackey–Glass, and Rossler) and real-world stock data serve as experimental datasets. Numerical simulation results indicate that, compared to classical networks and novel hybrid models, our model achieves the lowest RMSE, MAE, and MSE with the fewest training parameters, and its R2 value is the closest to 1.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent framework for graph mining, leading to significant advances across various domains. Stemmed from the node-wise representations of GNNs, existing explanation studies have embraced the subgraph-specific viewpoint that attributes the decision results to the salient features and local structures of nodes. However, graph-level tasks necessitate long-range dependencies and global interactions for advanced GNNs, deviating significantly from subgraph-specific explanations. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel intrinsically interpretable scheme for graph classification, termed as Global Interactive Pattern (GIP) learning, which introduces learnable global interactive patterns to explicitly interpret decisions. GIP first tackles the complexity of interpretation by clustering numerous nodes using a constrained graph clustering module. Then, it matches the coarsened global interactive instance with a batch of self-interpretable graph prototypes, thereby facilitating a transparent graph-level reasoning process. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GIP yields significantly superior interpretability and competitive performance to~the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.">

Diffusion generative models, as an emerging research focus, have been applied to graph generation tasks. Overall, according to the space of states and time steps, diffusion generative models can be categorized into discrete-/continuous-state discrete-/continuous-time fashions. In this paper, we formulate the graph diffusion generation in a discrete-state continuous-time setting, which has never been studied in previous graph diffusion models. The rationale of such a formulation is to preserve the discrete nature of graph-structured data and meanwhile provide flexible sampling trade-offs between sample quality and efficiency. Analysis shows that our training objective is closely related to generation quality, and our proposed generation framework enjoys ideal invariant/equivariant properties concerning the permutation of node ordering. Our proposed model shows competitive empirical performance against state-of-the-art graph generation solutions on various benchmarks and, at the same time, can flexibly trade off the generation quality and efficiency in the sampling phase.">

This paper proposes adapting an established model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm for short-term load forecasting in the context of few-shot learning. Specifically, the proposed method can rapidly adapt and generalize within any unknown load time series of arbitrary length using only minimal training samples. In this context, the meta-learning model learns an optimal set of initial parameters for a base-level learner recurrent neural network. The proposed model is evaluated using a dataset of historical load consumption data from real-world consumers. Despite the examined load series' short length, it produces accurate forecasts outperforming transfer learning and task-specific machine learning methods by $12.5\%$. To enhance robustness and fairness during model evaluation, a novel metric, mean average log percentage error, is proposed that alleviates the bias introduced by the commonly used MAPE metric. Finally, a series of studies to evaluate the model's robustness under different hyperparameters and time series lengths is also conducted, demonstrating that the proposed approach consistently outperforms all other models.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as potent tools for predicting outcomes in graph-structured data. Despite their efficacy, a significant drawback of GNNs lies in their limited ability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, posing challenges to their reliability in contexts where errors carry significant consequences. Moreover, GNNs typically excel in in-distribution settings, assuming that training and test data follow identical distributions a condition often unmet in real world graph data scenarios. In this article, we leverage conformal prediction, a widely recognized statistical technique for quantifying uncertainty by transforming predictive model outputs into prediction sets, to address uncertainty quantification in GNN predictions amidst conditional shift\footnote{Representing the change in conditional probability distribution \(P(label|input)\) from source domain to target domain.} in graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Additionally, we propose a novel loss function aimed at refining model predictions by minimizing conditional shift in latent stages. Termed Conditional Shift Robust (CondSR) conformal prediction for GNNs, our approach CondSR is model-agnostic and adaptable to various classification models. We validate the effectiveness of our method on standard graph benchmark datasets, integrating it with state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves any predefined target marginal coverage, enhances the accuracy of state of the art GNN models by up to 12\% under conditional shift, and reduces the prediction set size by up to 48\%.

While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach.

Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively.

We generalize the diffusion equation with stochastic diffusivity at each time step, which aims to capture the multi-faceted information flows among interdependent data. Furthermore, we derive a new learning objective through causal inference, which can guide the model to learn generalizable patterns of interdependence that are insensitive across domains. Regarding practical implementation, we introduce three model instantiations that can be considered as the generalized versions of GCN, GAT, and Transformers, respectively, which possess advanced robustness against distribution shifts. We demonstrate their promising efficacy for out-of-distribution generalization on diverse real-world datasets.">

        <tr id="Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing supply chain management. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our rigorous benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738%), RMSE (4.8553%), MAE (3.9991%), and MAPE (20.1575%). Additionally, MCDFN's predictions were statistically indistinguishable from actual values, confirmed by a paired t-test with a 5% p-value and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.">

Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have suggested frequency-domain Data augmentation (DA) is effec tive for time series prediction. Existing frequency-domain augmentations disturb the original data with various full-spectrum noises, leading to excess domain gap between augmented and original data. Although impressive performance has been achieved in certain cases, frequency-domain DA has yet to be generalized to time series prediction datasets. In this paper, we found that frequency-domain augmentations can be significantly improved by two modifications that limit the perturbations. First, we found that limiting the perturbation to only dominant frequencies significantly outperforms full-spectrum perturbations. Dominant fre quencies represent the main periodicity and trends of the signal and are more important than other frequencies. Second, we found that simply shuffling the dominant frequency components is superior over sophisticated designed random perturbations. Shuffle rearranges the original components (magnitudes and phases) and limits the external noise. With these two modifications, we proposed dominant shuffle, a simple yet effective data augmentation for time series prediction. Our method is very simple yet powerful and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. Extensive experiments with eight datasets and six popular time series models demonstrate that our method consistently improves the baseline performance under various settings and significantly outperforms other DA methods.

        <tr id="Graph unlearning has emerged as an essential tool for safeguarding user privacy and mitigating the negative impacts of undesirable data. Meanwhile, the advent of dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) marks a significant advancement due to their superior capability in learning from dynamic graphs, which encapsulate spatial-temporal variations in diverse real-world applications (e.g., traffic forecasting). With the increasing prevalence of DGNNs, it becomes imperative to investigate the implementation of dynamic graph unlearning. However, current graph unlearning methodologies are designed for GNNs operating on static graphs and exhibit limitations including their serving in a pre-processing manner and impractical resource demands. Furthermore, the adaptation of these methods to DGNNs presents non-trivial challenges, owing to the distinctive nature of dynamic graphs. To this end, we propose an effective, efficient, model-agnostic, and post-processing method to implement DGNN unlearning. Specifically, we first define the unlearning requests and formulate dynamic graph unlearning in the context of continuous-time dynamic graphs. After conducting a role analysis on the unlearning data, the remaining data, and the target DGNN model, we propose a method called Gradient Transformation and a loss function to map the unlearning request to the desired parameter update. Evaluations on six real-world datasets and state-of-the-art DGNN backbones demonstrate its effectiveness (e.g., limited performance drop even obvious improvement) and efficiency (e.g., at most 7.23$\times$ speed-up) outperformance, and potential advantages in handling future unlearning requests (e.g., at most 32.59$\times$ speed-up).">

        <tr id="Transformer-based and MLP-based methods have emerged as leading approaches in time series forecasting (TSF). While Transformer-based methods excel in capturing long-range dependencies, they suffer from high computational complexities and tend to overfit. Conversely, MLP-based methods offer computational efficiency and adeptness in modeling temporal dynamics, but they struggle with capturing complex temporal patterns effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MLP-based Adaptive Multi-Scale Decomposition (AMD) framework for TSF. Our framework decomposes time series into distinct temporal patterns at multiple scales, leveraging the Multi-Scale Decomposable Mixing (MDM) block to dissect and aggregate these patterns in a residual manner. Complemented by the Dual Dependency Interaction (DDI) block and the Adaptive Multi-predictor Synthesis (AMS) block, our approach effectively models both temporal and channel dependencies and utilizes autocorrelation to refine multi-scale data integration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our AMD framework not only overcomes the limitations of existing methods but also consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks across various datasets, showcasing superior efficiency.

        <tr id="Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are Graph Neural Networks where the convolutions are applied over a graph. In contrast to Convolutional Neural Networks, GCN's are designed to perform inference on graphs, where the number of nodes can vary, and the nodes are unordered. In this study, we address two important challenges related to GCNs: i) oversmoothing; and ii) the utilization of node relational properties (i.e., heterophily and homophily). Oversmoothing is the degradation of the discriminative capacity of nodes as a result of repeated aggregations. Heterophily is the tendency for nodes of different classes to connect, whereas homophily is the tendency of similar nodes to connect. We propose a new strategy for addressing these challenges in GCNs based on Transfer Entropy (TE), which measures of the amount of directed transfer of information between two time varying nodes. Our findings indicate that using node heterophily and degree information as a node selection mechanism, along with feature-based TE calculations, enhances accuracy across various GCN models. Our model can be easily modified to improve classification accuracy of a GCN model. As a trade off, this performance boost comes with a significant computational overhead when the TE is computed for many graph nodes.">

        <tr id="The dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data is message passing. Despite being a strong inductive bias, the local message passing mechanism suffers from pathological issues such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited node-level expressivity. To address these limitations we propose Bundle Neural Networks (BuNN), a new type of GNN that operates via message diffusion over flat vector bundles - structures analogous to connections on Riemannian manifolds that augment the graph by assigning to each node a vector space and an orthogonal map. A BuNN layer evolves the features according to a diffusion-type partial differential equation. When discretized, BuNNs are a special case of Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs), a recently proposed MPNN capable of mitigating over-smoothing. The continuous nature of message diffusion enables BuNNs to operate on larger scales of the graph and, therefore, to mitigate over-squashing. Finally, we prove that BuNN can approximate any feature transformation over nodes on any (potentially infinite) family of graphs given injective positional encodings, resulting in universal node-level expressivity. We support our theory via synthetic experiments and showcase the strong empirical performance of BuNNs over a range of real-world tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmarks in transductive and inductive settings.">

In this paper, we pioneer structured analyses of link-level anomalies and graph representation learning for identifying anomalous links in these graphs.

We present a method for generating and injecting such typed anomalies into graphs. Next, we introduce a novel method to generate continuous-time dynamic graphs with consistent patterns across time, structure, and context. To allow temporal graph methods to learn the link anomaly detection task, we extend the generic link prediction setting by: (1) conditioning link existence on contextual edge attributes; and (2) refining the training regime to accommodate diverse perturbations in the negative edge sampler. Building on this, we benchmark methods for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets -- featuring synthetic and labeled organic anomalies and employing six state-of-the-art learning methods -- validate our taxonomy and generation processes for anomalies and benign graphs, as well as our approach to adapting link prediction methods for anomaly detection. Our results further reveal that different learning methods excel in capturing different aspects of graph normality and detecting different types of anomalies.

The accurate prediction of future values in a time series is vital for informed planning and resource allocation. The aim of this study is to explore whether the utilization of seasonal decomposition techniques, such as classical decomposition, X-12-ARIMA, and seasonal decomposition of time series (STL), can improve the effectiveness of time series forecasting models by separating the data into its distinct components, including trend and seasonality. We conduct a comprehensive analysis using real-world time series data, employing popular forecasting models like ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and machine learning-based approaches. By comparing the forecasting accuracy of these models with and without the application of seasonal decomposition techniques, we provide empirical evidence to support the hypothesis. Our research results provide valuable insights into the tangible ad- vantages of integrating seasonal decomposition techniques in time series forecasting, potentially contributing to enhanced decision support systems across diverse application domains.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has been an essential field in many different application areas, including economic analysis, meteorology, and so forth. The majority of time series forecasting models are trained using the mean squared error (MSE). However, this training based on MSE causes a limitation known as prediction delay. The prediction delay, which implies the ground-truth precedes the prediction, can cause serious problems in a variety of fields, e.g., finance and weather forecasting -- as a matter of fact, predictions succeeding ground-truth observations are not practically meaningful although their MSEs can be low. This paper proposes a new perspective on traditional time series forecasting tasks and introduces a new solution to mitigate the prediction delay. We introduce a continuous-time gated recurrent unit (GRU) based on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) which can supervise explicit time-derivatives. We generalize the GRU architecture in a continuous-time manner and minimize the prediction delay through our time-derivative regularization. Our method outperforms in metrics such as MSE, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Time Distortion Index (TDI). In addition, we demonstrate the low prediction delay of our method in a variety of datasets.">

While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is the more expressive model with better predictive performance, we will show that it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: it does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. Also, TACTiS does not provide any guarantees for marginalization consistency. We develop a novel probabilistic irregular time series forecasting model, Marginalization Consistent Mixtures of Separable Flows (moses), that mixes several normalizing flows with (i) Gaussian Processes with full covariance matrix as source distributions and (ii) a separable invertible transformation, aiming to combine the expressivity of normalizing flows with the marginalization consistency of Gaussians.

Advanced SSMs like S5 and S6 (Mamba) in addressing non-uniform sampling, their recursive structures impede efficient SSM computation via convolution. To overcome compatibility limitations in parallel convolutional computation, this paper proposes a novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy. Theoretical analysis of SSMs through the lens of Event-Triggered Control (ETC) theory reveals the Non-Stable State (NSS) problem, where deviations from sampling point requirements lead to error transmission and accumulation, causing the divergence of the SSM's hidden state. Our analysis further reveals that adjustments of input sequences with early memories can mitigate the NSS problem, achieving Sampling Step Adaptation (SSA). Building on this insight, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play mechanism, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data. This enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points. Experiments on long-range modeling tasks in autoregressive language modeling and Long Range Arena demonstrate the general effectiveness of the SMR mechanism for a series of SSM models.">

RSRN has demonstrated energy-efficient and effective forecasting capabilities in offline mode, making it suitable for various applications. However, offline training faces challenges, such as limited storage capacity, computational power, and evolving datasets. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an online learning approach to the RSRN model. We present adaptations of two online learning algorithms, Projected Online Gradient Descent (POGD) and Follow-The-Proximally-Regularized-Leader (FTRL-Proximal), for training RSRN in real-time. POGD leverages Back Propagation Through Time (BPTT) for handling dependencies with a sliding window, while FTRL-Proximal offers a balance between adaptability and stability, especially for sparse data. Our approach is the first to introduce RSRN’s forecasting capabilities in a dynamic environment, demonstrating its potential in real-world applications where data availability is not guaranteed. The effectiveness of the online RSRN with both approaches is demonstrated through experimental results on benchmark datasets, showcasing competitive performance that surpasses offline mode computation and result.">

Deep neural networks, however, have often struggled with these for a variety of reasons. Recent advances, both in system engineering as well as model design, have enabled the scaling up of model that are purported to support extended context length. In particular, the state-space and linear recurrent neural network families of models hypothetically can entend to infinite sequence lenth. However, is this too good to be true? We conduct an evaluation to show that while such claims may be sound theoretically, there remain large practical gaps that are empirically observed.

Recent advancements in the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and attention mechanisms have markedly enhanced the accuracy of runoff forecasting models. This article introduces an innovative hybrid model, ResTCN-DAM, which synergizes the strengths of deep residual network (ResNet), temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), and dual attention mechanisms (DAMs). The proposed ResTCN-DAM is designed to leverage the unique attributes of these three modules: TCN has outstanding capability to process time series data in parallel. By combining with modified ResNet, multiple TCN layers can be densely stacked to capture more hidden information in the temporal dimension. DAM module adeptly captures the interdependencies within both temporal and feature dimensions, adeptly accentuating relevant time steps/features while diminishing less significant ones with minimal computational cost. Furthermore, the snapshot ensemble method is able to obtain the effect of training multiple models through one single training process, which ensures the accuracy and robustness of the forecasts. The deep integration and collaborative cooperation of these modules comprehensively enhance the model's forecasting capability from various perspectives. Ablation studies conducted validate the efficacy of each module, and through multiple sets of comparative experiments, it is shown that the proposed ResTCN-DAM has exceptional and consistent performance across varying lead times. We also employ visualization techniques to display heatmaps of the model's weights, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. When compared with the prevailing neural network-based runoff forecasting models, ResTCN-DAM exhibits state-of-the-art accuracy, temporal robustness, and interpretability, positioning it at the forefront of contemporary research.">

        <tr id="Accurate Short-Term Load Forecasting is very important for power system operation. However, the existing methods for regional load forecasting often lack consideration of the differentiated load characteristics and the interrelationships between various types of loads. Particularly during extreme weather events, demand responses, and other special occurrences, focusing only on the overall trend of regional load changes can lead to significant forecasting errors. Additionally, under extreme weather conditions, various loads within a region exhibit different response patterns. This paper proposes a multivariate time series forecasting model based on an Adaptive Graph Neural Network (ADAGNN) to treat various load types as nodes in a graph network, adaptively constructing adjacency matrices through a graph construction layer to extract inter-load relational information; it also uses graph convolution and temporal convolution to capture different load change patterns in regional loads. Considering the existence of different scales of cyclical changes in time series, an initial dilated convolution method is proposed, endowing the ADAGNN model with the ability to adaptively select the size of convolution kernels to extract multi-scale features of the original series. Ultimately, the model outputs the forecast data for all categorized loads, and the regional load forecast is obtained by summation. A case study is conducted using regional load data from a province in China. Relative to the optimal model in the control group, the proposed ADAGNN model improved by 1.06%, 43.32%, and 42.24% in the MAPE, MAE, and RMSE metrics, respectively, thus validating its high predictive accuracy and scalability.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification tasks but often fail to generalize when training and test nodes come from different distributions, limiting their practicality. To overcome this, recent approaches adopt invariant learning techniques from the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization field, which seek to establish stable prediction methods across environments. However, the applicability of these invariant assumptions to graph data remains unverified, and such methods often lack solid theoretical support. In this work, we introduce the Topology-Aware Dynamic Reweighting (TAR) framework, which dynamically adjusts sample weights through gradient flow in the geometric Wasserstein space during training. Instead of relying on strict invariance assumptions, we prove that our method is able to provide distributional robustness, thereby enhancing the out-of-distribution generalization performance on graph data. By leveraging the inherent graph structure, TAR effectively addresses distribution shifts. Our framework's superiority is demonstrated through standard testing on four graph OOD datasets and three class-imbalanced node classification datasets, exhibiting marked improvements over existing methods.">

Unlike traditional imputation methods, which predominantly rely on numerical estimations, CLAIM utilizes contextually relevant natural language descriptors to fill missing values. This approach transforms datasets into natural language contextualized formats that are inherently more aligned with LLMs' capabilities, thereby facilitating the dual use of LLMs: first, to generate missing value descriptors, and then, to fine-tune the LLM on the enriched dataset for improved performance in downstream tasks. Our evaluations across diverse datasets and missingness patterns reveal CLAIM's superior performance over existing imputation techniques. Furthermore, our investigation into the effectiveness of context-specific versus generic descriptors for missing data highlights the importance of contextual accuracy in enhancing LLM performance for data imputation. The results underscore CLAIM's potential to markedly improve the reliability and quality of data analysis and machine learning models, offering a more nuanced and effective solution for handling missing data.">

        <tr id="Graph clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning. Deep learning methods achieve the state-of-the-art results in recent years, but they still cannot work without predefined cluster numbers. Such limitation motivates us to pose a more challenging problem of graph clustering with unknown cluster number. We propose to address this problem from a fresh perspective of graph information theory (i.e., structural information). In the literature, structural information has not yet been introduced to deep clustering, and its classic definition falls short of discrete formulation and modeling node features. In this work, we first formulate a differentiable structural information (DSI) in the continuous realm, accompanied by several theoretical results. By minimizing DSI, we construct the optimal partitioning tree where densely connected nodes in the graph tend to have the same assignment, revealing the cluster structure. DSI is also theoretically presented as a new graph clustering objective, not requiring the predefined cluster number. Furthermore, we design a neural LSEnet in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space, where we integrate node features to structural information via manifold-valued graph convolution. Extensive empirical results on real graphs show the superiority of our approach.">

Traditionally, this has been addressed through autoregressive generation using next-event prediction models, such as Marked Temporal Point Processes. However, autoregressive methods use their own output for future predictions, potentially reducing quality as the prediction horizon extends. In this paper, we challenge traditional approaches by introducing a novel benchmark, HoTPP, specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to predict event sequences over a horizon. This benchmark features a new metric inspired by object detection in computer vision, addressing the limitations of existing metrics in assessing models with imprecise time-step predictions. Our evaluations on established datasets employing various models demonstrate that high accuracy in next-event prediction does not necessarily translate to superior horizon prediction, and vice versa. HoTPP aims to serve as a valuable tool for developing more robust event sequence prediction methods, ultimately paving the way for further advancements in the field.">

        <tr id="Recently, multiple models proposed for link prediction (LP) demonstrate impressive results on benchmark datasets. However, many popular benchmark datasets often assume that dataset samples are drawn from the same distribution (i.e., IID samples). In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; since uncontrolled factors may lead train and test samples to come from separate distributions. To tackle the distribution shift problem, recent work focuses on creating datasets that feature distribution shifts and designing generalization methods that perform well on the new data. However, those studies only consider distribution shifts that affect {\it node-} and {\it graph-level} tasks, thus ignoring link-level tasks. Furthermore, relatively few LP generalization methods exist. To bridge this gap, we introduce a set of LP-specific data splits which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift. We verify the shift's effect empirically through evaluation of different SOTA LP methods and subsequently couple these methods with generalization techniques. Interestingly, LP-specific methods frequently generalize poorly relative to heuristics or basic GNN methods. Finally, this work provides analysis to uncover insights for enhancing LP generalization.

We thus propose Neural Bond Graph Encoder (NBgE), a model agnostic physical-informed encoder tailored for multi-physics systems. It provides an unified framework for any multi-physics informed AI with a graph encoder readable for any deep learning model. Our experiments on two challenging multi-domain physical systems - a Direct Current Motor and the Respiratory system - demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a multi-variate time series forecasting task.">

        <tr id="Recent works show great interest in designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that scale to large graphs. While previous work focuses on designing advanced sampling techniques for existing GNNs, the design of non-parametric GNNs, an orthogonal direction for scalable performance, has aroused lots of concerns recently. For example, nearly all top solutions in the Open Graph Benchmark leaderboard are non-parametric GNNs. Despite their high predictive performance and scalability, non-parametric GNNs still face two limitations. First, due to the propagation of over-smoothed features, they suffer from severe performance degradation along with the propagation depth. More importantly, they only consider the graph structure and ignore the feature influence during the non-parametric propagation, leading to sub-optimal propagated features. To address these limitations, we present non-parametric attention (NPA), a plug-and-play module that is compatible with non-parametric GNNs, to get scalable and deep GNNs simultaneously. We have deployed NPA in Tencent with the Angel platform, and we further evaluate NPA on both real-world datasets and large-scale industrial datasets. Experimental results on seven homophilic graphs (including the industrial Tencent Video graph) and five heterophilic graphs demonstrate NPA enjoys high performance -- achieves large performance gain over existing non-parametric GNNs, deeper architecture -- improves non-parametric GNNs with large model depth, and high scalability -- can support large-scale graphs with low time costs. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large ogbn-papers100M dataset.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective in various machine learning (ML) tasks involving graphs, such as node/graph classification and link prediction. However, explaining the decisions made by GNNs poses challenges because of the aggregated relational information based on graph structure, leading to complex data transformations. Existing methods for explaining GNNs often face limitations in systematically exploring diverse substructures and evaluating results in the absence of ground truths. To address this gap, we introduce GNNAnatomy, a model- and dataset-agnostic visual analytics system designed to facilitate the generation and evaluation of multi-level explanations for GNNs. In GNNAnatomy, we employ graphlets to elucidate GNN behavior in graph-level classification tasks. By analyzing the associations between GNN classifications and graphlet frequencies, we formulate hypothesized factual and counterfactual explanations. To validate a hypothesized graphlet explanation, we introduce two metrics: (1) the correlation between its frequency and the classification confidence, and (2) the change in classification confidence after removing this substructure from the original graph. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNAnatomy, we conduct case studies on both real-world and synthetic graph datasets from various domains. Additionally, we qualitatively compare GNNAnatomy with a state-of-the-art GNN explainer, demonstrating the utility and versatility of our design.">

Synthetic data has recently emerged as a viable alternative to prevent the disclosure of user-protected information that complies with data sharing regulations. Both public and private sectors commonly use a combination of tabular and time-series tables that often contains user-related sensitive information. They are usually intrinsically interlinked as they describe the users and their behaviors over different perimeters. Moreover, it contains both numerical and categorical features, adding complexity to the anonymization task. State of the art generative methods, specialized either in tabular or time-series data, are able to generate high quality synthetic data. However, if each table is generated independently, it becomes impossible to link them. As a result, the usability of such synthetic data is impacted. To address this issue, we not only propose a coherent multi-table generative model that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to sample both tabular and time-series tables , but also a conditional time-series generative model that handles both numerical and categorical features. Additionally, many experiments are conducted to analyse the inner modules of our model and evaluate it on an in-house private dataset in order to prove the viability of the synthetic data generated for machine learning tasks.">

While commonly used attribution methods in explainable AI attempt to address this issue, they typically rely on associational rather than causal relationships. In this study, within the context of time series classification, we introduce a novel framework to assess the causal effect of concepts, i.e., predefined segments within a time series, on specific classification outcomes. To achieve this, we leverage state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative models to estimate counterfactual outcomes. Our approach compares these causal attributions with closely related associational attributions, both theoretically and empirically. We demonstrate the insights gained by our approach for a diverse set of qualitatively different time series classification tasks. Although causal and associational attributions might often share some similarities, in all cases they differ in important details, underscoring the risks associated with drawing causal conclusions from associational data alone. We believe that the proposed approach is widely applicable also in other domains, particularly where predefined segmentations are available, to shed some light on the limits of associational attributions.">

        <tr id="Learning-based methods have become increasingly popular for solving vehicle routing problems due to their near-optimal performance and fast inference speed. Among them, the combination of deep reinforcement learning and graph representation allows for the abstraction of node topology structures and features in an encoder-decoder style. Such an approach makes it possible to solve routing problems end-to-end without needing complicated heuristic operators designed by domain experts. Existing research studies have been focusing on novel encoding and decoding structures via various neural network models to enhance the node embedding representation. Despite the sophisticated approaches applied, there is a noticeable lack of consideration for the graph-theoretic properties inherent to routing problems. Moreover, the potential ramifications of inter-nodal interactions on the decision-making efficacy of the models have not been adequately explored. To bridge this gap, we propose an adaptive Graph Attention Sampling with the Edges Fusion framework (GASE),where nodes' embedding is determined through attention calculation from certain highly correlated neighbourhoods and edges, utilizing a filtered adjacency matrix. In detail, the selections of particular neighbours and adjacency edges are led by a multi-head attention mechanism, contributing directly to the message passing and node embedding in graph attention sampling networks. Furthermore, we incorporate an adaptive actor-critic algorithm with policy improvements to expedite the training convergence. We then conduct comprehensive experiments against baseline methods on learning-based VRP tasks from different perspectives. Our proposed model outperforms the existing methods by 2.08\%-6.23\% and shows stronger generalization ability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on randomly generated instances and real-world datasets.">

Consequently, finding a balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper, we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2) providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.">

Here, we present Multiway Multislice PHATE (MM-PHATE), a novel method for visualizing the evolution of RNNs' hidden states. MM-PHATE is a graph-based embedding using structured kernels across the multiple dimensions spanned by RNNs: time, training epoch, and units. We demonstrate on various datasets that MM-PHATE uniquely preserves hidden representation community structure among units and identifies information processing and compression phases during training. The embedding allows users to look under the hood of RNNs across training and provides an intuitive and comprehensive strategy to understanding the network's internal dynamics and draw conclusions, e.g., on why and how one model outperforms another or how a specific architecture might impact an RNN's learning ability.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces alternators, a novel family of non-Markovian dynamical models for sequences. An alternator features two neural networks: the observation trajectory network (OTN) and the feature trajectory network (FTN). The OTN and the FTN work in conjunction, alternating between outputting samples in the observation space and some feature space, respectively, over a cycle. The parameters of the OTN and the FTN are not time-dependent and are learned via a minimum cross-entropy criterion over the trajectories. Alternators are versatile. They can be used as dynamical latent-variable generative models or as sequence-to-sequence predictors. When alternators are used as generative models, the FTN produces interpretable low-dimensional latent variables that capture the dynamics governing the observations. When alternators are used as sequence-to-sequence predictors, the FTN learns to predict the observed features. In both cases, the OTN learns to produce sequences that match the data. Alternators can uncover the latent dynamics underlying complex sequential data, accurately forecast and impute missing data, and sample new trajectories. We showcase the capabilities of alternators in three applications. We first used alternators to model the Lorenz equations, often used to describe chaotic behavior. We then applied alternators to Neuroscience, to map brain activity to physical activity. Finally, we applied alternators to Climate Science, focusing on sea-surface temperature forecasting. In all our experiments, we found alternators are stable to train, fast to sample from, yield high-quality generated samples and latent variables, and outperform strong baselines such as neural ODEs and diffusion models in the domains we studied.">

However, classical GNNs face scalability challenges when dealing with large-scale graphs. This paper proposes frameworks for implementing GNNs on quantum computers to potentially address the challenges. We devise quantum algorithms corresponding to the three fundamental types of classical GNNs: Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks, and Message-Passing GNNs. A complexity analysis of our quantum implementation of the Simplified Graph Convolutional (SGC) Network shows potential quantum advantages over its classical counterpart, with significant improvements in time and space complexities. Our complexities can have trade-offs between the two: when optimizing for minimal circuit depth, our quantum SGC achieves logarithmic time complexity in the input sizes (albeit at the cost of linear space complexity). When optimizing for minimal qubit usage, the quantum SGC exhibits space complexity logarithmic in the input sizes, offering an exponential reduction compared to classical SGCs, while still maintaining better time complexity. These results suggest our Quantum GNN frameworks could efficiently process large-scale graphs.

However, these models still underperform transformers especially on tasks that require in-context retrieval. While more expressive variants of linear transformers which replace the additive outer-product update in linear transformers with the delta rule have been found to be more effective at associative recall, existing algorithms for training such models do not parallelize over sequence length and are thus inefficient to train on modern hardware. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for training linear transformers with the delta rule, which exploits a memory-efficient representation for computing products of Householder matrices. This algorithm allows us to scale up DeltaNet to standard language modeling settings. We train a 1.3B model for 100B tokens and find that it outperforms recent linear-time baselines such as Mamba and GLA in terms of perplexity and zero-shot performance on downstream tasks (including on tasks that focus on recall). We also experiment with two hybrid models which combine DeltaNet layers with (1) sliding-window attention layers every other layer or (2) two global attention layers, and find that these hybrid models outperform strong transformer baselines.">

        <tr id="Time-series analysis plays a pivotal role across a range of critical applications, from finance to healthcare, which involves various tasks, such as forecasting and classification. To handle the inherent complexities of time-series data, such as high dimensionality and noise, traditional supervised learning methods first annotate extensive labels for time-series data in each task, which is very costly and impractical in real-world applications. In contrast, pre-trained foundation models offer a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data to capture general time series patterns, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, existing approaches to pre-training such models typically suffer from high-bias and low-generality issues due to the use of predefined and rigid augmentation operations and domain-specific data training. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces UniCL, a universal and scalable contrastive learning framework designed for pretraining time-series foundation models across cross-domain datasets. Specifically, we propose a unified and trainable time-series augmentation operation to generate pattern-preserved, diverse, and low-bias time-series data by leveraging spectral information. Besides, we introduce a scalable augmentation algorithm capable of handling datasets with varying lengths, facilitating cross-domain pretraining. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across eleven domains validate the effectiveness of UniCL, demonstrating its high generalization on time-series analysis across various fields.">

        <tr id="The proliferation of rumors on social media platforms during significant events, such as the US elections and the COVID-19 pandemic, has a profound impact on social stability and public health. Existing approaches for rumor detection primarily rely on propagation graphs to enhance model effectiveness. However, the presence of noisy and irrelevant structures during the propagation process limits the efficacy of these approaches. To tackle this issue, techniques such as weight adjustment and data augmentation have been proposed. However, these techniques heavily depend on rich original propagation structures, thus hindering performance when dealing with rumors that lack sufficient propagation information in the early propagation stages. In this paper, we propose Key Propagation Graph Generator (KPG), a novel reinforcement learning-based rumor detection framework that generates contextually coherent and informative propagation patterns for events with insufficient topology information, while also identifies indicative substructures for events with redundant and noisy propagation structures. KPG consists of two key components: the Candidate Response Generator (CRG) and the Ending Node Selector (ENS). CRG learns the latent distribution from refined propagation patterns, filtering out noise and generating new candidates for ENS. Simultaneously, ENS identifies the most influential substructures within propagation graphs and generates training data for CRG. Moreover, we introduce an end-to-end framework that utilizes rewards to guide the entire training process via a pre-trained graph neural network. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KPG compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.">

Resource load prediction is a prominent challenge issue with the widespread adoption of cloud computing. A novel cloud computing load prediction method has been proposed, the Double-channel residual Self-attention Temporal convolutional Network with Weight adaptive updating (DSTNW), in order to make the response of the container cluster more rapid and accurate. A Double-channel Temporal Convolution Network model (DTN) has been developed to capture long-term sequence dependencies and enhance feature extraction capabilities when the model handles long load sequences. Double-channel dilated causal convolution has been adopted to replace the single-channel dilated causal convolution in the DTN. A residual temporal self-attention mechanism (SM) has been proposed to improve the performance of the network and focus on features with significant contributions from the DTN. DTN and SM jointly constitute a dual-channel residual self-attention temporal convolutional network (DSTN). In addition, by evaluating the accuracy aspects of single and stacked DSTNs, an adaptive weight strategy has been proposed to assign corresponding weights for the single and stacked DSTNs, respectively. The experimental results highlight that the developed method has outstanding prediction performance for cloud computing in comparison with some state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method achieved an average improvement of 24.16% and 30.48% on the Container dataset and Google dataset, respectively.">

        <tr id="Urban land use inference is a critically important task that aids in city planning and policy-making. Recently, the increased use of sensor and location technologies has facilitated the collection of multi-modal mobility data, offering valuable insights into daily activity patterns. Many studies have adopted advanced data-driven techniques to explore the potential of these multi-modal mobility data in land use inference. However, existing studies often process samples independently, ignoring the spatial correlations among neighbouring objects and heterogeneity among different services. Furthermore, the inherently low interpretability of complex deep learning methods poses a significant barrier in urban planning, where transparency and extrapolability are crucial for making long-term policy decisions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an explainable framework for inferring land use that synergises heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNs) with Explainable AI techniques, enhancing both accuracy and explainability. The empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed HGNs significantly outperform baseline graph neural networks for all six land-use indicators, especially in terms of 'office' and 'sustenance'. As explanations, we consider feature attribution and counterfactual explanations. The analysis of feature attribution explanations shows that the symmetrical nature of the `residence' and 'work' categories predicted by the framework aligns well with the commuter's 'work' and 'recreation' activities in London. The analysis of the counterfactual explanations reveals that variations in node features and types are primarily responsible for the differences observed between the predicted land use distribution and the ideal mixed state. These analyses demonstrate that the proposed HGNs can suitably support urban stakeholders in their urban planning and policy-making.">

The link prediction in edge-incomplete graphs aims to discover the missing relations between entities when their relationships are represented as a graph. Edge-incomplete graphs are prevalent in real-world due to practical limitations, such as not checking all users when adding friends in a social network. Addressing the problem is crucial for various tasks, including recommending friends in social networks and finding references in citation networks. However, previous approaches rely heavily on the given edge-incomplete (observed) graph, making it challenging to consider the missing (unobserved) links during training. In this paper, we propose PULL (PU-Learning-based Link predictor), an accurate link prediction method based on the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. PULL treats the observed edges in the training graph as positive examples, and the unconnected node pairs as unlabeled ones. PULL effectively prevents the link predictor from overfitting to the observed graph by proposing latent variables for every edge, and leveraging the expected graph structure with respect to the variables. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PULL consistently outperforms the baselines for predicting links in edge-incomplete graphs.">

Most AutoML tools solve the problem of building models for classification and regression tasks based on data attributes without considering changes in a parameter over time. However, several systems already exist that automate the search of models for the time series forecasting problem.

        <tr id="Due to the performance degradation of graph neural networks (GNNs) under distribution shifts, the work on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs has received widespread attention. A novel perspective involves distinguishing potential confounding biases from different environments through environmental identification, enabling the model to escape environmentally-sensitive correlations and maintain stable performance under distribution shifts. However, in graph data, confounding factors not only affect the generation process of node features but also influence the complex interaction between nodes. We observe that neglecting either aspect of them will lead to a decrease in performance. In this paper, we propose IENE, an OOD generalization method on graphs based on node-level environmental identification and extrapolation techniques. It strengthens the model's ability to extract invariance from two granularities simultaneously, leading to improved generalization. Specifically, to identify invariance in features, we utilize the disentangled information bottleneck framework to achieve mutual promotion between node-level environmental estimation and invariant feature learning. Furthermore, we extrapolate topological environments through graph augmentation techniques to identify structural invariance. We implement the conceptual method with specific algorithms and provide theoretical analysis and proofs for our approach. Extensive experimental evaluations on two synthetic and four real-world OOD datasets validate the superiority of IENE, which outperforms existing techniques and provides a flexible framework for enhancing the generalization of GNNs.">

        <tr id="Identification of critical nodes is a prominent topic in the study of complex networks. Numerous methods have been proposed, yet most exhibit inherent limitations. Traditional approaches primarily analyze specific structural features of the network; however, node influence is typically the result of a combination of multiple factors. Machine learning-based methods struggle to effectively represent the complex characteristics of network structures through suitable embedding techniques and require substantial data for training, rendering them prohibitively costly for large-scale networks. To address these challenges, this paper presents an active learning model based on GraphSAGE and Transformer, named GNNTAL. This model is initially pre-trained on random or synthetic networks and subsequently fine-tuned on real-world networks by selecting a few representative nodes using K-Means clustering and uncertainty sampling. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it significantly reduces training costs; (2) it simultaneously incorporates both local and global features. A series of comparative experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks demonstrate that GNNTAL achieves superior performance. Additionally, this paper proposes an influence maximization method based on the predictions of the GNNTAL model, which achieves optimal performance without the need for complex computations. Finally, the paper analyses certain limitations of the GNNTAL model and suggests potential solutions.">

Our method offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out sequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training horizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that uniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing's variable-horizon and causal architecture, and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and planning tasks.

These datasets inherently exhibit non-stationarity as their distributions vary over time. Furthermore, the intricate inter- and intra-series relationships among data points pose challenges for modeling.

This study proposes a novel TSF model designed to address the challenges posed by real-life data, delivering accurate forecasts in both multivariate and univariate settings. First, we propose methods termed “weak-stationarizing” and “non-stationarity restoring” to mitigate distributional shift. These methods enable the removal and restoration of non-stationary components from individual data points as needed. Second, we utilize the spectral decomposition of weak-stationary time series to extract informative features for forecasting. To learn features from the spectral decomposition of weak-stationary time series, we exploit a mixer architecture to find inter- and intra-series dependencies from the unraveled representation of the overall time series. To ensure the efficacy of our model, we conduct comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art models using six real-world datasets spanning diverse fields.

This paper introduces a novel deep time series clustering approach integrating VAE with metric learning. It leverages a VAE based on Gated Recurrent Units for temporal feature extraction, incorporates metric learning for joint optimization of latent space representation, and employs the sum of log likelihoods as the clustering merging criterion, markedly improving clustering accuracy and interpretability. Experimental findings demonstrate a 27.16% improvement in average clustering accuracy and a 47.15% increase in speed on industrial load data. This study offers novel insights and tools for the thorough analysis and application of time series data, with further exploration of VAE’s potential in time series clustering anticipated in future research.">

        <tr id="We present a neural operator architecture to simulate Lagrangian dynamics, such as fluid flow, granular flows, and elastoplasticity. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

        <tr id="Transformer architectures have been widely adopted in foundation models. Due to their high inference costs, there is renewed interest in exploring the potential of efficient recurrent architectures (RNNs). In this paper, we analyze the differences in the representational capabilities of Transformers and RNNs across several tasks of practical relevance, including index lookup, nearest neighbor, recognizing bounded Dyck languages, and string equality. For the tasks considered, our results show separations based on the size of the model required for different architectures. For example, we show that a one-layer Transformer of logarithmic width can perform index lookup, whereas an RNN requires a hidden state of linear size. Conversely, while constant-size RNNs can recognize bounded Dyck languages, we show that one-layer Transformers require a linear size for this task. Furthermore, we show that two-layer Transformers of logarithmic size can perform decision tasks such as string equality or disjointness, whereas both one-layer Transformers and recurrent models require linear size for these tasks. We also show that a log-size two-layer Transformer can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm in its forward pass; on the other hand recurrent models require linear size. Our constructions are based on the existence of $N$ nearly orthogonal vectors in $O(\log N)$ dimensional space and our lower bounds are based on reductions from communication complexity problems. We supplement our theoretical results with experiments that highlight the differences in the performance of these architectures on practical-size sequences.">

We introduce GraphArena, a benchmarking tool designed to evaluate LLMs on graph computational problems using million-scale real-world graphs from diverse scenarios such as knowledge graphs, social networks, and molecular structures. GraphArena offers a suite of 10 computational tasks, encompassing four polynomial-time (e.g., Shortest Distance) and six NP-complete challenges (e.g., Travelling Salesman Problem). It features a rigorous evaluation framework that classifies LLM outputs as correct, suboptimal (feasible but not optimal), or hallucinatory (properly formatted but infeasible). Evaluation of 10 leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B-Instruct, reveals that even top-performing models struggle with larger, more complex graph problems and exhibit hallucination issues. Despite the application of strategies such as chain-of-thought prompting, these issues remain unresolved. GraphArena contributes a valuable supplement to the existing LLM benchmarks and is open-sourced at https://github.com/squareRoot3/GraphArena.">

For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique, which are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs. However, existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DyGPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and dynamic variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DyGPrompt through extensive experiments on three public datasets.">

Today, forecasts can be generated via Gen-AI models without the need for an in-depth understanding of forecasting theory, practice, or coding. Therefore, using three datasets, we present a comparative analysis of forecasts from Gen-AI models against forecasts from seven univariate and automated models from the forecast package in R, covering both parametric and non-parametric forecasting techniques. In some cases, we find statistically significant evidence to conclude that forecasts from Gen-AI models can outperform forecasts from popular benchmarks like seasonal ARIMA, seasonal naïve, exponential smoothing, and Theta forecasts (to name a few). Our findings also indicate that the accuracy of forecasts from Gen-AI models can vary not only based on the underlying data structure but also on the quality of prompt engineering (thus highlighting the continued importance of forecasting education), with the forecast accuracy appearing to improve at longer horizons. Therefore, we find some evidence towards promoting forecasts from Gen-AI models as benchmarks in future forecasting practice. However, at present, users are cautioned against reliability issues and Gen-AI being a black box in some cases.">

        <tr id="Node classification is a fundamental task, but obtaining node classification labels can be challenging and expensive in many real-world scenarios. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising solution to address this challenge by leveraging knowledge from source domains to enhance learning in a target domain. Existing transfer learning methods for node classification primarily focus on integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with various transfer learning techniques. While these approaches have shown promising results, they often suffer from a lack of theoretical guarantees, restrictive conditions, and high sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Graph Convolutional Multinomial Logistic Regression (GCR) model and a transfer learning method based on the GCR model, called Trans-GCR. We provide theoretical guarantees of the estimate obtained under GCR model in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, Trans-GCR demonstrates superior empirical performance, has a low computational cost, and requires fewer hyperparameters than existing methods.">

While the consideration of external techno-economic features could improve the modeling of the short-term dynamics of grid frequency, such features are often only recorded on an hourly basis and require careful treatment. We present a purely data-driven approach to modeling grid frequency as an alternative to prediction models incorporating physical characteristics of power systems. Using sequence models such as gated recurrent units and transformers, we extract the necessary information and relationships from the static frequency vector to predict the process parameters for the short-term dynamics of frequency following a Gaussian process. Both for the evaluation measures (e.g. MSE, MAE, RMSE) for point estimators and for the measures for probalistic evaluations (e.g. Negative Log Likelihood Score, CPRS and Energy Score), our prediction performance is comparable to state-of-the-art models and outperforms various purely data-driven models such as daily profiles and k-nearest-neighbour profiles. Moreover, synthetic time series generated by our models can successfully reproduce the main statistical characteristics of the grid frequency.">

        <tr id="There is an important challenge in systematically interpreting the internal representations of deep neural networks. This study introduces a multi-dimensional quantification and visualization approach which can capture two temporal dimensions of a model learning experience: the “information processing trajectory” and the “developmental trajectory.” The former represents the influence of incoming signals on an agent’s decision-making, while the latter conceptualizes the gradual improvement in an agent’s performance throughout its lifespan. Tracking the learning curves of a DNN enables researchers to explicitly identify the model appropriateness of a given task, examine the properties of the underlying input signals, and assess the model’s alignment (or lack thereof) with human learning experiences. To illustrate the method, we conducted 750 runs of simulations on two temporal tasks: gesture detection and natural language processing (NLP) classification, showcasing its applicability across a spectrum of deep learning tasks. Based on the quantitative analysis of the learning curves across two distinct datasets, we have identified three insights gained from mapping these curves: nonlinearity, pairwise comparisons, and domain distinctions. We reflect on the theoretical implications of this method for cognitive processing, language models and multimodal representation. Author summary Deep learning networks, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are designed for processing incoming signals sequentially, making them intuitive computational systems for studying cognitive processing that involves dynamic contexts. There has been a tradition in the fields of machine learning and neuro-cognitive science to examine how a system (either humans or models) represents information through various computational and statistical techniques. Our study takes this one step further by devising a technique for examining the “learning curves” of deep learning networks utilizing the sequential representations as part of RNNs’ architectures. Just as humans develop learning curves when solving problems, the introduced method captures both how incoming signals help improve decision-making and how a system’s problem-solving abilities enhance when encountering the same situation multiple times throughout its lifespan. Our study selected two distinct tasks: gesture detection and emotion tweet classification, to illustrate the insights researchers can draw from mapping models’ learning curves. The proposed method hinted that gesture learning experiences are smoother, while language learning relies on sudden knowledge gains during processing, corroborating the findings from previous literature.">

To address this, we propose a Time-Series Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA) and a semantic actor trained through self-supervised learning. This approach harnesses TS-JEPA's semantic representation power and predictive capabilities by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in the source data.

Firstly, the framework preprocesses the raw data, extracting and recording timestamp information between interactions. It then introduces the concept of “Temporal Information Entropy (TIE)”, integrating it into the Node2Vec algorithm’s random walk to generate initial feature vectors for nodes in the graph. A causality analysis model is subsequently applied for secondary processing of the generated feature vectors. Following this, an equal dataset is constructed by adjusting the ratio of positive and negative samples. Lastly, a dedicated GCN model is used for model training. Through extensive experimentation in multiple real social networks, the framework proposed in this study demonstrated a better performance than other methods in key evaluation indicators such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. This study provides a fresh perspective for understanding and predicting link dynamics in social networks and has significant practical value.">

        <tr id="Score-based diffusion models have recently emerged as state-of-the-art generative models for a variety of data modalities. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how to adapt these models to generate long multivariate time series. Viewing a time series as the discretization of an underlying continuous process, we introduce SigDiffusion, a novel diffusion model operating on log-signature embeddings of the data. The forward and backward processes gradually perturb and denoise log-signatures preserving their algebraic structure. To recover a signal from its log-signature, we provide new closed-form inversion formulae expressing the coefficients obtained by expanding the signal in a given basis (e.g. Fourier or orthogonal polynomials) as explicit polynomial functions of the log-signature. Finally, we show that combining SigDiffusion with these inversion formulae results in highly realistic time series generation, competitive with the current state-of-the-art on various datasets of synthetic and real-world examples.">

        <tr id="This paper is on long-term video understanding where the goal is to recognise human actions over long temporal windows (up to minutes long). In prior work, long temporal context is captured by constructing a long-term memory bank consisting of past and future video features which are then integrated into standard (short-term) video recognition backbones through the use of attention mechanisms. Two well-known problems related to this approach are the quadratic complexity of the attention operation and the fact that the whole feature bank must be stored in memory for inference. To address both issues, we propose an alternative to attention-based schemes which is based on a low-rank approximation of the memory obtained using Singular Value Decomposition. Our scheme has two advantages: (a) it reduces complexity by more than an order of magnitude, and (b) it is amenable to an efficient implementation for the calculation of the memory bases in an incremental fashion which does not require the storage of the whole feature bank in memory. The proposed scheme matches or surpasses the accuracy achieved by attention-based mechanisms while being memory-efficient. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework generalises to different architectures and tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art in three datasets.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how several E(n) equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different nature: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The experiment results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, highlighting the benefits of principled geometric inductive bias.">

        <tr id="Accurate aggregated baseline load (ABL) estimation is crucial for demand response implementation. Traditional ABL estimation methods (e.g., averaging, regression, etc.) ignore the spatial correlation between different customer load patterns, thus leading to large errors in the estimation results. The Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)-based ABL estimation method solves the above problems to a certain extent, however, the graphs it uses to capture the spatial correlations between different customer load patterns are completely human-defined with strong subjectivity of the constructor, so the mining of spatial correlations by this method is still not sufficiently objective and adequate, and the accuracy of the estimation results needs to be further improved. Based on this, this paper proposes an ABL estimation method based on Graph Structure Learning (GSL) and GCN. The method firstly defines the nodes and edges of the graph artificially, and then learns to obtain the adjacency matrix of the graph using the GSL algorithm. The graph obtained in this way is less subjective by the constructor than the one completely defined by man, and thus more fully exploits the spatial correlation between the data, which in turn improves the estimation accuracy of the method. Case studies on a real load dataset verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.">

        <tr id="We introduce and detail an atypical neural network architecture, called time elastic neural network (teNN), for multivariate time series classification. The novelty compared to classical neural network architecture is that it explicitly incorporates time warping ability, as well as a new way of considering attention. In addition, this architecture is capable of learning a dropout strategy, thus optimizing its own architecture.Behind the design of this architecture, our overall objective is threefold: firstly, we are aiming at improving the accuracy of instance based classification approaches that shows quite good performances as far as enough training data is available. Secondly we seek to reduce the computational complexity inherent to these methods to improve their scalability. Ideally, we seek to find an acceptable balance between these first two criteria. And finally, we seek to enhance the explainability of the decision provided by this kind of neural architecture.The experiment demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent implemented to train a teNN is quite effective. To the extent that the selection of some critical meta-parameters is correct, convergence is generally smooth and fast.While maintaining good accuracy, we get a drastic gain in scalability by first reducing the required number of reference time series, i.e. the number of teNN cells required. Secondly, we demonstrate that, during the training process, the teNN succeeds in reducing the number of neurons required within each cell. Finally, we show that the analysis of the activation and attention matrices as well as the reference time series after training provides relevant information to interpret and explain the classification results.The comparative study that we have carried out and which concerns around thirty diverse and multivariate datasets shows that the teNN obtains results comparable to those of the state of the art, in particular similar to those of a network mixing LSTM and CNN architectures for example.">

Local processing and learning typically demand intensive computations and massive storage as the process involves retrieving information and tuning hundreds of parameters back in time. In this work, we developed a memristor-based echo state network accelerator that features efficient temporal data processing and in-situ online learning. The proposed design is benchmarked using various datasets involving real-world tasks, such as forecasting the load energy consumption and weather conditions. The experimental results illustrate that the hardware model experiences a marginal degradation (~4.8%) in performance as compared to the software model. This is mainly attributed to the limited precision and dynamic range of network parameters when emulated using memristor devices. The proposed system is evaluated for lifespan, robustness, and energy-delay product. It is observed that the system demonstrates a reasonable robustness for device failure below 10%, which may occur due to stuck-at faults. Furthermore, 246X reduction in energy consumption is achieved when compared to a custom CMOS digital design implemented at the same technology node.">

Precise forecasts aid in managing and optimizing transportation systems, reducing congestion, and improving air quality by cutting emissions. However, predicting outcomes is difficult due to intricate spatial relationships, nonlinear temporal patterns, and the challenges associated with long-term forecasting. Current research often uses static graph structures, overlooking dynamic and long-range dependencies. To tackle these issues, we introduce the spatiotemporal dynamic multi-hop network (ST-DMN), a Seq2Seq framework. This model incorporates spatiotemporal convolutional blocks (ST-Blocks) with residual connections in the encoder to condense historical traffic data into a fixed-dimensional vector. A dynamic graph represents time-varying inter-segment relationships, and multi-hop operation in the encoder’s spatial convolutional layer and the decoder’s diffusion multi-hop graph convolutional gated recurrent units (DMGCGRUs) capture long-range dependencies. Experiments on two real-world datasets METR-LA and PEMS-BAY show that ST-DMN surpasses existing models in three metrics.">

Domain knowledge is particularly important in real-world scenarios, where invalid generated graphs hinder deployment in practical applications. Unconstrained and conditioned graph generative models fail to guarantee such domain-specific structural properties. We present ConStruct, a novel framework that allows for hard-constraining graph diffusion models to incorporate specific properties, such as planarity or acyclicity. Our approach ensures that the sampled graphs remain within the domain of graphs that verify the specified property throughout the entire trajectory in both the forward and reverse processes. This is achieved by introducing a specific edge-absorbing noise model and a new projector operator. ConStruct demonstrates versatility across several structural and edge-deletion invariant constraints and achieves state-of-the-art performance for both synthetic benchmarks and attributed real-world datasets. For example, by leveraging planarity in digital pathology graph datasets, the proposed method outperforms existing baselines and enhances generated data validity by up to 71.1 percentage points.">

To address this, we collected and released three real-world biological datasets and developed a multi-label graph generator with tunable properties. We also argue that traditional notions of homophily and heterophily do not apply well to multi-label scenarios. Therefore, we define homophily and Cross-Class Neighborhood Similarity for multi-label classification and investigate $9$ collected multi-label datasets. Lastly, we conducted a large-scale comparative study with $8$ methods across nine datasets to evaluate current progress in multi-label node classification.

A preliminary stage involves estimating a Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) model to capture correlations among the involved time series. This stage also involves statistical checks, such as stationarity and residual autocorrelations, in order to build a consistent model to be used for prediction. In the second stage, we employ a set of recurrent neural networks (simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU) to predict the behavior of selected QoS/QoE metrics. This choice is motivated by the fact that such techniques are able to handle temporal sequences, owing to their cell memory structure. Then, the employed techniques are contrasted in terms of both their offered performance and required computational time. Results provide valuable insights for constructing realistic traffic models (not artificially simulated ones) and useful information for network providers looking to optimize their resources based on usage patterns.">

While most current machine learning models focus on deterministic forecasts, accurately capturing the uncertainty in the chaotic weather system calls for probabilistic modeling. We propose a probabilistic weather forecasting model called Graph-EFM, combining a flexible latent-variable formulation with the successful graph-based forecasting framework. The use of a hierarchical graph construction allows for efficient sampling of spatially coherent forecasts. Requiring only a single forward pass per time step, Graph-EFM allows for fast generation of arbitrarily large ensembles. We experiment with the model on both global and limited area forecasting. Ensemble forecasts from Graph-EFM achieve equivalent or lower errors than comparable deterministic models, with the added benefit of accurately capturing forecast uncertainty.">

        <tr id="Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) addresses the challenge of training predictive models under temporally varying data distributions. Traditional TDG approaches typically focus on domain data collected at fixed, discrete time intervals, which limits their capability to capture the inherent dynamics within continuous-evolving and irregularly-observed temporal domains. To overcome this, this work formalizes the concept of Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), where domain data are derived from continuous times and are collected at arbitrary times. CTDG tackles critical challenges including: 1) Characterizing the continuous dynamics of both data and models, 2) Learning complex high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and 3) Optimizing and controlling the generalization across continuous temporal domains. To address them, we propose a Koopman operator-driven continuous temporal domain generalization (Koodos) framework. We formulate the problem within a continuous dynamic system and leverage the Koopman theory to learn the underlying dynamics; the framework is further enhanced with a comprehensive optimization strategy equipped with analysis and control driven by prior knowledge of the dynamics patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.">

        <tr id="Temporal data modelling techniques with neural networks are useful in many domain applications, including time-series forecasting and control engineering. This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.">

        <tr id="The Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model offers a general framework for capturing dynamics and predicting transition points in diverse natural and social systems. In this work, we present two calibration techniques for the LPPLS model using deep learning. First, we introduce the Mono-LPPLS-NN (M-LNN) model; for any given empirical time series, a unique M-LNN model is trained and shown to outperform state-of-the-art techniques in estimating the nonlinear parameters $(t_c, m, \omega)$ of the LPPLS model as evidenced by the comprehensive distribution of parameter errors. Second, we extend the M-LNN model to a more general model architecture, the Poly-LPPLS-NN (P-LNN), which is able to quickly estimate the nonlinear parameters of the LPPLS model for any given time-series of a fixed length, including previously unseen time-series during training. The Poly class of models train on many synthetic LPPLS time-series augmented with various noise structures in a supervised manner. Given enough training examples, the P-LNN models also outperform state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the parameters of the LPPLS model as evidenced by the comprehensive distribution of parameter errors. Additionally, this class of models is shown to substantially reduce the time to obtain parameter estimates. Finally, we present applications to the diagnostic and prediction of two financial bubble peaks (followed by their crash) and of a famous rockslide. These contributions provide a bridge between deep learning and the study of the prediction of transition times in complex time series.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces a novel forecastings technique based on randomized fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM), called LRHFCM (or large reservoir of randomized high-order FCM) for predicting univariate time series. LR-HFCM is a hybrid method combining fuzzy time series (FTS), FCMs, and reservoir computing. It is a type of echo state network (ESN) consisting of the input layer, intermediate (or large reservoir) layer, and output layer, where LASSO regression is applied to train the output layer. The novelty of this approach is that the internal layer includes a very large reservoir, considering different combinations from the sets of concepts and order using a certain number of sub-reservoirs to capture different dynamics of input time series. It is important to highlight that the weights within each sub-reservoir are chosen randomly and remain constant throughout the training process. The validity of the LR-HFCM approach is evaluated across 15 different time series datasets. The results highlight the outperformance of the LR-HFCM technique in comparison to various baseline models.">

        <tr id="While time series data are prevalent across diverse sectors, data labeling process still remains resource-intensive. This results in a scarcity of labeled data for deep learning, emphasizing the importance of semi-supervised learning techniques. Applying semi-supervised learning to time series data presents unique challenges due to its inherent temporal complexities. Efficient contrastive learning for time series requires specialized methods, particularly in the development of tailored data augmentation techniques. In this paper, we propose a single-step, semi-supervised contrastive learning framework named nearest neighbor contrastive learning for time series (NNCLR-TS). Specifically, the proposed framework incorporates a support set to store representations including their label information, enabling a pseudo-labeling of the unlabeled data based on nearby samples in the latent space. Moreover, our framework presents a novel data augmentation method, which selectively augments only the trend component of the data, effectively preserving their inherent periodic properties and facilitating effective training. For training, we introduce a novel contrastive loss that utilizes the nearest neighbors of augmented data for positive and negative representations. By employing our framework, we unlock the ability to attain high-quality embeddings and achieve remarkable performance in downstream classification tasks, tailored explicitly for time series. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across various benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.">

Finally, the supervised dynamic principal component analysis (sdPCA) method is adopted to account for the dynamic information in factor recovery. In simulation studies, we found that the proposed method adapts well to unknown degrees of sparsity and factor strength, which results in good performance even when the number of relevant predictors is large compared to the sample size. Applying to economic and environmental studies, the proposed method consistently performs well compared to some commonly used benchmarks in one-step-ahead out-sample forecasts.">

These data encapsulate crucial information in essential climate variables, such as varying levels of soil moisture and temperature. However, current cutting-edge machine learning models, including deep learning ones, often overlook the treasure trove of multidimensional data, thus analyzing each variable in isolation and losing critical interconnected information. In our study, we enhance conventional convolutional neural network models, specifically those based on the embedded temporal convolutional network framework, thus transforming them into models that inherently understand and interpret multidimensional correlations and dependencies. This transformation involves recasting the existing problem as a generalized case of N-dimensional observation analysis, which is followed by deriving essential forward and backward pass equations through tensor decompositions and compounded convolutions. Consequently, we adapt integral components of established embedded temporal convolutional network models, like encoder and decoder networks, thus enabling them to process 4D spatial time series data that encompass all essential climate variables concurrently. Through the rigorous exploration of diverse model architectures and an extensive evaluation of their forecasting prowess against top-tier methods, we utilize two new, long-term essential climate variables datasets with monthly intervals extending over four decades. Our empirical scrutiny, particularly focusing on soil temperature data, unveils that the innovative high-dimensional embedded temporal convolutional network model-centric approaches markedly excel in forecasting, thus surpassing their low-dimensional counterparts, even under the most challenging conditions characterized by a notable paucity of training data.">

This work explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternative to domain experts for causal graph generation. We frame conditional independence queries as prompts to LLMs and employ the PC algorithm with the answers. The performance of the LLM-based conditional independence oracle on systems with known causal graphs shows a high degree of variability. We improve the performance through a proposed statistical-inspired voting schema that allows some control over false-positive and false-negative rates. Inspecting the chain-of-thought argumentation, we find causal reasoning to justify its answer to a probabilistic query.

        <tr id="Effectively learning from sequential data is a longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the case of long sequences. From the dawn of Machine Learning, several researchers engaged in the search of algorithms and architectures capable of processing sequences of patterns, retaining information about the past inputs while still leveraging the upcoming data, without losing precious long-term dependencies and correlations. While such an ultimate goal is inspired by the human hallmark of continuous real-time processing of sensory information, several solutions simplified the learning paradigm by artificially limiting the processed context or dealing with sequences of limited length, given in advance. These solutions were further emphasized by the large ubiquity of Transformers, that have initially shaded the role of Recurrent Neural Nets. However, recurrent networks are facing a strong recent revival due to the growing popularity of (deep) State-Space models and novel instances of large-context Transformers, which are both based on recurrent computations to go beyond several limits of currently ubiquitous technologies. In fact, the fast development of Large Language Models enhanced the interest in efficient solutions to process data over time. This survey provides an in-depth summary of the latest approaches that are based on recurrent models for sequential data processing. A complete taxonomy over the latest trends in architectural and algorithmic solutions is reported and discussed, guiding researchers in this appealing research field. The emerging picture suggests that there is room for thinking of novel routes, constituted by learning algorithms which depart from the standard Backpropagation Through Time, towards a more realistic scenario where patterns are effectively processed online, leveraging local-forward computations, opening to further research on this topic.">

        <tr id="A recent development in deep learning techniques has attracted attention to the decoding and classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Despite several efforts to utilize different features in EEG signals, a significant research challenge is using time-dependent features in combination with local and global features. Several attempts have been made to remodel the deep learning convolution neural networks (CNNs) to capture time-dependency information. These features are usually either handcrafted features, such as power ratios, or splitting data into smaller-sized windows related to specific properties, such as a peak at 300 ms. However, these approaches partially solve the problem but simultaneously hinder CNNs' capability to learn from unknown information that might be present in the data. Other approaches, like recurrent neural networks, are very suitable for learning time-dependent information from EEG signals in the presence of unrelated sequential data. To solve this, we have proposed an encoding kernel (EnK), a novel time-encoding approach, which uniquely introduces time decomposition information during the vertical convolution operation in CNNs. The encoded information lets CNNs learn time-dependent features in addition to local and global features. We performed extensive experiments on several EEG data sets—physical human-robot collaborations, P300 visual-evoked potentials, motor imagery, movement-related cortical potentials, and the Dataset for Emotion Analysis Using Physiological Signals. The EnK outperforms the state of the art with an up to 6.5% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) and a 9.5% improvement in F1-scores compared to the average for all data sets together compared to base models. These results support our approach and show a high potential to improve the performance of physiological and non-physiological data. Moreover, the EnK can be applied to virtually any deep learning architecture with minimal effort.">

        <tr id="Machine learning for node classification on graphs is a prominent area driven by applications such as recommendation systems. State-of-the-art models often use multiple graph convolutions on the data, as empirical evidence suggests they can enhance performance. However, it has been shown empirically and theoretically, that too many graph convolutions can degrade performance significantly, a phenomenon known as oversmoothing. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, based on the contextual stochastic block model (CSBM), of the performance of vanilla graph convolution from which we remove the principal eigenvector to avoid oversmoothing. We perform a spectral analysis for $k$ rounds of corrected graph convolutions, and we provide results for partial and exact classification. For partial classification, we show that each round of convolution can reduce the misclassification error exponentially up to a saturation level, after which performance does not worsen. For exact classification, we show that the separability threshold can be improved exponentially up to $O({\log{n}}/{\log\log{n}})$ corrected convolutions.">

        <tr id="Through integrating the evolutionary correlations across global states in the bidirectional recursion, an explainable Bayesian recurrent neural smoother (EBRNS) is proposed for offline data-assisted fixed-interval state smoothing. At first, the proposed model, containing global states in the evolutionary interval, is transformed into an equivalent model with bidirectional memory. This transformation incorporates crucial global state information with support for bi-directional recursive computation. For the transformed model, the joint state-memory-trend Bayesian filtering and smoothing frameworks are derived by introducing the bidirectional memory iteration mechanism and offline data into Bayesian estimation theory. The derived frameworks are implemented using the Gaussian approximation to ensure analytical properties and computational efficiency. Finally, the neural network modules within EBRNS and its two-stage training scheme are designed. Unlike most existing approaches that artificially combine deep learning and model-based estimation, the bidirectional recursion and internal gated structures of EBRNS are naturally derived from Bayesian estimation theory, explainably integrating prior model knowledge, online measurement, and offline data. Experiments on representative real-world datasets demonstrate that the high smoothing accuracy of EBRNS is accompanied by data efficiency and a lightweight parameter scale.">

 Data-driven methodologies have been used in reservoir management and production forecasting, particularly demonstrating remarkable efficacy in short-term oil production forecasts. However, there is space to improve its prediction, especially in tackling the complexities of challenging reservoirs, such as the heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs from Brazilian Pre-salt fields. Methods for oil production forecasting in the petroleum literature generally consider linear correlations or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this paper, we propose a new strategy to improve short-term forecasting for oil production through attention mechanisms that boost state-of-the-art methods. Traditional data-driven techniques generally do not consider static data or planned activities. However, we address this critical gap by leveraging the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) to integrate such information into our short-term forecasting. Transformers, the architectural inspiration behind ChatGPT, employ attention mechanisms to establish relationships between different time series data points, assigning weights to these connections. We jointly explore oil, gas, and water production, pressure, and the ratios between them. This method includes static data (e.g., geographical coordinates) as well as known side reservoir information. Such side information can be, for instance, another predicted future production or planned well shut-ins. We also investigate which side information improves the obtained forecasting. This paper presents two main findings. First, it shows how using certain side information can improve the overall predictive capability of a model. For example, using predicted gas production as side information can significantly improve the oil production forecast. This is logical and in line with expectations, as there is an intimate connection between oil and gas production. In the second application of TFT, we considered well closures as the side information. We used an anomaly detection tool to identify well closures in the history period and converted it to usable side information for the TFT model. The distribution of these well closures is used as a guide to predict our target oil production. As we considered the distribution of well closures as side information, we framed our results in terms of cumulative oil production rather than daily forecast rates. The results of this work show that the cumulative production gets very close to the ground-truth data, better than linear and proposed baselines. In summary, the second key result shows and underscores the significance of incorporating side information within our TFT approach.">

        <tr id="We describe a model for a network time series whose evolution is governed by an underlying stochastic process, known as the latent position process, in which network evolution can be represented in Euclidean space by a curve, called the Euclidean mirror. We define the notion of a first-order changepoint for a time series of networks, and construct a family of latent position process networks with underlying first-order changepoints. We prove that a spectral estimate of the associated Euclidean mirror localizes these changepoints, even when the graph distribution evolves continuously, but at a rate that changes. Simulated and real data examples on organoid networks show that this localization captures empirically significant shifts in network evolution.">

        <tr id="Traffic flow prediction is considered to be one of the fundamental technologies in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) with a tremendous application prospect. Unlike traditional time series analysis tasks, the key challenge in traffic flow prediction lies in effectively modelling the highly complex and dynamic spatiotemporal dependencies within the traffic data. In recent years, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance the accuracy of traffic flow prediction, but certain issues still persist. For instance, some methods rely on specific static assumptions, failing to adequately simulate the dynamic changes in the data, thus limiting their modelling capacity. On the other hand, some approaches inadequately capture the spatiotemporal dependencies, resulting in the omission of crucial information and leading to unsatisfactory prediction outcomes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a model called the Dynamic Spatial–Temporal Self-Attention Network (DSTSAN). Firstly, this research enhances the interaction between different dimension features in the traffic data through a feature augmentation module, thereby improving the model’s representational capacity. Subsequently, the current investigation introduces two masking matrices: one captures local spatial dependencies and the other captures global spatial dependencies, based on the spatial self-attention module. Finally, the methodology employs a temporal self-attention module to capture and integrate the dynamic temporal dependencies of traffic data. We designed experiments using historical data from the previous hour to predict traffic flow conditions in the hour ahead, and the experiments were extensively compared to the DSTSAN model, with 11 baseline methods using four real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.">

        <tr id="Computational methods in biology can infer large molecular interaction networks from multiple data sources and at different resolutions, creating unprecedented opportunities to explore the mechanisms driving complex biological phenomena. Networks can be built to represent distinct conditions and compared to uncover graph-level differences—such as when comparing patterns of gene-gene interactions that change between biological states. Given the importance of the graph comparison problem, there is a clear and growing need for robust and scalable methods that can identify meaningful differences. We introduce node2vec2rank (n2v2r), a method for graph differential analysis that ranks nodes according to the disparities of their representations in joint latent embedding spaces. Improving upon previous bag-of-features approaches, we take advantage of recent advances in machine learning and statistics to compare graphs in higher-order structures and in a data-driven manner. Formulated as a multi-layer spectral embedding algorithm, n2v2r is computationally efficient, incorporates stability as a key feature, and can provably identify the correct ranking of differences between graphs in an overall procedure that adheres to veridical data science principles. By better adapting to the data, node2vec2rank clearly outperformed the commonly used node degree in finding complex differences in simulated data. In the real-world applications of breast cancer subtype characterization, analysis of cell cycle in single-cell data, and searching for sex differences in lung adenocarcinoma, node2vec2rank found meaningful biological differences enabling the hypothesis generation for therapeutic candidates. Software and analysis pipelines implementing n2v2r and used for the analyses presented here are publicly available.">

        <tr id="Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as powerful tools in various fields due to their ability to extract complex patterns from data. However, their computational requirements pose challenges, especially when deployed on resource-constrained devices such as mobile and embedded systems. Edge computing mitigates these challenges by employing various optimization techniques that help reduce latency. One such technique is Network Architecture Search (NAS), which automates the design of neural network architectures. This paper presents a methodology for predicting the inference time of TensorFlow Lite models, focusing on “Conv2d layers”. The TensorFlow Lite framework is chosen for its suitability for mobile and embedded devices, its minimal memory footprint, and its faster inference. Experiments conducted evaluate the performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and predict the inference time of Conv2d layers. The results show different error margins for different configurations, providing insight into prediction accuracy and demonstrating the applicability of this methodology for predicting the execution time of different elements of CNNs on different platforms.">
