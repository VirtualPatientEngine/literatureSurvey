        <tr id="Significance Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.">

        <tr id="Significance Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science. The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.">

        <tr id="Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.">

        <tr id="Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.">

        <tr id="Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.">

There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems (MANDy) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions.

For nonlinear systems, however, small modeling errors can lead to significant deviations from the true, measured behavior. Even in mechanical systems, where the equations are assumed to be well-known, there are often model discrepancies corresponding to nonlinear friction, wind resistance, etc. Discovering models for these discrepancies remains an open challenge for many complex systems. In this work, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to discover a model for the discrepancy between a simplified model and measurement data. In particular, we assume that the model mismatch can be sparsely represented in a library of candidate model terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several examples including experimental data from a double pendulum on a cart.

However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further modification.">

        <tr id="Researchers propose sparse regression for identifying governing partial differential equations for spatiotemporal systems. We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.">

        <tr id="Sparse model identification enables the discovery of nonlinear dynamical systems purely from data; however, this approach is sensitive to noise, especially in the low-data limit. In this work, we leverage the statistical approach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to several synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate substantial improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected from 1900 to 1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be exploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.">

Sparse regression, in particular, has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: 1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning; 2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations; and 3) the methods apply to composite regularizers, essential for total variation (TV) as well as sparsity-promoting formulations using tight frames. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, and greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. Following standards of reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.">

        <tr id="The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective technique to produce interpretable models of dynamical systems from time-resolved state data via sparse regression. However, to model parameterized systems, SINDy requires data from transient trajectories for various parameter values over the range of interest, which are typically difficult to acquire experimentally. In this work, we extend SINDy to be able to leverage data on fixed points and/or limit cycles to reduce the number of transient trajectories needed for successful system identification. To achieve this, we incorporate the data on these attractors at various parameter values as constraints in the optimization problem. First, we show that enforcing these as hard constraints leads to an ill-conditioned regression problem due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we implement soft constraints by modifying the cost function to be minimized. This leads to the formulation of a multi-objective sparse regression problem where we simultaneously seek to minimize the error of the fit to the transients trajectories and to the data on attractors, while penalizing the number of terms in the model. Our extension, demonstrated on several numerical examples, is more robust to noisy measurements and requires substantially less training data than the original SINDy method to correctly identify a parameterized dynamical system.">

        <tr id="The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

The proposed framework is structured around a two-phase process comprising data-driven model identification and state estimation. In the initial phase of model identification, conducted within a short time frame (a few seconds), we gather state feedback to elucidate the dynamics of nonlinear generators within the power grid. This is accomplished through a modified sparse regression algorithm, distinguishing it from conventional methods that rely on extensive libraries of linear and nonlinear functions. Our approach adopts an iterative strategy, commencing with a compact library and incrementally incorporating higher-order nonlinear functions based on coefficient density. Having identified the system’s dynamics, the subsequent dynamic state-estimation (DSE) phase identifies the states of the generator from limited and noisy measurements using a data-driven unscented Kalman filter approach. The effectiveness of the proposed sparse regression unscented Kalman filter is demonstrated through simulation results, validating its effectiveness for a model-free state-estimation of synchronous generators in power grid. The computational and memory efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a comparison with conventional sparse regression.">

SINDy is used to detect the system dynamics in the three well-known nonlinear systems. Analyzed are SINDy’s abilities to accurately represent transient/steady-state behaviour, noise effect, and model structure. A sparse set of basis functions can effectively capture the dynamics of a system, according to the data-driven approach known as SINDy. The coefficients of these basis functions are determined via methods of sparse regression, and the final model is made up of a number of sparse ordinary differential equations. The findings demonstrate that SINDy, with sufficient time-series data, can capture both transient and steady-state phenomena. According to the analysis of the noise effect, SINDy’s performance declines as the system’s noise level rises.

However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm. In the implementation phase, to show the effectiveness of GN-SINDy, we compare its results with DeePyMoD by using a Python package that is prepared for this purpose on numerous PDE discovery">

        <tr id="In order to extract governing equations from time-series data, various approaches are proposed. Among those, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) stands out as a successful method capable of modeling governing equations with a minimal number of terms, utilizing the principles of compressive sensing. This feature, which relies on a small number of terms, is crucial for interpretability. The effectiveness of SINDy hinges on the choice of candidate functions within its dictionary to extract governing equations of dynamical systems. A larger dictionary allows for more terms, enhancing the quality of approximations. However, the computational complexity scales with dictionary size, rendering SINDy less suitable for high-dimensional datasets, even though it has been successfully applied to low-dimensional datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce iterative SINDy in this paper, where the dictionary undergoes expansion and compression through iterations. We also conduct an analysis of the convergence properties of iterative SINDy. Simulation results validate that iterative SINDy can achieve nearly identical performance to SINDy, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Notably, iterative SINDy demonstrates effectiveness with high-dimensional time-series data without incurring the prohibitively high computational cost associated with SINDy.">

Since formulating governing expressions from first principles can be difficult, it is of particular interest to identify expressions for iterated maps given only their data streams. In this work, we consider a modified Symbolic Artificial Neural Network-Trained Expressions (SymANNTEx) architecture for this task, an architecture more expressive than others in the literature. We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented. We show that our modified SymANNTEx model properly identifies single-state maps and achieves moderate success in approximating a dual-state attractor.

Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming.

        <tr id="The parametric greedy latent space dynamics identification (gLaSDI) framework has demonstrated promising potential for accurate and efficient modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear physical systems. However, it remains challenging to handle noisy data. To enhance robustness against noise, we incorporate the weak-form estimation of nonlinear dynamics (WENDy) into gLaSDI. In the proposed weak-form gLaSDI (WgLaSDI) framework, an autoencoder and WENDy are trained simultaneously to discover intrinsic nonlinear latent-space dynamics of high-dimensional data. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) employed in gLaSDI, WENDy enables variance reduction and robust latent space discovery, therefore leading to more accurate and efficient reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, the greedy physics-informed active learning in WgLaSDI enables adaptive sampling of optimal training data on the fly for enhanced modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various nonlinear dynamical problems, including viscous and inviscid Burgers' equations, time-dependent radial advection, and the Vlasov equation for plasma physics. With data that contains 5-10% Gaussian white noise, WgLaSDI outperforms gLaSDI by orders of magnitude, achieving 1-7% relative errors. Compared with the high-fidelity models, WgLaSDI achieves 121 to 1,779x speed-up.">

In the space of delayed observations of this motion, we reconstruct a low-dimensional attracting spectral submanifold (SSM) whose internal dynamics serves as a mathematically justified reduced-order model for nearby motions of the full system. We obtain this model in a simple polynomial form that allows explicit identification of important physical system parameters, such as natural frequencies, linear and nonlinear damping and nonlinear stiffness. Beyond faithfully reproducing attracting steady states and limit cycles, our SSM-reduced models can also uncover hidden motion not seen in the video, such as unstable fixed points and unstable limit cycles forming basin boundaries. We demonstrate all these features on experimental videos of five physical systems: a double pendulum, an inverted flag in counter-flow, water sloshing in tank, a wing exhibiting aeroelastic flutter and a shimmying wheel.">

        <tr id="The discovery of linear embedding is the key to the synthesis of linear control techniques for nonlinear systems. In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.">

This paper introduces a novel, data-driven framework that synergizes physics-based priors with advanced ML techniques to address the computational and practical limitations inherent in first-principle-based methods and brute-force machine learning methods. Our framework showcases four algorithms, each embedding a specific physics-based prior tailored to a particular class of nonlinear systems, including separable and nonseparable Hamiltonian systems, hyperbolic partial differential equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics. The intrinsic incorporation of physical laws preserves the system's intrinsic symmetries and conservation laws, ensuring solutions are physically plausible and computationally efficient. The integration of these priors also enhances the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns typical in physical phenomena that conventional methods often miss. As a result, our models outperform existing data-driven techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, and predictive capability, particularly in recognizing features absent from the training set, despite relying on small datasets, short training periods, and small sample sizes.">

The computational efficiency of such surrogate models is especially important for design, exhaustive exploration and physical understanding. Plasma simulations, in particular those applied to the study of ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ plasma discharges and technologies, such as Hall thrusters, require substantial computational resources in order to resolve the multidimentional dynamics that span across wide spatial and temporal scales. Although high-fidelity computational tools are available to simulate such systems over limited conditions and in highly simplified geometries, simulations of full-size systems and/or extensive parametric studies over many geometric configurations and under different physical conditions are computationally intractable with conventional numerical tools. Thus, scientific studies and industrially oriented modeling of plasma systems, including the important ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ technologies, stand to significantly benefit from reduced order modeling algorithms. We develop a model reduction scheme based upon a {\em Shallow REcurrent Decoder} (SHRED) architecture. The scheme uses a neural network for encoding limited sensor measurements in time (sequence-to-sequence encoding) to full state-space reconstructions via a decoder network. Based upon the theory of separation of variables, the SHRED architecture is capable of (i) reconstructing full spatio-temporal fields with as little as three point sensors, even the fields that are not measured with sensor feeds but that are in dynamic coupling with the measured field, and (ii) forecasting the future state of the system using neural network roll-outs from the trained time encoding model.">

However, in applications involving wider operating conditions, representation of the dynamics using a single linear dynamic model is often inadequate, requiring either a nonlinear model or multiple linear models to accommodate the nonlinear behaviour. While the development of the former suffers from the requirements of extensive experiments spanning multiple levels, significant compromise in the nominal product quality and dealing with unmeasured disturbances over wider operating conditions, the latter faces the challenge of model switch scheduling and inadequate description of dynamics for the operating regions in-between.

However, it is often very difficult to identify the system's governing equations, especially in complex environments that combine physical laws of different disciplines. In this paper, we present a new approach that allows identifying an ordinary differential equation by means of a physics-informed machine learning algorithm. Our method introduces a special neural network that allows exploiting prior human knowledge to a certain degree and extends it autonomously, so that the resulting differential equations describe the system as accurately as possible. We validate the method on a Duffing oscillator with simulation data and, additionally, on a cascaded tank example with real-world data. Subsequently, we use the developed algorithm in a model-based reinforcement learning framework by alternately identifying and controlling a system to a target state.

        <tr id="Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems often faces numerous data-related challenges. A fundamental requirement is the existence of a unique set of parameters for a chosen model structure, an issue commonly referred to as identifiability. Although this problem is well studied for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), few studies have focused on the more general class of systems described by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Examples of DAEs include dynamical systems with algebraic equations representing conservation laws or approximating fast dynamics. This work introduces a novel identifiability test for models characterized by nonlinear DAEs. Unlike previous approaches, our test only requires prior knowledge of the system equations and does not need nonlinear transformation, index reduction, or numerical integration of the DAEs. We employed our identifiability analysis across a diverse range of DAE models, illustrating how system identifiability depends on the choices of sensors, experimental conditions, and model structures. Given the added challenges involved in identifying DAEs when compared to ODEs, we anticipate that our findings will have broad applicability and contribute significantly to the development and validation of data-driven methods for DAEs and other structure-preserving models.">

        <tr id="Linearity of Koopman operators and simplicity of their estimators coupled with model-reduction capabilities has lead to their great popularity in applications for learning dynamical systems. While nonparametric Koopman operator learning in infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is well understood for autonomous systems, its control system analogues are largely unexplored. Addressing systems with control inputs in a principled manner is crucial for fully data-driven learning of controllers, especially since existing approaches commonly resort to representational heuristics or parametric models of limited expressiveness and scalability. We address the aforementioned challenge by proposing a universal framework via control-affine reproducing kernels that enables direct estimation of a single operator even for control systems. The proposed approach, called control-Koopman operator regression (cKOR), is thus completely analogous to Koopman operator regression of the autonomous case. First in the literature, we present a nonparametric framework for learning Koopman operator representations of nonlinear control-affine systems that does not suffer from the curse of control input dimensionality. This allows for reformulating the infinite-dimensional learning problem in a finite-dimensional space based solely on data without apriori loss of precision due to a restriction to a finite span of functions or inputs as in other approaches. For enabling applications to large-scale control systems, we also enhance the scalability of control-Koopman operator estimators by leveraging random projections (sketching). The efficacy of our novel cKOR approach is demonstrated on both forecasting and control tasks.">

Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

        <tr id="Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.">

The machine learning model overcomes the inherent limitations in traditional long short-time memory networks by exploiting a conditional Gaussian structure informed of the essential physical dynamics. The model performance is demonstrated under a prototype model from idealized geophysical flow and passive tracers, which exhibits analytical solutions with representative statistical features. Many attractive properties are found in the trained model in recovering the hidden dynamics using a limited dataset and sparse observation time, showing uniformly high skill with persistent numerical stability in predicting both the trajectory and statistical solutions among different statistical regimes away from the training regime.

        <tr id="Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.">

        <tr id="When neural networks are trained from data to simulate the dynamics of physical systems, they encounter a persistent challenge: the long-time dynamics they produce are often unphysical or unstable. We analyze the origin of such instabilities when learning linear dynamical systems, focusing on the training dynamics. We make several analytical findings which empirical observations suggest extend to nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.">

To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

The novelty of this approach is that it can control a system's dynamics despite the controller being much slower than the dynamics. We demonstrate this controller on the Lorenz system of equations where it iteratively adjusts (tunes) the system's input parameters to successfully reproduce a desired oscillatory trajectory or state. Additionally, we investigate the system's dynamical sensitivity to its control parameters, identify continuous and bounded regions of desired dynamical trajectories, and demonstrate that the controller is robust to missing information and uncontrollable parameters as long as certain requirements are met.

We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data. Our approach shows potential for applications in fields such as neuroscience, material science, and weather prediction, where slow dynamics influencing qualitative changes are often unobservable.">

        <tr id="Reduced order modeling lowers the computational cost of solving PDEs by learning a low-order spatial representation from data and dynamically evolving these representations using manifold projections of the governing equations. While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.">

        <tr id="Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.">

        <tr id="One of the central goals of neuroscience is to gain a mechanistic understanding of how the dynamics of neural circuits give rise to their observed function. A popular approach towards this end is to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to reproduce experimental recordings of neural activity. These trained RNNs are then treated as surrogate models of biological neural circuits, whose properties can be dissected via dynamical systems analysis. How reliable are the mechanistic insights derived from this procedure? While recent advances in population-level recording technologies have allowed simultaneous recording of up to tens of thousands of neurons, this represents only a tiny fraction of most cortical circuits. Here we show that observing only a subset of neurons in a circuit can create mechanistic mismatches between a simulated teacher network and a data-constrained student, even when the two networks have matching single-unit dynamics. In particular, partial observation of models of low-dimensional cortical dynamics based on functionally feedforward or low-rank connectivity can lead to surrogate models with spurious attractor structure. Our results illustrate the challenges inherent in accurately uncovering neural mechanisms from single-trial data, and suggest the need for new methods of validating data-constrained models for neural dynamics.">

This paper employs a greedy sampling approach based on the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method to identify the most informative samples in a dataset associated with a partial differential equation to estimate its parameters. Greedy samples are used to train a physics-informed neural network architecture which maps the nonlinear relation between spatio-temporal data and the measured values. To prove the impact of greedy samples on the training of the physics-informed neural network for parameter estimation of a partial differential equation, their performance is compared with random samples taken from the given dataset. Our simulation results show that for all considered partial differential equations, greedy samples outperform random samples, i.e., we can estimate parameters with a significantly lower number of samples while simultaneously reducing the relative estimation error. A Python package is also prepared to support different phases of the proposed algorithm, including data prepossessing, greedy sampling, neural network training, and comparison.">

Our basic assumption is that the governing equations for the stochastic system are unavailable. However, short bursts of input/output (I/O) data consisting of certain known excitation signals and their corresponding system responses are available. When a sufficient amount of such I/O data are available, our method is capable of learning the unknown dynamics and producing an accurate predictive model for the stochastic responses of the system subject to arbitrary excitation signals not in the training data. Our method has two key components: (1) a local approximation of the training I/O data to transfer the learning into a parameterized form; and (2) a generative model to approximate the underlying unknown stochastic flow map in distribution. After presenting the method in detail, we present a comprehensive set of numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, especially for long-term system predictions.">

        <tr id="Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, more data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalizable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than the neural network alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularization, penalizing biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularization not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularization reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses. Author summary Systems biology concerns the modelling and analysis of biological processes, by viewing these as interconnected systems. Modelling is typically done either using mechanistic differential equations that are derived from experiments and known biology, or using machine learning on large biological datasets. While mathematical modelling from biological experiments can provide useful insights with limited data, building and validating these models takes a long time and often requires highly invasive measurements in humans. Efforts to combine this classical technique with machine learning have resulted in a framework termed universal differential equations, where the model equations contain a neural network to describe unknown biological interactions. While these methods have shown success in numerous fields, applications in biology are more challenging due to limited data-availability, high data sparsity. In this work, we have introduced physiology-informed regularization to overcome these instabilities and to constrain the model to biologically plausible behavior. Our results show that by using physiology-informed regularization, we can accurately predict future unseen observations in a simulated example, with much more limited data than a similar model without regularization. Additionally, we show an application of this technique on human data, applying a neural network to learn the appearance of glucose in the blood plasma after a meal.">

Each reduced order model is composed of a nonlinear encoder-regressor-decoder architecture and is equipped with an adaptive update strategy that adds robustness for extrapolation. In doing so, the proposed methodology leverages physics-based insights from high-fidelity solvers, thus establishing a physics-aware machine learning predictor. Using three strongly coupled FSI examples, this study demonstrates the improved convergence obtained with the new predictor and the overall computational speedup realized compared to classical approaches.">

To decipher their physical laws, we need to bridge between experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Thanks to progress in microscopy and tracking, there is today an abundance of experimental trajectories reflecting these dynamical laws. Inferring physical models from noisy and imperfect experimental data, however, is challenging. Because there are no inference methods that are robust and efficient, model reconstruction from experimental trajectories is a bottleneck to data-driven biophysics. In this Thesis, I present a set of tools developed to bridge this gap and permit robust and universal inference of stochastic dynamical models from experimental trajectories. These methods are rooted in an information-theoretical framework that quantifies how much can be inferred from trajectories that are short, partial and noisy. They permit the efficient inference of dynamical models for overdamped and underdamped Langevin systems, as well as the inference of entropy production rates. I finally present early applications of these techniques, as well as future research directions.">

This translation process leverages recent advances in data-driven control theory, enabling the controller to operate effectively without relying on explicit system models. The proposed framework incorporates a robust methodology for managing system constraints, ensuring that the control actions remain within predefined bounds. By means of time sequences, the controller learns the underlying system dynamics and adapts to changes in real time, providing enhanced performance and reliability. The integration of set-theoretic methods allows for the systematic handling of uncertainties and disturbances, which are common when the trajectory of a nonlinear system is embedded inside a linear trajectory state tube. To validate the effectiveness of our DDMPC framework, we conduct extensive simulations on a nonlinear DC motor system.

The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction.

In this work, we introduce a deep learning approach where the physical system is modeled as a sequence of coarse-to-fine Gaussian prior distributions parametrized by a neural network.

Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in aerial robotics have enabled the use of multirotor vehicles for autonomous payload transportation. Resorting only to classical methods to reliably model a quadrotor carrying a cable-slung load poses significant challenges. On the other hand, purely data-driven learning methods do not comply by design with the problem's physical constraints, especially in states that are not densely represented in training data. In this work, we explore the use of physics informed neural networks to learn an end-to-end model of the multirotor-slung-load system and, at a given time, estimate a sequence of the future system states. An LSTM encoder decoder with an attention mechanism is used to capture the dynamics of the system. To guarantee the cohesiveness between the multiple predicted states of the system, we propose the use of a physics-based term in the loss function, which includes a discretized physical model derived from first principles together with slack variables that allow for a small mismatch between expected and predicted values. To train the model, a dataset using a real-world quadrotor carrying a slung load was curated and is made available. Prediction results are presented and corroborate the feasibility of the approach. The proposed method outperforms both the first principles physical model and a comparable neural network model trained without the physics regularization proposed.">

However, they often rely on strong modeling assumptions and expensive numerical integration, requiring significant computational resources and domain expertise. While deep learning (DL) provides efficient alternatives for modeling complex dynamics, they require a large amount of labeled training data. Furthermore, its predictions may disobey the governing physical laws and are difficult to interpret. Physics-guided DL aims to integrate first-principled physical knowledge into data-driven methods. It has the best of both worlds and is well equipped to better solve scientific problems. Recently, this field has gained great progress and has drawn considerable interest across discipline Here, we introduce the framework of physics-guided DL with a special emphasis on learning dynamical systems. We describe the learning pipeline and categorize state-of-the-art methods under this framework. We also offer our perspectives on the open challenges and emerging opportunities.">

        <tr id="Advancements in machine learning and an abundance of structural monitoring data have inspired the integration of mechanical models with probabilistic models to identify a structure's state and quantify the uncertainty of its physical parameters and response. In this paper, we propose an inference methodology for classical Kirchhoff-Love plates via physics-informed Gaussian Processes (GP). A probabilistic model is formulated as a multi-output GP by placing a GP prior on the deflection and deriving the covariance function using the linear differential operators of the plate governing equations. The posteriors of the flexural rigidity, hyperparameters, and plate response are inferred in a Bayesian manner using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from noisy measurements. We demonstrate the applicability with two examples: a simply supported plate subjected to a sinusoidal load and a fixed plate subjected to a uniform load. The results illustrate how the proposed methodology can be employed to perform stochastic inference for plate rigidity and physical quantities by integrating measurements from various sensor types and qualities. Potential applications of the presented methodology are in structural health monitoring and uncertainty quantification of plate-like structures.">

However, most progress has focused on proving identifiability results in different settings, and we are not aware of any successful real-world application. At the same time, the field of dynamical systems benefited from deep learning and scaled to countless applications but does not allow parameter identification. In this paper, we draw a clear connection between the two and their key assumptions, allowing us to apply identifiable methods developed in causal representation learning to dynamical systems. At the same time, we can leverage scalable differentiable solvers developed for differential equations to build models that are both identifiable and practical. Overall, we learn explicitly controllable models that isolate the trajectory-specific parameters for further downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution classification or treatment effect estimation. We experiment with a wind simulator with partially known factors of variation. We also apply the resulting model to real-world climate data and successfully answer downstream causal questions in line with existing literature on climate change.">

        <tr id="The effective inclusion of a priori knowledge when embedding known data in physics‐based models of dynamical systems can ensure that the reconstructed model respects physical principles, while simultaneously improving the accuracy of the solution in the previously unseen regions of state space. This paper presents a physics‐constrained data‐driven discrepancy modeling method that variationally embeds known data in the modeling framework. The hierarchical structure of the method yields fine scale variational equations that facilitate the derivation of residuals which are comprised of the first‐principles theory and sensor‐based data from the dynamical system. The embedding of the sensor data via residual terms leads to discrepancy‐informed closure models that yield a method which is driven not only by boundary and initial conditions, but also by measurements that are taken at only a few observation points in the target system. Specifically, the data‐embedding term serves as residual‐based least‐squares loss function, thus retaining variational consistency. Another important relation arises from the interpretation of the stabilization tensor as a kernel function, thereby incorporating a priori knowledge of the problem and adding computational intelligence to the modeling framework. Numerical test cases show that when known data is taken into account, the data driven variational (DDV) method can correctly predict the system response in the presence of several types of discrepancies. Specifically, the damped solution and correct energy time histories are recovered by including known data in the undamped situation. Morlet wavelet analyses reveal that the surrogate problem with embedded data recovers the fundamental frequency band of the target system. The enhanced stability and accuracy of the DDV method is manifested via reconstructed displacement and velocity fields that yield time histories of strain and kinetic energies which match the target systems. The proposed DDV method also serves as a procedure for restoring eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a deficient dynamical system when known data is taken into account, as shown in the numerical test cases presented here.">

        <tr id="For mathematical and experimental ease, models with time varying parameters are often simplified to assume constant parameters. However, this simplification can potentially lead to identifiability issues (lack of uniqueness of parameter estimates). Methods have been developed to algebraically and numerically determine the identifiability of a model, as well as resolve identifiability issues. This specific type of simplification presents an alternate opportunity to instead use this information to resolve the unidentifiability. Given that re-parameterizing, collecting more data, and adding inputs can be potentially costly or impractical, this could present new alternatives. We present a method for resolving unidentifiability in a system by introducing a new data stream correlated with a parameter of interest. First, we demonstrate how and when non-constant input data can be introduced into any rational function ODE system without worsening the model identifiability. Then, we prove when these input functions improve structural and potentially also practical identifiability for a given model and relevant data. By utilizing pre-existing data streams, these methods can potentially reduce experimental costs, while still answering key questions. By connecting mathematical proofs to application, our framework removes guesswork from when, where, and how researchers can best introduce new data to improve model outcomes.">

        <tr id="The precise simulation of turbulent flows is of immense importance in a variety of scientific and engineering fields, including climate science, freshwater science, and the development of energy-efficient manufacturing processes. Within the realm of turbulent flow simulation, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is widely considered to be the most reliable approach, but it is prohibitively expensive for long-term simulation at fine spatial scales. Given the pressing need for efficient simulation, there is an increasing interest in building machine learning models for turbulence, either by reconstructing DNS from alternative low-fidelity simulations or by predicting DNS based on the patterns learned from historical data. However, standard machine learning techniques remain limited in capturing complex spatio-temporal characteristics of turbulent flows, resulting in limited performance and generalizability. This paper presents a novel physics-enhanced neural operator (PENO) that incorporates physical knowledge of partial differential equations (PDEs) to accurately model flow dynamics. The model is further refined by a self-augmentation mechanism to reduce the accumulated error in long-term simulations. The proposed method is evaluated through its performance on two distinct sets of 3D turbulent flow data, showcasing the model's capability to reconstruct high-resolution DNS data, maintain the inherent physical properties of flow transport, and generate flow simulations across various resolutions. Additionally, experimental results on multiple 2D vorticity flow series, generated by different PDEs, highlight the transferability and generalizability of the proposed method. This confirms its applicability to a wide range of real-world scenarios in which extensive simulations are needed under diverse settings.">

Coupling pHS via linear relations between input and output defines an overall pHS, which is structure preserving. However, in multiphysics applications, some subsystems do not allow for a physical pHS description, as (a) this is not available or (b) too expensive. Here, data-driven approaches can be used to deliver a pHS for such subsystems, which can then be coupled to the other subsystems in a structure-preserving way. In this work, we derive a data-driven identification approach for port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The approach uses input and state space data to estimate nonlinear effort functions of pH-DAEs. As underlying technique, we us (multi-task) Gaussian processes. This work thereby extends over the current state of the art, in which only port-Hamiltonian ordinary differential equation systems could be identified via Gaussian processes. We apply this approach successfully to two applications from network design and constrained multibody system dynamics, based on pH-DAE system of index one and three, respectively.">

Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed trial-to-trial variability.">

To achieve this, we provide two tractable semi-definite programs. These programs allow obtaining optimal uncertainty model parameters for both locally and globally Lipschitz nonlinear models, given uncertainty and state trajectories. Subsequently, in order to extract this data from the available input-output trajectories, we introduce a filter that incorporates an approximated internal model of the uncertainty and asymptotically estimates uncertainty and state realizations. This filter is also synthesized using semi-definite programs with guaranteed robustness with respect to uncertainty model mismatches, disturbances, and noise. Numerical simulations for a large data-set of a roll plane model of a vehicle illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed methodology in improving model accuracy, while guaranteeing stability.">

Unit consistency constraints are applied to the symbolic expressions to ensure physical realizability. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to the separated flow over 2D periodic hills. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy and generalization capabilities of the learned turbulence model. Compared to the standard k-{\epsilon} model, the learned model exhibits significantly enhanced predictive accuracy for anisotropic Reynolds stresses and flow velocities. It also more accurately identifies flow separations and exhibits promising generalization capabilities across different flow geometries.">

This work introduces the Universal Fractional Integro-Differential Equation Solvers (UniFIDES), a comprehensive machine learning platform designed to expeditiously solve a variety of FIDEs in both forward and inverse directions, without the need for ad hoc manipulation of the equations. The effectiveness of UniFIDES is demonstrated through a collection of integer-order and fractional problems in science and engineering. Our results highlight UniFIDES' ability to accurately solve a wide spectrum of integro-differential equations and offer the prospect of using machine learning platforms universally for discovering and describing dynamical and complex systems.">

        <tr id="We developed a novel reservoir characterization workflow that addresses reservoir history matching by coupling a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) forward model with a mixture of experts' approach, termed cluster classify regress (CCR). The inverse modelling is achieved via an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman inversion (aREKI) method, ideal for rapid inverse uncertainty quantification during history matching. We parametrize unknown permeability and porosity fields for non-Gaussian posterior measures using a variational convolution autoencoder and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) exotic priors. The CCR works as a supervised model with the PINO surrogate to replicate nonlinear Peaceman well equations. The CCR's flexibility allows any independent machine-learning algorithm for each stage. The PINO reservoir surrogate's loss function is derived from supervised data loss and losses from the initial conditions and residual of the governing black oil PDE. The PINO-CCR surrogate outputs pressure, water, and gas saturations, along with oil, water, and gas production rates. The methodology was compared to a standard numerical black oil simulator for a waterflooding case on the Norne field, showing similar outputs. This PINO-CCR surrogate was then used in the aREKI history matching workflow, successfully recovering the unknown permeability, porosity and fault multiplier, with simulations up to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. Training the PINO-CCR surrogate on an NVIDIA H100 with 80G memory takes about 5 hours for 100 samples of the Norne field. This workflow is suitable for ensemble-based approaches, where posterior density sampling, given an expensive likelihood evaluation, is desirable for uncertainty quantification.">

        <tr id="Finding self-similarity is a key step for understanding the governing law behind complex physical phenomena. Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

        <tr id="In chemical engineering, process data is often expensive to acquire, and complex phenomena are difficult to model rigorously, rendering both entirely data-driven and purely mechanistic modeling approaches impractical. We explore using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling dynamic processes governed by differential-algebraic equation systems when process data is scarce and complete mechanistic knowledge is missing. In particular, we focus on estimating states for which neither direct observational data nor constitutive equations are available. For demonstration purposes, we study a continuously stirred tank reactor and a liquid-liquid separator. We find that PINNs can infer unmeasured states with reasonable accuracy, and they generalize better in low-data scenarios than purely data-driven models. We thus show that PINNs, similar to hybrid mechanistic/data-driven models, are capable of modeling processes when relatively few experimental data and only partially known mechanistic descriptions are available, and conclude that they constitute a promising avenue that warrants further investigation.">

        <tr id="Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a new online Design of Experiments methodology for identifying dynamical nonlinear systems. The approach is based on an evolving neuro-fuzzy identification framework that uses the confidence interval of fuzzy rules to measure model convergence. Informative data are crucial for system identification, particularly in the context of nonlinear dynamical processes. When control over the input signals is possible, a tailored experiment can be designed to minimize experiment duration and resource consumption. In contrast to traditional Design of Experiments approaches, which are iterative, our proposed method selects the inputs online at each time step, while identifying the model. We have investigated the use of the Confidence Interval in unsupervised clustering, parameter identification, and Design of Experiments. The performance of the method is compared to related evolving systems on the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a Piecewise Linear dynamical system with outliers and a real Plate Heat Exchanger pilot plant. The outlying data were successfully rejected online by the proposed methodology, while the real-world experiments detected the initial cold start behaviors and excluded them from the final model. The methodology shows robust Design of Experiments and outlier rejection capabilities, making it a promising approach for identifying dynamical nonlinear systems in a noisy environment.">

We demonstrate through numerical results that, relying on the derived algorithm to identify the inertia tensor of a nanosatellite, we can achieve improved estimation accuracy and robustness, by integrating physical constraints and leveraging partial knowledge of the system dynamics. In particular, we show how it is possible to enhance the convergence of the physics-based algorithm to the true values by either overparametrization or introducing a black-box term that captures the unmodelled dynamics related to the off-diagonal components.">

        <tr id="This paper considers the data-driven stabilization of linear boundary controlled parabolic PDEs by making use of the Koopman operator. For this, a Koopman eigenstructure assignment problem is solved, which amounts to determine a feedback of the Koopman open-loop eigenfunctionals assigning a desired finite set of closed-loop Koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctionals to the closed-loop system. It is shown that the designed controller only needs a finite number of open-loop Koopman eigenvalues and modes of the state. They are determined by extending the classical Krylov-DMD to parabolic systems. For this, only a finite number of pointlike outputs and their temporal samples as well as temporal samples of the inputs are required resulting in a data-driven solution of the eigenstructure assignment problem. Exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of small Krylov-DMD errors is verified. An unstable diffusion-reaction system demonstrates the new data-driven controller design technique for distributed-parameter systems.">

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

        <tr id="Parameter estimation is one of the central problems in computational modeling of biological systems. Typically, scientists must fully specify the mathematical structure of the model, often expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations, to estimate the parameters. This process poses significant challenges due to the necessity for a detailed understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating model parameters and assessing their identifiability in situations where only partial knowledge of the system structure is available. The partially known model is extended into a system of Hybrid Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, which captures the unknown portions of the system using neural networks. Integrating neural networks into the model structure introduces two primary challenges for parameter estimation: the need to globally explore the search space while employing gradient-based optimization, and the assessment of parameter identifiability, which may be hindered by the expressive nature of neural networks. To overcome the first issue, we treat biological parameters as hyperparameters in the extended model, exploring the parameter search space during hyperparameter tuning. The second issue is then addressed by an a posteriori analysis of parameter identifiability, computed by introducing a variant of a well-established approach for mechanistic models. These two components are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that is thoroughly described in the paper. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on test cases derived from three different benchmark models. These test cases have been designed to mimic real-world conditions, including the presence of noise in the training data and various levels of data availability for the system variables. Author summary Parameter estimation is a central challenge in modeling biological systems. Typically, scientists calibrate the parameters by aligning model predictions with measured data once the model structure is defined. Our paper introduces a workflow that leverages the integration between mechanistic modeling and machine learning to estimate model parameters when the model structure is not fully known. We focus mainly on analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters, which measures how confident we can be in the parameter estimates given the available experimental data and partial mechanistic understanding of the system. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach in various in silico scenarios. Our workflow represents a first step to adapting traditional methods used in fully mechanistic models to the scenario of hybrid modeling.">

        <tr id="Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

        <tr id="There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.">

However, currently available neural network-based modeling approaches fall short when faced with data collected randomly over time and space, as is often the case with sensor networks in real-world applications like crowdsourced earthquake detection or pollution monitoring. In response, we developed a new spatiotemporal method that effectively handles such randomly sampled data. Our model integrates techniques from amortized variational inference, neural differential equations, neural point processes, and implicit neural representations to predict both the dynamics of the system and the probabilistic locations and timings of future observations. It outperforms existing methods on challenging spatiotemporal datasets by offering substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a useful tool for modeling and understanding complex dynamical systems observed under realistic, unconstrained conditions.">

 Deterministic Neural Networks (NNs) have been widely adopted to represent system behaviors in various engineering problems, which have been criticized for providing overconfident predictions. This challenge, i.e., overfitting, refers to a model that captures data patterns and random noise during the learning process, leading to an inferior predictive capability in the unobserved domains. As known to all, Bayesian inference offers an effective way for uncertainty quantification (UQ) to help enhance model predictions and offer informed decision-making. Integrating deterministic NN models with Bayesian inference provides a way to fast simulate and quantify both data and model uncertainty simultaneously. Thereby, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), a combination of standard NNs with Bayesian philosophy, introduce probability to the network parameters, i.e., biases and weights. In BNNs, predictive uncertainty reflects how confident model predictions are regarding the corresponding credible intervals, which helps identify overfitting and interpreting abnormal predictions. Another advantage is that BNNs naturally implement regularization by integrating over the weights such that BNNs can reach good generalization when data availability is limited. BNNs rely heavily on observations as a purely data-driven approach. Besides, standard BNNs have relatively complex network structures, which makes it hard to provide detailed interpretability on model predictions. Researchers share concerns about their predictions that may violate real-world phenomena. The combination of physics knowledge with the optimization objective can improve the adherence of predictions with the known physical principles. Physics laws are usually embedded as constraint functions in the process of optimization. With the help of constrained optimization, model predictions keep consistent with the known physical principles.
 The authors refine BNNs with physics-guided information, i.e., Physics-Guided BNNs (PG-BNNs), to reduce dependence on data, improve model interpretability, and offer reliable model predictions. PG-BNNs interpret the known physics knowledge as constraint functions to better guide optimization processes, especially for case studies with sparse and limited data sets. A case study of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) problem is carried out to compare the performance of PG-BNN and unconstrained BNN models and demonstrate the effectiveness of PG-BNN.">

        <tr id="Single-cell time series data frequently display considerable variability across a cell population. The current gold standard for inferring parameter distributions across cell populations is the Global Two Stage (GTS) approach for nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models. However, this method is computationally intensive, as it makes repeated use of non-convex optimization that in turn requires numerical integration of the underlying system. Here, we propose the Gradient Matching GTS (GMGTS) method as an efficient alternative to GTS. Gradient matching offers an integration-free approach to parameter estimation that is particularly powerful for dynamical systems that are linear in the unknown parameters, such as biochemical networks modeled by mass action kinetics. Here, we harness the power of gradient matching by integrating it into the GTS framework. To this end, we significantly expand the capabilities of gradient matching via uncertainty propagation calculations and the development of an iterative estimation scheme for partially observed systems. Through comparisons of GMGTS with GTS in different inference setups, we demonstrate that our method provides a significant computational advantage, thereby facilitating the use of complex NLME models in systems biology applications.">

        <tr id="Traditional low-rank approximation is a powerful tool to compress the huge data matrices that arise in simulations of partial differential equations (PDE), but suffers from high computational cost and requires several passes over the PDE data. The compressed data may also lack interpretability thus making it difficult to identify feature patterns from the original data. To address this issue, we present an online randomized algorithm to compute the interpolative decomposition (ID) of large-scale data matrices in situ. Compared to previous randomized IDs that used the QR decomposition to determine the column basis, we adopt a streaming ridge leverage score-based column subset selection algorithm that dynamically selects proper basis columns from the data and thus avoids an extra pass over the data to compute the coefficient matrix of the ID. In particular, we adopt a single-pass error estimator based on the non-adaptive Hutch++ algorithm to provide real-time error approximation for determining the best coefficients. As a result, our approach only needs a single pass over the original data and thus is suitable for large and high-dimensional matrices stored outside of core memory or generated in PDE simulations. We also provide numerical experiments on turbulent channel flow and ignition simulations, and on the NSTX Gas Puff Image dataset, comparing our algorithm with the offline ID algorithm to demonstrate its utility in real-world applications.">

This work describes a data-driven technique to create high-fidelity low-dimensional models of flexible fiber dynamics using machine learning; the technique is applied to sedimentation in a quiescent, viscous Newtonian fluid, using results from detailed simulations as the data set. The approach combines an autoencoder neural network architecture to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the filament shape, with a neural ODE that learns the evolution of the particle in the latent state. The model was designed to model filaments of varying flexibility, characterized by an elasto-gravitational number $\mathcal{B}$, and was trained on a data set containing the evolution of fibers beginning at set angles of inclination. For the range of $\mathcal{B}$ considered here (100-10000), the filament shape dynamics can be represented with high accuracy with only four degrees of freedom, in contrast to the 93 present in the original bead-spring model used to generate the dynamic trajectories. We predict the evolution of fibers set at arbitrary angles and demonstrate that our data-driven model can accurately forecast the evolution of a fiber at both trained and untrained elasto-gravitational numbers.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

        <tr id="The coupling of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and deep learning-based ROMs (DL-ROMs) has proved to be a successful strategy to construct non-intrusive, highly accurate, surrogates for the real time solution of parametric nonlinear time-dependent PDEs. Inexpensive to evaluate, POD-DL-ROMs are also relatively fast to train, thanks to their limited complexity. However, POD-DL-ROMs account for the physical laws governing the problem at hand only through the training data, that are usually obtained through a full order model (FOM) relying on a high-fidelity discretization of the underlying equations. Moreover, the accuracy of POD-DL-ROMs strongly depends on the amount of available data. In this paper, we consider a major extension of POD-DL-ROMs by enforcing the fulfillment of the governing physical laws in the training process -- that is, by making them physics-informed -- to compensate for possible scarce and/or unavailable data and improve the overall reliability. To do that, we first complement POD-DL-ROMs with a trunk net architecture, endowing them with the ability to compute the problem's solution at every point in the spatial domain, and ultimately enabling a seamless computation of the physics-based loss by means of the strong continuous formulation. Then, we introduce an efficient training strategy that limits the notorious computational burden entailed by a physics-informed training phase. In particular, we take advantage of the few available data to develop a low-cost pre-training procedure; then, we fine-tune the architecture in order to further improve the prediction reliability. Accuracy and efficiency of the resulting pre-trained physics-informed DL-ROMs (PTPI-DL-ROMs) are then assessed on a set of test cases ranging from non-affinely parametrized advection-diffusion-reaction equations, to nonlinear problems like the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flows.">

While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

Theoretically, we prove the universal approximation capability of CoNO. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of CoNO on seven challenging partial differential equations (PDEs), including regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds. Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data. Altogether, CoNO presents a robust and superior model for modeling continuous dynamical systems, providing a fillip to scientific machine learning.">

However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest.

Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information.

Linear statistical methods such as the principal component analysis and its variants are widely used across various fields of applied science to identify and rank these components based on the variance they represent in the data. These methods can be seen as factorizations of the matrix collecting all the data, which are assumed to be a collection of time series sampled from fixed points in space. However, when data sampling locations vary over time, as with mobile monitoring stations in meteorology and oceanography or with particle tracking velocimetry in experimental fluid dynamics, advanced interpolation techniques are required to project the data onto a fixed grid before carrying out the factorization. This interpolation is often expensive and inaccurate. This work proposes a method to decompose scattered data without interpolating. The approach is based on physics-constrained radial basis function regression to compute inner products in space and time. The method provides an analytical and mesh-independent decomposition in space and time, demonstrating higher accuracy than the traditional approach. Our results show that it is possible to distill the most relevant"components"even for measurements whose natural output is a distribution of data scattered in space and time, maintaining high accuracy and mesh independence.">

To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries. These results highlight the unique generalization capability of the proposed operator learning approach.">

        <tr id="Living organisms exhibit remarkable adaptations across all scales, from molecules to ecosystems. We believe that many of these adaptations correspond to optimal solutions driven by evolution, training, and underlying physical and chemical laws and constraints. While some argue against such optimality principles due to their potential ambiguity, we propose generalized inverse optimal control to infer them directly from data. This novel approach incorporates multi-criteria optimality, nestedness of objective functions on different scales, the presence of active constraints, the possibility of switches of optimality principles during the observed time horizon, maximization of robustness, and minimization of time as important special cases, as well as uncertainties involved with the mathematical modeling of biological systems. This data-driven approach ensures that optimality principles are not merely theoretical constructs but are firmly rooted in experimental observations. Furthermore, the inferred principles can be used in forward optimal control to predict and manipulate biological systems, with possible applications in bio-medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. As discussed and illustrated, the well-posed problem formulation and the inference are challenging and require a substantial interdisciplinary effort in the development of theory and robust numerical methods.">

        <tr id="Mathematical models are indispensable to the system biology toolkit for studying the structure and behavior of intracellular signaling networks. A common approach to modeling is to develop a system of equations that encode the known biology using approximations and simplifying assumptions. As a result, the same signaling pathway can be represented by multiple models, each with its set of underlying assumptions, which opens up challenges for model selection and decreases certainty in model predictions. Here, we use Bayesian multimodel inference to develop a framework to increase certainty in systems biology models. Using models of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we first show that multimodel inference increases predictive certainty and yields predictors that are robust to changes in the set of available models. We then show that predictions made with multi-model inference are robust to data uncertainties introduced by decreasing the measurement duration and reducing the sample size. Finally, we use multimodel inference to identify a new model to explain experimentally measured sub-cellular location-specific ERK activity dynamics. In summary, our framework highlights multimodel inference as a disciplined approach to increasing the certainty of intracellular signaling activity predictions.">

We will show the application of a stochastic coupling filter that can approximate arbitrary transition densities under non-Gaussian noise.

The goal is to minimize a cost function while satisfying constraints against the worst-case realization of the uncertainty, which is quantified using distributional ambiguity sets. The latter are defined as balls in the Wasserstein metric centered on the predictive empirical distribution computed from a set of collected trajectory data. By harnessing techniques from robust control and distributionally robust optimization, we characterize the distributional shift between the predictive and the actual closed-loop distributions, and highlight its dependency on the model mismatch and the uncertainty about the disturbance distribution. We also provide bounds on the number of samples required to achieve a desired confidence level and propose a tractable approximate formulation for the doubly robust data-driven controller.

        <tr id="In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.">

In this paper, we introduce a novel tracking controller featuring an online learning module for quadrotor residual dynamics. This module, implemented using deep Echo State Network (ESN), enhances adaptability to unforeseen scenarios, thereby extending the applicability of the controller to a broader range of situations. Furthermore, we employ post-hoc interpretation techniques tailored for the ESN to improve trustworthiness. This is achieved through dynamic system analysis and visualization of network predictions. Simulation results demonstrate the effective tracking of a figure-8 trajectory with online learning compensating for various non-parametric uncertainties, which showcases the potential of the proposed approach and estab-lishes a foundation for the real-world testing in future.">

We propose three methods, namely evolutive culling, a repair mechanism, and a multi-objective approach, to integrate the dimensional analysis in the GP algorithm. Experiments on datasets with ground truth demonstrate comparable performance of evolutive culling and the multi-objective approach to a baseline without dimensional analysis. Extensive analysis of the results on datasets without ground truth reveals that the unit-aware algorithms make only low sacrifices in accuracy, while producing unit-adherent solutions. Overall, we presented a promising novel approach for developing unit-adherent empirical equations.">

When the intrinsic noise intensity is large, these systems exhibits stochastic transitions from one metastable steady state to another. In electronic bistable memories, these transitions are failures, usually simulated in a Monte-Carlo fashion at a high CPU-time price. Existing closed-form formulas, relying on near-stable-steady-state approximations of the nonlinear system dynamics to estimate the mean transition time, have turned out inaccurate. Our contribution is twofold. From a unidimensional stochastic model of overdamped autonomous systems, we propose an extended Eyring-Kramers analytical formula accounting for both nonlinear drift and state-dependent white noise variance, rigorously derived from Itô stochastic calculus. We also adapt it to practical system engineering situations where the intrinsic noise sources are hidden and can only be inferred from the fluctuations of observables measured in steady states. First numerical trials on an industrial electronic case study suggest that our approximate prediction formula achieve remarkable accuracy, outperforming previous non-Monte-Carlo approaches.">

However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.">

        <tr id="Practical parameter identifiability in ODE-based epidemiological models is a known issue, yet one that merits further study. It is essentially ubiquitous due to noise and errors in real data. In this study, to avoid uncertainty stemming from data of unknown quality, simulated data with added noise are used to investigate practical identifiability in two distinct epidemiological models. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of initial conditions, which are assumed unknown, except those that are directly measured. Instead of just focusing on one method of estimation, we use and compare results from various broadly used methods, including maximum likelihood and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation. Among other findings, our analysis revealed that the MCMC estimator is overall more robust than the point estimators considered. Its estimates and predictions are improved when the initial conditions of certain compartments are fixed so that the model becomes globally identifiable. For the point estimators, whether fixing or fitting the that are not directly measured improves parameter estimates is model-dependent. Specifically, in the standard SEIR model, fixing the initial condition for the susceptible population S(0) improved parameter estimates, while this was not true when fixing the initial condition of the asymptomatic population in a more involved model. Our study corroborates the change in quality of parameter estimates upon usage of pre-peak or post-peak time-series under consideration. Finally, our examples suggest that in the presence of significantly noisy data, the value of structural identifiability is moot.">

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

Grammar-guided genetic programming combined with regularized least squares was applied to identify a nonlinear autoregressive model with an exogenous input (NARX) prediction model of the crane dynamics from input–output data. The resulting prediction model was implemented in the NMPC scheme, using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm as a solver to find an optimal sequence of the control actions satisfying multi-objective performance requirements and input constraints. The feasibility and performance of the controller were experimentally verified using a laboratory crane actuated by AC motors and compared with a discrete-time feedback controller developed using the pole placement technique. A series of experiments proved the effectiveness of the controller in terms of robustness against operating condition variation and external disturbances.">

To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.">

Among the available approaches, Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) are used to combine prior knowledge in the form of mechanistic formulations with universal function approximators, like neural networks. Integral to the efficacy of UDEs is the joint estimation of parameters within mechanistic formulations and the universal function approximators using empirical data. The robustness and applicability of resultant models, however, hinge upon the rigorous quantification of uncertainties associated with these parameters, as well as the predictive capabilities of the overall model or its constituent components. With this work, we provide a formalisation of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for UDEs and investigate important frequentist and Bayesian methods. By analysing three synthetic examples of varying complexity, we evaluate the validity and efficiency of ensembles, variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as epistemic UQ methods for UDEs.">

Fusing known physics into data-driven learners allows modelling practitioners to combine the expressive power of traditional machine learning with known mechanistic laws, where the objective is to enhance predictive performance, interpretability, and model generalisation. A core consideration that must be made when implementing a physics-informed learning architecture is how relevant knowledge will be embedded into the model structure, which, generally, is informed by the type of physics that is available. Frequently this knowledge may not be complete, with only a partial understanding of the governing physics available. 

In this work, possible paths for deriving Gaussian process kernels that are representative of partial knowledge will be considered. How the type of knowledge that is possessed influences the derivation will be explored, particularly when there is the potential for some aspect of misspecified physics. An example of deriving partially structured kernels will be investigated for modelling the decoupled response of a GARTEUR laboratory aircraft structure, where the derived kernels are used to decompose the dynamics of the aircraft into modal contributions.

BENN is capable of constraining not only the predicted values but also their derivatives and variances, ensuring a more robust and reliable model output. To achieve simultaneous uncertainty quantification and constraint satisfaction, we employ the method of multipliers approach. This allows for the concurrent estimation of neural network parameters and the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the constraints. Our experiments, spanning diverse applications such as beam deflection modeling and microstructure generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of BENN.

The goal of our work is to answer the question of how one should excite or control a system under consideration in an appropriate way to be able to reconstruct an unknown nonlinear relation. To answer this question, we propose a greedy reconstruction algorithm within an offline-online strategy. We apply this strategy to a two-dimensional semilinear elliptic model. Our identification is based on the application of several space-dependent excitations (also called controls). These specific controls are designed by the algorithm in order to obtain a deeper insight into the underlying physical problem and a more precise reconstruction of the unknown relation. We perform numerical simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which is not limited to the current type of equation. Since our algorithm provides not only a way to determine unknown operators by existing data but also protocols for new experiments, it is a holistic concept to tackle the problem of improving physical models.">

Our data-driven methodology simultaneously approximates the PF operator to perform prediction of the evolution of the agents and also predicts the terminal probability density of AI agents, such as robotic systems and generative models.

        <tr id="Physics-guided neural networks (PGNN) is an effective tool that combines the benefits of data-driven modeling with the interpretability and generalization of underlying physical information. However, for a classical PGNN, the penalization of the physics-guided part is at the output level, which leads to a conservative result as systems with highly similar state-transition functions, i.e. only slight differences in parameters, can have significantly different time-series outputs. Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.">

        <tr id="Predicting cancer dynamics under treatment is challenging due to high inter-patient heterogeneity, lack of predictive biomarkers, and sparse and noisy longitudinal data. Mathematical models can summarize cancer dynamics by a few interpretable parameters per patient. Machine learning methods can then be trained to predict the model parameters from baseline covariates, but do not account for uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Instead, hierarchical Bayesian modeling can model the relationship between baseline covariates to longitudinal measurements via mechanistic parameters while accounting for uncertainty in every part of the model. The mapping from baseline covariates to model parameters can be modeled in several ways. A linear mapping simplifies inference but fails to capture nonlinear covariate effects and scale poorly for interaction modeling when the number of covariates is large. In contrast, Bayesian neural networks can potentially discover interactions between covariates automatically, but at a substantial cost in computational complexity. In this work, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of subpopulation dynamics that uses baseline covariate information to predict cancer dynamics under treatment, inspired by cancer dynamics in multiple myeloma (MM), where serum M protein is a well-known proxy of tumor burden. As a working example, we apply the model to a simulated dataset and compare its ability to predict M protein trajectories to a model with linear covariate effects. Our results show that the Bayesian neural network covariate effect model predicts cancer dynamics more accurately than a linear covariate effect model when covariate interactions are present. The framework can also be applied to other types of cancer or other time series prediction problems that can be described with a parametric model.">

This paper compares and contrasts two different types of data‐driven modelling approaches, namely the series/parallel all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural network models and models from a Bayesian ML approach. Both types of AI modelling approaches considered in this work have shown to significantly outperform several state‐of‐the‐art steady‐state and dynamic data‐driven modelling techniques for various performance measures, specifically, model sparsity, predictive capabilities, and computational expense. The performances of the proposed model structures and algorithms have been evaluated for two nonlinear dynamic chemical engineering systems—a plug‐flow reactor for vapour phase cracking of acetone for production of acetic anhydride and a pilot‐plant for post‐combustion CO2 capture using monoethanolamine as the solvent. For the validation data from the CO2 capture pilot plant, root mean squared error (RMSE) for flue gas outlet temperature, flowrate and CO2 concentration is 0.05%, 1.07%, and 5.0%, respectively, for the all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural networks and 0.1%, 1.75%, and 14.14%, respectively, for the Bayesian ML models.

        <tr id="Estimating parameters of dynamic models from experimental data is a challenging, and often computationally-demanding task. It requires a large number of model simulations and objective function gradient computations, if gradient-based optimization is used. The gradient depends on derivatives of the state variables with respect to parameters, also called state sensitivities, which are expensive to compute. In many cases, steady-state computation is a part of model simulation, either due to steady-state data or an assumption that the system is at steady state at the initial time point. Various methods are available for steady-state and gradient computation. Yet, the most efficient pair of methods (one for steady states, one for gradients) for a particular model is often not clear. Moreover, depending on the model and the available data, some methods may not be applicable or sufficiently robust. In order to facilitate the selection of methods, we explore six method pairs for computing the steady state and sensitivities at steady state using six real-world problems. The method pairs involve numerical integration or Newton's method to compute the steady-state, and -- for both forward and adjoint sensitivity analysis -- numerical integration or a tailored method to compute the sensitivities at steady-state. Our evaluation shows that the two method pairs that combine numerical integration for the steady-state with a tailored method for the sensitivities at steady-state were the most robust, and amongst the most computationally-efficient. We also observed that while Newton's method for steady-state computation yields a substantial speedup compared to numerical integration, it may lead to a large number of simulation failures. Overall, our study provides a concise overview across current methods for computing sensitivities at steady state, guiding modelers to choose the right methods.">

Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds.

        <tr id="It is a grand challenge to find a feasible weather modification method to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones. Previous works have proposed potentially effective actuators and assessed their capabilities to achieve weather modification objectives through numerical simulations. However, few studies have explored efficient mathematical and computational methods to inversely determine optimal actuators from specific modification goals. Here I demonstrate the utility of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)-based control method, referred to as ensemble Kalman control (EnKC). The series of numerical experiments with the Lorenz 96 model indicates that EnKC efficiently identifies local, small, and intermittent control perturbations that can mitigate extreme events. The existing techniques of EnKF, such as background error covariance localization and observation error covariance inflation, can improve the sparsity and efficiency of the control. This work paves the way toward the real-world applications of EnKC to explore the controllability of extreme atmospheric events.">

        <tr id="Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.">

        <tr id="The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) provides a way for quantifying the information content of an observable random variable concerning unknown parameters within a model that characterizes the variable. When parameters in a model are directly linked to individual features, the diagonal elements of the FIM can signify the relative importance of each feature. However, in scenarios where feature interactions may exist, a comprehensive exploration of the full FIM is necessary rather than focusing solely on its diagonal elements. This paper presents an end-to-end black box system identification approach that integrates the FIM into the training process to gain insights into dynamic importance and overall model structure. A decision module is added to the first layer of the network to determine the relevance scores using the entire FIM as input. The forward propagation is then performed on element-wise multiplication of inputs and relevance scores. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively captures various types of interactions between dynamics, outperforming existing methods limited to polynomial interactions. Moreover, the effectiveness of this novel approach is confirmed through its application in identifying a real-world industrial system, specifically the PH neutralization process.">

        <tr id="Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated strong capabilities of representing high-dimensional, complex functional relations, and hence have been widely used to characterize complex constitutive relations for various types of materials, such as polycrystals, polymers, etc. However, to construct a reliable NN-based constitutive model, a considerable amount of data, i.e. stress-strain states along different loading paths is needed, which can be expensive to collect. To address such challenge, we develop a hybrid finite element method (FEM) - NN optimization framework to learn complex hyperelastic constitutive relations from full-field data. The key advantage of this framework is that it can make use of the non-uniform displacement field due to the geometric inhomogeneities for training NN-based constitutive models. Since such data can provide many different stress-strain states in a single test, it can greatly reduce the number of experiments needed for the training of NNs. Besides, we adopt a mechanics-informed neural network (MINN) as our architecture to ensure that our NN-based models satisfy all necessary physical constraints by construction, such as objectivity, material symmetry, polyconvexity, etc. Such architecture is also key to the convergence of our optimization framework. We then use both synthetic and experimental data to test the performance of our proposed framework on various isotropic hyperelastic materials. Results show that our optimization framework can be used to train NN-based constitutive models for hyperelastic materials with high accuracy and efficiency using data generated from simple tests, which can also be easily adapted to characterize complex constitutive models for a broader range of materials.">

In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data.

        <tr id="State estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems has long aimed to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The rapid evolution of various industries has amplified the demand for estimation frameworks that satisfy all these factors. This study introduces a neuromorphic approach for robust filtering of nonlinear dynamical systems: SNN-EMSIF (spiking neural network-extended modified sliding innovation filter). SNN-EMSIF combines the computational efficiency and scalability of SNNs with the robustness of EMSIF, an estimation framework designed for nonlinear systems with zero-mean Gaussian noise. Notably, the weight matrices are designed according to the system model, eliminating the need for a learning process. The framework's efficacy is evaluated through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing SNN-EMSIF with EKF and EMSIF. Additionally, it is compared with SNN-EKF in the presence of modeling uncertainties and neuron loss, using RMSEs as a metric. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of SNN-EMSIF. Further analysis of runtimes and spiking patterns reveals an impressive reduction of 85% in emitted spikes compared to possible spikes, highlighting the computational efficiency of SNN-EMSIF. This framework offers a promising solution for robust estimation in nonlinear dynamical systems, opening new avenues for efficient and reliable estimation in various industries that can benefit from neuromorphic computing.">

        <tr id="We consider the problem of learning the dynamics in the topology of time-evolving point clouds, the prevalent spatiotemporal model for systems exhibiting collective behavior, such as swarms of insects and birds or particles in physics. In such systems, patterns emerge from (local) interactions among self-propelled entities. While several well-understood governing equations for motion and interaction exist, they are difficult to fit to data due to the often large number of entities and missing correspondences between the observation times, which may also not be equidistant. To evade such confounding factors, we investigate collective behavior from a \textit{topological perspective}, but instead of summarizing entire observation sequences (as in prior work), we propose learning a latent dynamical model from topological features \textit{per time point}. The latter is then used to formulate a downstream regression task to predict the parametrization of some a priori specified governing equation. We implement this idea based on a latent ODE learned from vectorized (static) persistence diagrams and show that this modeling choice is justified by a combination of recent stability results for persistent homology. Various (ablation) experiments not only demonstrate the relevance of each individual model component, but provide compelling empirical evidence that our proposed model -- \textit{neural persistence dynamics} -- substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art across a diverse set of parameter regression tasks.">

This is combined with a physics-aware implicit solver that consists of a much coarser, discretized version of the original PDE, which provides the requisite information bottleneck for high-dimensional problems and enables generalization in out-of-distribution settings (e.g. different boundary conditions). We demonstrate its capability in the context of random heterogeneous materials where the input parameters represent the material microstructure. We extend the framework to multiscale problems and show that a surrogate can be learned for the effective (homogenized) solution without ever solving the reference problem.

The kernel function is constructed to emphasize low-dimensional subspaces which optimally describe the $A$ to $B$ transitions. The coefficients in the kernel model are determined using randomized linear algebra, leading to a runtime that scales linearly in the number of data points.

This phenomenon, known as causal emergence, is quantified by the indicator of effective information. However, two challenges confront this theory: the absence of well-developed frameworks in continuous stochastic dynamical systems and the reliance on coarse-graining methodologies. In this study, we introduce an exact theoretic framework for causal emergence within linear stochastic iteration systems featuring continuous state spaces and Gaussian noise. Building upon this foundation, we derive an analytical expression for effective information across general dynamics and identify optimal linear coarse-graining strategies that maximize the degree of causal emergence when the dimension averaged uncertainty eliminated by coarse-graining has an upper bound. Our investigation reveals that the maximal causal emergence and the optimal coarse-graining methods are primarily determined by the principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamic system's parameter matrix, with the latter not being unique. To validate our propositions, we apply our analytical models to three simplified physical systems, comparing the outcomes with numerical simulations, and consistently achieve congruent results.">

Due to their inherent nonlinear dynamics and memory, they can learn unbounded temporal dependencies from data.

After the training, the network parameters are kept fixed to exploit the learned computations. The static parameters thereby render the network unadaptive to changing conditions, such as external or internal perturbation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how keeping parts of the network adaptive even after the training enhances its functionality and robustness. Here, we utilize the conceptor framework and conceptualize an adaptive control loop analyzing the network's behavior continuously and adjusting its time-varying internal representation to follow a desired target. We demonstrate how the added adaptivity of the network supports the computational functionality in three distinct tasks: interpolation of temporal patterns, stabilization against partial network degradation, and robustness against input distortion. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive networks in machine learning beyond training, enabling them to not only learn complex patterns but also dynamically adjust to changing environments, ultimately broadening their applicability.">

This poses the question of how to use these data to efficiently and effectively calibrate motion models. However, typical mathematical models often overlook the inherent aspects of data collection, such as the discreteness and the experimental noise of the measured locations. In this paper, we focus on velocity-jump models suitable to describe single-agent motion in one spatial dimension, characterised by successive Markovian transitions between a finite network of $n$ states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every other state. Since the problem of finding the exact distributions of discrete-time noisy data is generally intractable, we derive a series of approximations for the data distributions and compare them to in-silico data generated by the models using four example network structures. These comparisons suggest that the approximations are accurate given sufficiently infrequent state switching, or equivalently, a sufficiently high data collection frequency. Moreover, for infrequent switching, the PDFs comparisons highlight the importance of accounting for the correlation between subsequent measured locations, due to the likely permanence in the state visited in the previous measurement. The approximate distributions computed can be used for fast parameter inference and model selection between a range of velocity-jump models using single-agent tracking data.">

While observer-based methods have been shown to improve these estimates, they rely on accurate models of the system, which are challenging to obtain in complex operating environments. In this work, we overcome this issue by learning the unknown dynamics components using Gaussian process (GP) regression. By employing the learned model in a Bayesian filtering framework, we improve the estimation accuracy and additionally obtain an observer that explicitly considers local model uncertainty in the confidence measure of the state estimate. Furthermore, we derive guaranteed estimation error bounds, thus, facilitating the use in safety-critical applications.

This paper considers the problem of inferring unknown system parameters, including the time delays, from noisy and sparse experimental data observed from the system. We propose an extension of manifold-constrained Gaussian processes to conduct parameter inference for DDEs, whereas the time delay parameters have posed a challenge for existing methods that bypass numerical solvers. Our method uses a Bayesian framework to impose a Gaussian process model over the system trajectory, conditioned on the manifold constraint that satisfies the DDEs. For efficient computation, a linear interpolation scheme is developed to approximate the values of the time-delayed system outputs, along with corresponding theoretical error bounds on the approximated derivatives. Two simulation examples, based on Hutchinson's equation and the lac operon system, together with a real-world application using Ontario COVID-19 data, are used to illustrate the efficacy of our method.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we explore the interplay between Predictive Control and closed-loop optimality, spanning from Model Predictive Control to Data-Driven Predictive Control. Predictive Control in general relies on some form of prediction scheme on the real system trajectories. However, these predictions may not accurately capture the real system dynamics, for e.g., due to stochasticity, resulting in sub-optimal control policies. This lack of optimality is a critical issue in case of problems with economic objectives. We address this by providing sufficient conditions on the underlying prediction scheme such that a Predictive Controller can achieve closed-loop optimality. However, these conditions do not readily extend to Data-Driven Predictive Control. In this context of closed-loop optimality, we conclude that the factor distinguishing the approaches within Data-Driven Predictive Control is if they can be cast as a sequential decision-making process or not, rather than the dichotomy of model-based vs. model-free. Furthermore, we show that the conventional approach of improving the prediction accuracy from data may not guarantee optimality.">

        <tr id="In this work, we present a novel methodology for performing the supervised classification of time-ordered noisy data; we call this methodology Entropic Sparse Probabilistic Approximation with Markov regularization (eSPA-Markov). It is an extension of entropic learning methodologies, allowing the simultaneous learning of segmentation patterns, entropy-optimal feature space discretizations, and Bayesian classification rules. We prove the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the learning problem solution and propose a one-shot numerical learning algorithm that—in the leading order—scales linearly in dimension. We show how this technique can be used for the computationally scalable identification of persistent (metastable) regime affiliations and regime switches from high-dimensional non-stationary and noisy time series, i.e., when the size of the data statistics is small compared to their dimensionality and when the noise variance is larger than the variance in the signal. We demonstrate its performance on a set of toy learning problems, comparing eSPA-Markov to state-of-the-art techniques, including deep learning and random forests. We show how this technique can be used for the analysis of noisy time series from DNA and RNA Nanopore sequencing.">

Especially in dynamical systems modeling, often two or more structures are combined to obtain a more powerful or efficient architecture regarding a specific application (area). Further, even physical simulations are combined with machine learning architectures, to increase prediction accuracy or optimize the computational performance. In this work, we shortly discuss, which types of models are usually combined and propose a model interface that is capable of expressing a width variety of mixed algebraic, discrete and differential equation based models. Further, we examine different established, as well as new ways of combining these models from a system theoretical point of view and highlight two challenges - algebraic loops and local event affect functions in discontinuous models - that require a special approach. Finally, we propose a new wildcard topology, that is capable of describing the generic connection between two combined models in an easy to interpret fashion that can be learned as part of a gradient based optimization procedure. The contributions of this paper are highlighted at a proof of concept: Different connection topologies between two models are learned, interpreted and compared applying the proposed methodology and software implementation.">

Unfortunately, the problem is generally ill-posed due to the possible presence of unknown delays in the measurements. In this paper, we offer a solution of this problem by using a variational Bayes framework, where the uncertainty over the delays is marginalized in order to obtain conservative coupling estimates. To overcome the well-known overconfidence of classical variational methods, we use a hybrid-VI scheme where the (possibly flat or multimodal) posterior over the measurement parameters is estimated using a forward KL loss while the (nearly convex) conditional posterior over the couplings is estimated using the highly scalable gradient-based VI. In our ground-truth experiments, we show that the network provides reliable and conservative estimates of the couplings, greatly outperforming similar methods such as regression DCM.">

        <tr id="In this article, a distributed neural network modeling framework including a novel neural hybrid system model is proposed for enhancing the scalability of neural network models in modeling dynamical systems. First, high-dimensional training data samples will be mapped to a low-dimensional feature space through the principal component analysis (PCA) featuring process. Following that, the feature space is bisected into multiple partitions based on the variation of the Shannon entropy under the maximum entropy (ME) bisecting process. The behavior of subsystems in the prespecified state space partitions will then be approximated using a group of shallow neural networks (SNNs) known as extreme learning machines (ELMs), and then it can further simplify the model by merging the redundant lattices based on their training error performance. The proposed modeling framework can handle high-dimensional dynamical system modeling problems with the advantages of reducing model complexity and improving model performance in training and verification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework, examples of modeling the LASA dataset and an industrial robot are presented.">

        <tr id="Neural networks are lately more and more often being used in the context of data-driven control, as an approximate model of the true system dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) adopts this practise leading to neural MPC strategies. This raises a question of whether the trained neural network has converged and generalized in a way that the learned model encapsulates an accurate approximation of the true dynamic model of the system, thus making it a reliable choice for model-based control, especially for disturbed and uncertain systems. To tackle that, we propose Dropout MPC, a novel sampling-based ensemble neural MPC algorithm that employs the Monte-Carlo dropout technique on the learned system model. The closed loop is based on an ensemble of predictive controllers, that are used simultaneously at each time-step for trajectory optimization. Each member of the ensemble influences the control input, based on a weighted voting scheme, thus by employing different realizations of the learned system dynamics, neural control becomes more reliable by design. An additional strength of the method is that it offers by design a way to estimate future uncertainty, leading to cautious control. While the method aims in general at uncertain systems with complex dynamics, where models derived from first principles are hard to infer, to showcase the application we utilize data gathered in the laboratory from a real mobile manipulator and employ the proposed algorithm for the navigation of the robot in simulation.">

        <tr id="In neurological networks, the emergence of various causal interactions and information flows among nodes is governed by the structural connectivity in conjunction with the node dynamics. The information flow describes the direction and the magnitude of an excitatory neuron’s influence to the neighbouring neurons. However, the intricate relationship between network dynamics and information flows is not well understood. Here, we address this challenge by first identifying a generic mechanism that defines the evolution of various information routing patterns in response to modifications in the underlying network dynamics. Moreover, with emerging techniques in brain stimulation, designing optimal stimulation directed towards a target region with an acceptable magnitude remains an ongoing and significant challenge. In this work, we also introduce techniques for computing optimal inputs that follow a desired stimulation routing path towards the target brain region. This optimization problem can be efficiently resolved using non-linear programming tools and permits the simultaneous assignment of multiple desired patterns at different instances. We establish the algebraic and graph-theoretic conditions necessary to ensure the feasibility and stability of information routing patterns (IRPs). We illustrate the routing mechanisms and control methods for attaining desired patterns in biological oscillatory dynamics. Author Summary A complex network is described by collection of subsystems or nodes, often exchanging information among themselves via fixed interconnection pattern or structure of the network. This combination of nodes, interconnection structure and the information exchange enables the overall network system to function. These information exchange patterns change over time and switch patterns whenever a node or set of nodes are subject to external perturbations or stimulations. In many cases one would want to drive the system to desired information patterns, resulting in desired network system behaviour, by appropriately designing the perturbating signals. We present mathematical framework to design perturbation signals that drive the system to the desired behaviour. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the context of brain stimulation and in modifying causal interactions in gene regulatory networks.">

Understanding these collective dynamics is crucial for deciphering a range of phenomena from brain activity to power grid stability. Recent interest in co-evolutionary networks has highlighted the intricate interplay between dynamics on and of the network with mixed time scales. Here, we explore the collective behavior of excitable oscillators in a simple networks of two Theta neurons with adaptive coupling without self-interaction. Through a combination of bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations, we seek to understand how the level of adaptivity in the coupling strength, $a$, influences the dynamics. We first investigate the dynamics possible in the non-adaptive limit; our bifurcation analysis reveals stability regions of quiescence and spiking behaviors, where the spiking frequencies mode-lock in a variety of configurations. Second, as we increase the adaptivity $a$, we observe a widening of the associated Arnol'd tongues, which may overlap and give room for multi-stable configurations. For larger adaptivity, the mode-locked regions may further undergo a period-doubling cascade into chaos. Our findings contribute to the mathematical theory of adaptive networks and offer insights into the potential mechanisms underlying neuronal communication and synchronization.">

Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.">

Furthermore, a sampling strategy was devised to assess the enhancement achieved by the acquisition function. The findings of this article reveal the superior performance of sparse Gaussian processes in conjunction with computationally inexpensive acquisition functions, thereby highlighting their suitability for addressing mixed integer nonlinear programming problems characterized by noisy functions and stochastic behavior. Consequently, this article presents a computationally efficient approach to effectively tackle the challenges associated with data‐driven mixed integer nonlinear programming problems within the domain of Process System Engineering.">

        <tr id="Reservoir computing, a machine learning framework used for modeling the brain, can predict temporal data with little observations and minimal computational resources. However, it is difficult to accurately reproduce the long-term target time series because the reservoir system becomes unstable. This predictive capability is required for a wide variety of time-series processing, including predictions of motor timing and chaotic dynamical systems. This study proposes oscillation-driven reservoir computing (ODRC) with feedback, where oscillatory signals are fed into a reservoir network to stabilize the network activity and induce complex reservoir dynamics. The ODRC can reproduce long-term target time series more accurately than conventional reservoir computing methods in a motor timing and chaotic time-series prediction tasks. Furthermore, it generates a time series similar to the target in the unexperienced period, that is, it can learn the abstract generative rules from limited observations. Given these significant improvements made by the simple and computationally inexpensive implementation, the ODRC would serve as a practical model of various time series data. Moreover, we will discuss biological implications of the ODRC, considering it as a model of neural oscillations and their cerebellar processors.">

        <tr id="This paper investigates the use of the Gaussian Process Convolution Model (GPCM) as an output only system identification tool for structural systems. The form of the model assumes a priori that the observed data arise as the result of a convolution between an unknown linear filter and an unobserved white noise process, where each of these are modelled as a GP. The GPCM infers both the linear time filter (which is the impulse response function, i.e. Green’s function, of the system) and driving white noise process in a Bayesian probabilistic fashion with an approximate variational posterior over both signals. It will be shown that although the model structure is intuitive and sensible priors are applied, the GPCM falls short in recovering the linear impulse response of interest response due to the problem of identifiability. This is an interesting result indicating that physically informed kernel structures alone are not enough to recover the true impulse response in similar non-parametric probabilistic models. Despite this, the avenue of research remains highly promising, and several ideas are proposed to improve the model as a system identification tool.">

First, we use the Grad‐Shafranov equation to numerically solve for several magnetohydrostatic equilibria which are variations on a known analytic equilibrium. These equilibria are then used as the initial conditions for Particle‐In‐Cell simulations in which the structures of interest are observed and labeled. We then take one‐dimensional slices through the simulations to replicate what a spacecraft collecting data from the simulation would observe. This sliced data then can be used as training data for the initial training of ML models intended for use on spacecraft data. We demonstrate the method applied to the problem of detecting small‐scale plasmoids in the magnetotail, which is important for understanding complex magnetotail reconnection dynamics. The simple 1D classifier we train is able to detect more than 70% of the plasmoid points in the data set but also produces a large number of false positives. Our further work on this example problem is detailed, and further potential uses of the method are discussed.">

Common examples include accounting for velocity fluctuations in a turbulent fluid flow model and cloud evolution in climate models. Most existing techniques for constructing coarse-grained models feature ill-defined parameters whose values are arbitrarily chosen (e.g., a window size), are narrow in their applicability (e.g., only applicable to time series or spatial data), or cannot readily incorporate physics information. Here, we introduce the concept of physics-guided Gaussian process regression as a machine-learning-based coarse-graining technique that is broadly applicable and amenable to input from known physics-based relationships. Using a pair of case studies derived from molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the attractive properties and superior performance of physics-guided Gaussian processes for coarse-graining relative to prevalent benchmarks. The key advantage of Gaussian-process-based coarse-graining is its ability to seamlessly integrate data-driven and physics-based information.">

Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners.

        <tr id="Intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity is nowadays understood to play a critical role in disease progression and treatment failure. Accordingly, there has been increasing interest in the development of mathematical models capable of capturing its role in cancer cell adaptation. This can be systematically achieved by means of models comprising phenotype-structured nonlocal partial differential equations, tracking the evolution of the phenotypic density distribution of the cell population, which may be compared to gene and protein expression distributions obtained experimentally. Nevertheless, given the high analytical and computational cost of solving these models, much is to be gained from reducing them to systems of ordinary differential equations for the moments of the distribution. We propose a generalised method of model-reduction, relying on the use of a moment generating function, Taylor series expansion and truncation closure, to reduce a nonlocal reaction-advection-diffusion equation, with general phenotypic drift and proliferation rate functions, to a system of moment equations up to arbitrary order. Our method extends previous results in the literature, which we address via two examples, by removing any \textit{a priori} assumption on the shape of the distribution, and provides a flexible framework for mathematical modellers to account for the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer adaptive dynamics, in a simpler mathematical framework.">

Consequently, we seek to represent a learnable distribution of high-performance preconditioners from a low-dimensional subspace through a carefully-designed autoencoder, which is able to generate SPAI preconditioners for these systems.

        <tr id="In functional data analysis, replicate observations of a smooth functional process and its derivatives offer a unique opportunity to flexibly estimate continuous-time ordinary differential equation models. Ramsay (1996) first proposed to estimate a linear ordinary differential equation from functional data in a technique called Principal Differential Analysis, by formulating a functional regression in which the highest-order derivative of a function is modelled as a time-varying linear combination of its lower-order derivatives. Principal Differential Analysis was introduced as a technique for data reduction and representation, using solutions of the estimated differential equation as a basis to represent the functional data. In this work, we re-formulate PDA as a generative statistical model in which functional observations arise as solutions of a deterministic ODE that is forced by a smooth random error process. This viewpoint defines a flexible class of functional models based on differential equations and leads to an improved understanding and characterisation of the sources of variability in Principal Differential Analysis. It does, however, result in parameter estimates that can be heavily biased under the standard estimation approach of PDA. Therefore, we introduce an iterative bias-reduction algorithm that can be applied to improve parameter estimates. We also examine the utility of our approach when the form of the deterministic part of the differential equation is unknown and possibly non-linear, where Principal Differential Analysis is treated as an approximate model based on time-varying linearisation. We demonstrate our approach on simulated data from linear and non-linear differential equations and on real data from human movement biomechanics.

        <tr id="This paper considers the extraction of sparse solutions using the L1 minimization surrogate for two approximations of the nonlinear relation between parameters and features; in the first, nonline-arity is discarded altogether and in the second a quadratic relation is assumed. The associated algorithms are the well-known Basis Pursuit (BP) and the more recently introduced Quadratic Basis Pursuit (QBP). It is contended that measuring success by comparing the extracted solutions with the underlying truth is unnecessary, as all that’s needed from the extractor is to identify a sufficiently small parameter set to render the problem determined. Specifically, with p as the number of features, one is interest in the likelihood that the algorithm leads to Ωp ∩ Θ = Θ, where Θ = true set and Ωp = set of the largest p non-zero entries in the solution. When operating in this manner the disruption that nonlinearity brings into the BP solution derives only from the nonlinearity induced rotation of the right-hand side away from the span of the column partition of the Jacobian for the non-zero entries. From this perspective one expects performance to deteriorate only weakly with the extent of damage and this result is numerically con-firmed. It is found that although QBP has the quadratic premise as an advantage over BP, the perfor-mance in simulations, due to the difficulty in obtaining optimal values for the free parameters (and the fact that damage extent prediction was not relevant) proved somewhat poorer than BP.">

        <tr id="Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e.,"steering") the distribution of an ensemble system. In addition, in most of the existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Both linear and nonlinear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide numerical results to validate our theoretical developments. These include cases where the parameter distribution is uniform, Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and multi-modal, respectively.">

        <tr id="Here we test the Stochastic Dynamic Operator (SDO) as a new framework for describing physiological signal dynamics relative to spiking or stimulus events. The SDO is a natural extension of existing spike-triggered averaging (STA), or stimulus-triggered averaging, methods currently used in neural analysis. It extends the classic STA to cover state-dependent and probabilistic responses where STA may fail. SDO methods are more sensitive and specific than the STA for identifying state-dependent relationships in simulated data. We have tested SDO analysis for interactions between electrophysiological recordings of spinal interneurons, single motor units, and aggregate muscle electromyograms (EMG) of major muscles in the spinal frog hindlimb. When predicting target signal behavior relative to spiking events, the SDO framework outperformed or matched classical spike-triggered averaging methods. SDO analysis permits more complicated spike-signal relationships to be captured, analyzed, and interpreted visually and intuitively. SDO methods can be applied at different scales of interest where spike-triggered averaging methods are currently employed, and beyond, from single neurons to gross motor behaviors. SDOs may be readily generated and analyzed using the provided SDO Analysis Toolkit. We anticipate this method will be broadly useful for describing dynamical signal behavior and uncovering state-dependent relationships of stochastic signals relative to discrete event times. SIGNIFICANCE Here the authors introduce new tools and demonstrate data analysis using a new probabilistic and state-dependent technique, which is an expansion and extension of the classical spike-triggered average, the Stochastic Dynamic Operator. Stochastic Dynamic Operator methods extend application into domains where classical spike triggered averages fail, capture more information on spike correlations, and match or outperform the spike-triggered average when generating predictions of signal amplitude based on spiking events. A data and code package toolkit for utilizing and interpreting Stochastic Dynamic Operator methods is provided together with example analyses. Both the method and the associated toolkit are thus expected to be broadly useful in research domains where the spike triggered average is currently used for analysis, and beyond.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems, e.g. in climate and engineering sciences, often necessitates solving partial differential equations. Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets.

        <tr id="Utilizing machine learning to address partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges due to the diversity of spatial domains and their corresponding state configurations, which complicates the task of encompassing all potential scenarios through data-driven methodologies alone. Moreover, there are legitimate concerns regarding the generalization and reliability of such approaches, as they often overlook inherent physical constraints. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel machine-learning architecture that is highly generalizable and adheres to conservation laws and physical symmetries, thereby ensuring greater reliability. The foundation of this architecture is graph neural networks (GNNs), which are adept at accommodating a variety of shapes and forms. Additionally, we explore the parallels between GNNs and traditional numerical solvers, facilitating a seamless integration of conservative principles and symmetries into machine learning models. Our findings from experiments demonstrate that the model's inclusion of physical laws significantly enhances its generalizability, i.e., no significant accuracy degradation for unseen spatial domains while other models degrade.

        <tr id="Studying the temporal evolution of complex systems requires tools able to detect the presence and quantify the strength of predictable dynamics within their output signals. Information theory aids in such a description, particularly through information storage (IS), which reflects the regularity of system dynamics by measuring the information shared between the present and the past system states. While the conventional IS computation provides an overall measure of predictable information, transient behaviors of predictability occurring during system transitions can be assessed by time-resolved measures such as the local information storage (L-IS), assuming stationarity, and the time-varying information storage (TV-IS), without stationarity assumptions. In this work, through a comparative analysis in simulated and real contexts, we aim to demonstrate how these methods complement each other and reveal dynamic changes of the system behavior associated to state transitions. In simulations, we show that the TV-IS can effectively track sudden changes of the information stored in the system, which is reflected in its average value computed over specific time intervals; on the other hand, the surprise originated by the emergence of a change in the predictability of the system is reflected in the variance of the L-IS computed within specific time intervals. In neurophysiological applications, the distinct phenomena of respiratory activity in sleep apnea and brain activity during somatosensory stimulation both reveal a significant decrease of IS evoked by state transitions, highlighting how such transitions can inject new information in physiological systems, affecting significantly their internal dynamics. Overall, TV-IS and L-IS appear to provide different and complementary information about the behavior of the systems under investigation, thereby offering valuable tools for the study of complex physiological systems where both stationary and non-stationary conditions may be present.">

        <tr id="Neural network-based approaches have recently shown significant promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering, especially in scenarios featuring complex domains or the incorporation of empirical data. One advantage of the neural network method for PDEs lies in its automatic differentiation (AD), which necessitates only the sample points themselves, unlike traditional finite difference (FD) approximations that require nearby local points to compute derivatives. In this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of AD in training neural networks. The concept of truncated entropy is introduced to characterize the training property. Specifically, through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses conducted on random feature models and two-layer neural networks, we discover that the defined truncated entropy serves as a reliable metric for quantifying the residual loss of random feature models and the training speed of neural networks for both AD and FD methods. Our experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that, from a training perspective, AD outperforms FD in solving partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Localized persistent neural activity has been shown to serve delayed estimation of continuous variables. Common experiments require that subjects store and report the feature value (e.g., orientation) of a particular cue (e.g., oriented bar on a screen) after a delay. Visualizing recorded activity of neurons according to their feature tuning reveals activity bumps whose centers wander stochastically, degrading the estimate over time. Bump position therefore represents the remembered estimate. Recent work suggests that bump amplitude may represent estimate certainty reflecting a probabilistic population code for a Bayesian posterior. Idealized models of this type are fragile due to the fine tuning common to constructed continuum attractors in dynamical systems. Here we propose an alternative metastable model for robustly supporting multiple bump amplitudes by extending neural circuit models to include quantized nonlinearities. Asymptotic projections of circuit activity produce low-dimensional evolution equations for the amplitude and position of bump solutions in response to external stimuli and noise perturbations. Analysis of reduced equations accurately characterizes phase variance and the dynamics of amplitude transitions between stable discrete values. More salient cues generate bumps of higher amplitude which wander less, consistent with the experimental finding that greater certainty correlates with more accurate memories.">

        <tr id="A fast solution of supersonic flow is one of the crucial challenges in engineering applications of supersonic flight. This article introduces a deep learning framework, the supersonic physics-constrained network (SPC), for the rapid solution of unsteady supersonic flow problems. SPC integrates deep convolutional neural networks with physics-constrained methods based on the Euler equation to derive a new loss function that can accurately calculate the flow fields by considering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow fields at the previous moment. Compared to purely data-driven methods, SPC significantly reduces the dependency on training data volume by incorporating physical constraints. Additionally, the training process of SPC is more stable than that of data-driven methods. Taking the classic supersonic forward step flow as an example, SPC can accurately calculate strong discontinuities in the flow fields, while reducing the data volume by approximately 60%. In the generalization test experiment for forward step flow and compression ramp flow, SPC also demonstrates good predictive accuracy and generalization capability under different geometric configurations and inflow conditions.">

Instead of relying on petabyte-scale data-driven learning, ElastoGen leverages the principles of physics-in-the-loop and learns from established physical knowledge, such as partial differential equations and their numerical solutions. The core idea of ElastoGen is converting the global differential operator, corresponding to the nonlinear elastodynamic equations, into iterative local convolution-like operations, which naturally fit modern neural networks. Each network module is specifically designed to support this goal rather than functioning as a black box. As a result, ElastoGen is exceptionally lightweight in terms of both training requirements and network scale. Additionally, due to its alignment with physical procedures, ElastoGen efficiently generates accurate dynamics for a wide range of hyperelastic materials and can be easily integrated with upstream and downstream deep modules to enable end-to-end 4D generation.">

Since the control input only appears in the ODE subsystem rather than directly on the boundary of PDE subsystem, the control task becomes quite challenging. The most important is that for the control of such ODE controlled PDE systems we mainly make the following two contributions: (1) the controlled output of the PDE system tracks the reference signal within the prescribed time; (2) the controlled output and all the actuator states are constrained. It is the first time that such a prescribed‐time constrained tracking control problem is addressed for the PDE‐ODE coupled system considered in this article. Through rigorous theoretical proof, it is demonstrated that all the system states and control signals are bounded and sufficiently continuous by configuring appropriate design parameters. Finally, the performance is investigated via numerical simulation.">

        <tr id="Inverse stochastic resonance (ISR) is a phenomenon where noise reduces rather than increases the firing rate of a neuron, sometimes leading to complete quiescence. ISR was first experimentally verified with cerebellar Purkinje neurons. These experiments showed that ISR enables optimal information transfer between the input and output spike train of neurons. Subsequent studies demonstrated the efficiency of information processing and transfer in neural networks with small-world topology. We conducted a numerical investigation into the impact of adaptivity on ISR in a small-world network of noisy FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons, operating in a bistable regime with a stable fixed point and a limit cycle -- a prerequisite for ISR. Our results show that the degree of ISR is highly dependent on the FHN model's timescale separation parameter $\epsilon$. The network structure undergoes dynamic adaptation via mechanisms of either spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) with potentiation-/depression-domination parameter $P$, or homeostatic structural plasticity (HSP) with rewiring frequency $F$. We demonstrate that both STDP and HSP amplify ISR when $\epsilon$ lies within the bistability region of FHN neurons. Specifically, at larger values of $\epsilon$ within the bistability regime, higher rewiring frequencies $F$ enhance ISR at intermediate (weak) synaptic noise intensities, while values of $P$ consistent with depression-domination (potentiation-domination) enhance (deteriorate) ISR. Moreover, although STDP and HSP parameters may jointly enhance ISR, $P$ has a greater impact on ISR compared to $F$. Our findings inform future ISR enhancement strategies in noisy artificial neural circuits, aiming to optimize information transfer between input and output spike trains in neuromorphic systems, and prompt venues for experiments in neural networks.">

        <tr id="The probabilistic characterization of non-Markovian responses to nonlinear dynamical systems under colored excitation is an important issue, arising in many applications. Extending the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, governing the first-order response probability density function (pdf), to this case is a complicated task calling for special treatment. In this work, a new pdf-evolution equation is derived for the response of nonlinear dynamical systems under additive colored Gaussian noise. The derivation is based on the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), transformed, by means of an extended version of the Novikov-Furutsu theorem, to an exact yet non-closed equation, involving averages over the history of the functional derivatives of the non-Markovian response with respect to the excitation. The latter are calculated exactly by means of the state-transition matrix of variational, time-varying systems. Subsequently, an approximation scheme is implemented, relying on a decomposition of the state-transition matrix in its instantaneous mean value and its fluctuation around it. By a current-time approximation to the latter, we obtain our final equation, in which the effect of the instantaneous mean value of the response is maintained, rendering it nonlinear and non-local in time. Numerical results for the response pdf are provided for a bistable Duffing oscillator, under Gaussian excitation. The pdfs obtained from the solution of the novel equation and a simpler small correlation time (SCT) pdf-evolution equation are compared to Monde Carlo (MC) simulations. The novel equation outperforms the SCT equation as the excitation correlation time increases, keeping good agreement with the MC simulations.">

        <tr id="Thanks to their simple architecture, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting interpretable insights from data. However, training RBMs, as other energy-based models, on highly structured data poses a major challenge, as effective training relies on mixing the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations used to estimate the gradient. This process is often hindered by multiple second-order phase transitions and the associated critical slowdown. In this paper, we present an innovative method in which the principal directions of the dataset are integrated into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization procedure. This approach enables efficient sampling of the equilibrium measure via a static Monte Carlo process. By starting the standard training process with a model that already accurately represents the main modes of the data, we bypass the initial phase transitions. Our results show that this strategy successfully trains RBMs to capture the full diversity of data in datasets where previous methods fail. Furthermore, we use the training trajectories to propose a new sampling method, {\em parallel trajectory tempering}, which allows us to sample the equilibrium measure of the trained model much faster than previous optimized MCMC approaches and a better estimation of the log-likelihood. We illustrate the success of the training method on several highly structured datasets.">

        <tr id="Physical learning is an emerging paradigm in science and engineering whereby (meta)materials acquire desired macroscopic behaviors by exposure to examples. So far, it has been applied to static properties such as elastic moduli and self-assembled structures encoded in minima of an energy landscape. Here, we extend this paradigm to dynamic functionalities, such as motion and shape change, that are instead encoded in limit cycles or pathways of a dynamical system. We identify the two ingredients needed to learn time-dependent behaviors irrespective of experimental platforms: (i) learning rules with time delays and (ii) exposure to examples that break time-reversal symmetry during training. After providing a hands-on demonstration of these requirements using programmable LEGO toys, we turn to realistic particle-based simulations where the training rules are not programmed on a computer. Instead, we elucidate how they emerge from physico-chemical processes involving the causal propagation of fields, like in recent experiments on moving oil droplets with chemotactic signalling. Our trainable particles can self-assemble into structures that move or change shape on demand, either by retrieving the dynamic behavior previously seen during training, or by learning on the fly. This rich phenomenology is captured by a modified Hopfield spin model amenable to analytical treatment. The principles illustrated here provide a step towards von Neumann's dream of engineering synthetic living systems that adapt to the environment.">

The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible. While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii). The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.">

        <tr id="Recurrent neural networks exhibit chaotic dynamics when the variance in their connection strengths exceed a critical value. Recent work indicates connection variance also modulates learning strategies; networks learn ”rich” representations when initialized with low coupling and ”lazier”solutions with larger variance. Using Watts-Strogatz networks of varying sparsity, structure, and hidden weight variance, we find that the critical coupling strength dividing chaotic from ordered dynamics also differentiates rich and lazy learning strategies. Training moves both stable and chaotic networks closer to the edge of chaos, with networks learning richer representations before the transition to chaos. In contrast, biologically realistic connectivity structures foster stability over a wide range of variances. The transition to chaos is also reflected in a measure that clinically discriminates levels of consciousness, the perturbational complexity index (PCIst). Networks with high values of PCIst exhibit stable dynamics and rich learning, suggesting a consciousness prior may promote rich learning. The results suggest a clear relationship between critical dynamics, learning regimes and complexity-based measures of consciousness.">

In particular, we transform the affine coupling blocks of INNs into a symbolic framework, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable symbolic invertible architecture that allows for efficient gradient-based learning. The proposed ISR framework also relies on sparsity promoting regularization, allowing the discovery of concise and interpretable invertible expressions. We show that ISR can serve as a (symbolic) normalizing flow for density estimation tasks.

Such networks have a variety of hallmark properties: the outputs depend on the inputs via compressive nonlinearities such as cubic roots, and both the timescales of relaxation and the length-scales of signal propagation depend sensitively on the inputs as power laws, both diverging as the input to 0. The basic dynamical mechanism is that inputs to the network generate ongoing activity, which in turn controls how additional inputs or signals propagate spatially or attenuate in time. We present analytical solutions for the steady states when the network is forced with a single oscillation and when a background value creates a steady state of ongoing activity, and derive the relationships shaping the value of the temporal decay and spatial propagation length as a function of this background value.">

        <tr id="Machine learning is increasingly employed in engineering, with one of its primary applications being the construction of surrogate models to replace computationally expensive physical models for analysis and design, especially control co-design which integrates physical and control system design. In cases where generating labels for training through physical models is computationally intensive, label-free machine learning offers a viable alternative. However, surrogate models built from label-free machine learning typically have prediction errors, which can be characterized and quantified through epistemic uncertainty, representing model-form uncertainty. Moreover, when these surrogate models are used in optimization design for real-world applications, inherent random variables introduce aleatory uncertainty. This study introduces a robust design optimization method that addresses the intertwined epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. By optimizing both the average product performance and reducing uncertainty stemming from the coupled uncertainty, the method achieves improved robustness. A four-bar linkage mechanism design serves as a demonstration of this approach. The surrogate model for the design is constructed using label-free neural network, accommodating a system of physical equations. The error of the surrogate model is assessed through Gaussian Process regression, using existing training points and derivatives of the physical equations at these points. The design of the four-bar linkage aims to minimize both its average motion error and the variability of the error attributed to coupled uncertainty.">

Since the conventional MPC formulation requires the full state vector, it is necessary to design a state observer that estimates the unmeasurable states of the system. Due to the fact that the accuracy of the state estimation significantly affects the resulting performance of MPC, the aim of this study is to compare the designed control while considering two different approaches to the state estimation. In particular, the Luenberger state observer and the Kalman filter are studied in this paper. The Luenberger observer represents the deterministic state estimator, that considers a system without significant noise affecting the states and the output, while its design is based on the pole placement method. In contrast, the statistically optimal state estimator is based on the Kalman filter design to estimate the state in the case of stochastic systems. The rest of the paper presents the results of simulations of MPC applied to the Van de Vusse reaction model using both considered state estimators.">

        <tr id="Efficient coding theory posits that sensory circuits transform natural signals into neural representations that maximize information transmission subject to resource constraints. Local interneurons are thought to play an important role in these transformations, shaping patterns of circuit activity to facilitate and direct information flow. However, the relationship between these coordinated, nonlinear, circuit-level transformations and the properties of interneurons (e.g., connectivity, activation functions, response dynamics) remains unknown. Here, we propose a normative computational model that establishes such a relationship. Our model is derived from an optimal transport objective that conceptualizes the circuit's input-response function as transforming the inputs to achieve a target response distribution. The circuit, which is comprised of primary neurons that are recurrently connected to a set of local interneurons, continuously optimizes this objective by dynamically adjusting both the synaptic connections between neurons as well as the interneuron activation functions. In an application motivated by redundancy reduction theory, we demonstrate that when the inputs are natural image statistics and the target distribution is a spherical Gaussian, the circuit learns a nonlinear transformation that significantly reduces statistical dependencies in neural responses. Overall, our results provide a framework in which the distribution of circuit responses is systematically and nonlinearly controlled by adjustment of interneuron connectivity and activation functions.">

        <tr id="We introduce a machine learning (ML) supervised model function that is inspired by the variational principle of physics. This ML hypothesis evolutionary method, termed ML-Omega, allows us to go from data to differential equation(s) underlying the physical (chemical, engineering, etc.) phenomena the data are derived from. The fundamental equations of physics can be derived from this ML-Omega evolutionary method when provided the proper training data. By training the ML-Omega model function with only three hydrogen-like atom energies, the method can find Schr\"odinger's exact functional and, from it, Schr\"odinger's fundamental equation. Then, in the field of density functional theory (DFT), when the model function is trained with the energies from the known Thomas-Fermi (TF) formula E = -0.7687Z^7/3, it correctly finds the exact TF functional. Finally, the method is applied to find a local orbital-free (OF) functional expression of the independent electron kinetic energy functional Ts based on the gamma-TF-lambda-vW model. By considering the theoretical energies of only 5 atoms (He, Be, Ne, Mg, Ar) as the training set, the evolutionary ML-Omega method finds an ML-Omega-OF-DFT local Ts functional (gamma-TF-lambda-vW (0.964, 1/4)) that outperforms all the OF- DFT functionals of a representative group. Moreover, our ML-Omega-OF functional overcomes the LDA's and some local GGA-DFT's functionals' difficulty to describe the stretched bond region at the correct spin configuration of diatomic molecules. Although our evolutionary ML-Omega model function can work without an explicit prior-form functional, by using the techniques of symbolic regression, in this work we exploit prior-form functional expressions to make the training process faster in the example problems presented here.">

Under different environmental perturbations, each biological system exhibits a unique, structured phenotypic response. This structure can be learned based on limited data and once learned, can constrain subsequent quantitative predictions. We demonstrate that SAR requires significantly fewer data comparing to other existing machine-learning methods to achieve a high prediction accuracy, first on simulated data, then on experimental data of various systems and input dimensions. We then show how a learned structure can guide effective design of new experiments. Our approach has implications for predictive control of biological systems and an integration of machine learning prediction and experimental design.">

To overcome these problems, we propose a method by leveraging deep learning technology, Koopman operator theory, and random set theory.

A sampling-based approach, ASKU, performing reachability analysis for the DIKU is developed to approximate the TIS of nonlinear control systems online. Furthermore, we design an online time-informed SKMP using a direct sampling technique to draw uniform random samples in the TIS. Simulation experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing works, approximating TIS in near real-time and achieving superior planning performance in several time-optimal kinodynamic motion planning problems.">

This kind of model focuses on global interpolation of the training data and thus requires a large network structure. The process is both time consuming and computationally costly. In the present study, we develop a neural network with local converging input (NNLCI) for high-fidelity prediction using unstructured data. The framework uses the local domain of dependence with converging coarse solutions as input, thereby greatly reducing computational resource and training time. As a validation case, the NNLCI method is applied to study two-dimensional inviscid supersonic flows in channels with bumps. Different bump geometries and locations are examined to benchmark the effectiveness and versatility of this new approach. The NNLCI method can accurately and efficiently capture the structure and dynamics of the entire flowfield, including regions with shock discontinuities. For a new bump configuration, the method can perform prediction with only one neural network, eliminating the need for repeated training of multiple networks for different geometries. A saving of computing wall time is achieved by several orders of magnitude against the high-fidelity simulation with the same level of accuracy. The demand on training data is modest, and the training data can be allocated sparsely. These features are especially advantageous compared with conventional global-to-global deep learning methods and physics-informed methods.">

        <tr id="In the context of structural health monitoring (SHM), the selection and extraction of damage-sensitive features from raw sensor recordings represent a critical step towards solving the inverse problem underlying the structural health identification. This work introduces a new way to enhance stochastic approaches to SHM through the use of deep neural networks. A learnable feature extractor and a feature-oriented surrogate model are synergistically exploited to evaluate a likelihood function within a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. The feature extractor undergoes a supervised pairwise training to map sensor recordings onto a low-dimensional metric space, which encapsulates the sensitivity to structural health parameters. The surrogate model maps the structural health parameters onto their feature description. The procedure enables the updating of beliefs about structural health parameters, effectively replacing the need for a computationally expensive numerical (finite element) model. A preliminary offline phase involves the generation of a labeled dataset to train both the feature extractor and the surrogate model. Within a simulation-based SHM framework, training vibration responses are cost-effectively generated by means of a multi-fidelity surrogate modeling strategy to approximate sensor recordings under varying damage and operational conditions. The multi-fidelity surrogate exploits model order reduction and artificial neural networks to speed up the data generation phase while ensuring the damage-sensitivity of the approximated signals. The proposed strategy is assessed through three synthetic case studies, demonstrating remarkable results in terms of accuracy of the estimated quantities and computational efficiency.">

        <tr id="This letter presents a high-dimensional analysis of the training dynamics for a single-layer nonlinear contrastive learning model. The empirical distribution of the model weights converges to a deterministic measure governed by a McKean-Vlasov nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). Under L2 regularization, this PDE reduces to a closed set of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), reflecting the evolution of the model performance during the training process. We analyze the fixed point locations and their stability of the ODEs unveiling several interesting findings. First, only the hidden variable's second moment affects feature learnability at the state with uninformative initialization. Second, higher moments influence the probability of feature selection by controlling the attraction region, rather than affecting local stability. Finally, independent noises added in the data argumentation degrade performance but negatively correlated noise can reduces the variance of gradient estimation yielding better performance. Despite of the simplicity of the analyzed model, it exhibits a rich phenomena of training dynamics, paving a way to understand more complex mechanism behind practical large models.">

        <tr id="Modeling and predicting grid frequency is an important task in power system control. While the consideration of external techno-economic features could improve the modeling of the short-term dynamics of grid frequency, such features are often only recorded on an hourly basis and require careful treatment. We present a purely data-driven approach to modeling grid frequency as an alternative to prediction models incorporating physical characteristics of power systems. Using sequence models such as gated recurrent units and transformers, we extract the necessary information and relationships from the static frequency vector to predict the process parameters for the short-term dynamics of frequency following a Gaussian process. Both for the evaluation measures (e.g. MSE, MAE, RMSE) for point estimators and for the measures for probalistic evaluations (e.g. Negative Log Likelihood Score, CPRS and Energy Score), our prediction performance is comparable to state-of-the-art models and outperforms various purely data-driven models such as daily profiles and k-nearest-neighbour profiles. Moreover, synthetic time series generated by our models can successfully reproduce the main statistical characteristics of the grid frequency.">

        <tr id="We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the 'explicit' dynamics of the object with an 'implicit' flow on free energy gradients - a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.">

        <tr id="A persistent challenge in tasks involving large-scale dynamical systems, such as state estimation and error reduction, revolves around processing the collected measurements. Frequently, these data suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased computational demands in data processing methodologies. Recent scholarly investigations have underscored the utility of delineating collective states and dynamics via moment-based representations. These representations serve as a form of sufficient statistics for encapsulating collective characteristics, while simultaneously permitting the retrieval of individual data points. In this paper, we reshape the Kalman filter methodology, aiming its application in the moment domain of an ensemble system and developing the basis for moment ensemble noise filtering. The moment system is defined with respect to the normalized Legendre polynomials, and it is shown that its orthogonal basis structure introduces unique benefits for the application of Kalman filter for both i.i.d. and universal Gaussian disturbances. The proposed method thrives from the reduction in problem dimension, which is unbounded within the state-space representation, and can achieve significantly smaller values when converted to the truncated moment-space. Furthermore, the robustness of moment data toward outliers and localized inaccuracies is an additional positive aspect of this approach. The methodology is applied for an ensemble of harmonic oscillators and units following aircraft dynamics, with results showcasing a reduction in both cumulative absolute error and covariance with reduced calculation cost due to the realization of operations within the moment framework conceived.">

        <tr id="Learning from expert demonstrations to flexibly program an autonomous system with complex behaviors or to predict an agent's behavior is a powerful tool, especially in collaborative control settings. A common method to solve this problem is inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), where the observed agent, e.g., a human demonstrator, is assumed to behave according to the optimization of an intrinsic cost function that reflects its intent and informs its control actions. While the framework is expressive, it is also computationally demanding and generally lacks convergence guarantees. We therefore propose a novel, stability-certified IRL approach by reformulating the cost function inference problem to learning control Lyapunov functions (CLF) from demonstrations data. By additionally exploiting closed-form expressions for associated control policies, we are able to efficiently search the space of CLFs by observing the attractor landscape of the induced dynamics. For the construction of the inverse optimal CLFs, we use a Sum of Squares and formulate a convex optimization problem. We present a theoretical analysis of the optimality properties provided by the CLF and evaluate our approach using both simulated and real-world data.">

We develop an algorithm for determining a sparse actuator schedule that ensures the existence of a sparse control input sequence, following the schedule, that takes the system from any given initial state to any desired final state. Since such an actuator schedule is not unique, we look for a schedule that minimizes the energy of sparse inputs. For this, we optimize the trace of the inverse of the resulting controllability Gramian, which is an approximate measure of the average energy of the inputs. We present a greedy algorithm along with its theoretical guarantees. Finally, we empirically show that our greedy algorithm ensures the controllability of the linear system with a small number of active actuators per time step without a significant average energy expenditure compared to the fully actuated system.">

        <tr id="We propose a novel reduced-order methodology to describe complex multi-frequency fluid dynamics from time-resolved snapshot data. Starting point is the Cluster-based Network Model (CNM) thanks to its fully automatable development and human interpretability. Our key innovation is to model the transitions from cluster to cluster much more accurately by replacing snapshot states with short-term trajectories ("orbits") over multiple clusters, thus avoiding nonphysical intra-cluster diffusion in the dynamic reconstruction. The proposed orbital CNM (oCNM) employs functional clustering to coarse-grain the short-term trajectories. Specifically, different filtering techniques, resulting in different temporal basis expansions, demonstrate the versatility and capability of the oCNM to adapt to diverse flow phenomena. The oCNM is illustrated on the Stuart-Landau oscillator and its post-transient solution with time-varying parameters to test its ability to capture the amplitude selection mechanism and multi-frequency behaviours. Then, the oCNM is applied to the fluidic pinball across varying flow regimes at different Reynolds numbers, including the periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics. This orbital-focused perspective enhances the understanding of complex temporal behaviours by incorporating high-frequency behaviour into the kinematics of short-time trajectories while modelling the dynamics of the lower frequencies. In analogy to Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, which marked the transition from spatial-only modes to spatio-temporal ones, this work advances from analysing temporal local states to examining piecewise short-term trajectories, or orbits. By merging advanced analytical methods, such as the functional representation of short-time trajectories with CNM, this study paves the way for new approaches to dissect the complex dynamics characterising turbulent systems.">

The focus is on systems with unknown disturbances whose effects on the dynamics of the system is nonlinear. The specifications are assumed to be given as linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf) formulas. Starting from observations of either the disturbance or the state of the system, we first learn an ambiguity set that contains the unknown distribution of the disturbances with a user-defined confidence. Next, we construct a robust Markov decision process (RMDP) as a finite abstraction of the system. By composing the RMDP with the automaton obtained from the LTLf formula and performing optimal robust value iteration on the composed RMDP, we synthesize a strategy that yields a high probability that the uncertain system satisfies the specifications. Our empirical evaluations on systems with a wide variety of disturbances show that the strategies synthesized with our approach lead to high satisfaction probabilities and validate the theoretical guarantees.">

CTRNNs are known to be universal dynamical approximators: given a large enough system, the parameters of a CTRNN can be tuned to produce output that is arbitrarily close to that of any other dynamical system. However, in practice, both designing systems of CTRNN to have a certain output, and the reverse-understanding the dynamics of a given system of CTRNN-can be nontrivial. In this article, we describe a method for embedding any specified Turing machine in its entirety into a CTRNN. As such, we describe in detail a continuous time dynamical system that performs arbitrary discrete-state computations. We suggest that in acting as both a continuous time dynamical system and as a computer, the study of such systems can help refine and advance the debate concerning the Computational Hypothesis that cognition is a form of computation and the Dynamical Hypothesis that cognitive systems are dynamical systems.">

A wide array of experimental work has shown that the collective activity of neural populations encodes and processes this constant bombardment of information. How these collective patterns of activity depend on single neuron properties is often unclear. Single-neuron recordings have shown that individual neural responses to inputs are nonlinear, which prevents a straightforward extrapolation from single neuron features to emergent collective states. In this work, we use a field theoretic formulation of a stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire model to study the impact of nonlinear intensity functions on macroscopic network activity. We show that the interplay between nonlinear spike emission and membrane potential resets can i) give rise to metastable transitions between active firing rate states, and ii) can enhance or suppress mean firing rates and membrane potentials in opposite directions.">

In the foreseeable near future, human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will continue to predominate, and a digital replica of the transportation system should reflect their behavioral patterns for enhanced simulation realism purposes. As such, stochastic driver behavior and vehicle dynamics should be respected. The observations serving as DT input, often captured at discrete moments (e.g., the roadside units and cameras are only installed at certain locations), result in discontinuously captured vehicle trajectories. The stochastic generation of behaviorally consistent vehicle trajectories conditional on such incomplete information becomes important. Current conditional approaches include modified Brownian bridge (MBB) and guided proposal bridge (GPB) may not be able to output realistic results. To fill this gap, we propose conditional generation methods of behaviorally consistent trajectories, employing the stochastic bridge approach for the first time. First, a vehicular dynamics model that encapsulates the stochasticity of the human–vehicle system is employed, and then we prove that MBB and GPB fail to generate satisfactory results. Then, a forward–backward method is proposed based on the backward Markov process, which takes the vehicular dynamics model as behavioral input. The proposed method is validated against real-world data and mainstream simulation platforms, showing that the forward–backward generation method provides consistent and realistic results. Its time consumption has also been proven to be promising for real-time DT applications.">

        <tr id="With the current growing availability of datasets coming from multiple sources and domains, systems onboard our military assets have an immediate need of being functional in multiple domains, handling large amounts of data, and implementing fast and appropriate analyses for these datasets. However, onboard systems often have very limited computational resources upon which to process these tasks. Generalized additive models (GAMs), which are statistical model that are better able to account for non-linear relationships between independent and dependent variables, have been shown in multiple application areas to yield more accurate estimates than models that only assume linear relationships. GAMs require fitting smooth functions of independent variables, and potentially interactions between two or more independent variables with tensor products, commonly using penalized basis splines (P-splines). However, when trying to make predictions for previously unseen feature vectors and without the benefit of significant computing power and necessary software packages, computing the necessary P-spline basis values in order to make predictions becomes computationally intractable. We show that approximating the smooth functions of a trained GAM with cubic splines yields very good estimates that result in minimal loss of accurate compared to the original trained GAM model while significantly decreasing computational cost. These two benefits have resulted in our method being adopted by a primary contractor handling high-fidelity analyses. We will show our implementation results on simulated and real datasets, discuss our findings, and conclude with remarks on future work.">

This can be regarded as a variant of the Furutsu-Novikov theorem for the case of shot noise. As we show, the relation is still valid in the presence of additional independent noise. Furthermore, we derive an extension to Cox-process input, i.e. to colored shot noise. We discuss applications to particle detection and to neuroscience. Using the new relation, we obtain a fluctuation-response-relation for a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. We also show how the new relation can be used in a remote control problem in a recurrent neural network. The relations are numerically tested for both stationary and non-stationary dynamics.

        <tr id="This paper presents a novel Wasserstein distributionally robust control and state estimation algorithm for partially observable linear stochastic systems, where the probability distributions of disturbances and measurement noises are unknown. Our method consists of the control and state estimation phases to handle distributional ambiguities of system disturbances and measurement noises, respectively. Leveraging tools from modern distributionally robust optimization, we consider an approximation of the control problem with an arbitrary nominal distribution and derive its closed-form optimal solution. We show that the separation principle holds, thereby allowing the state estimator to be designed separately. A novel distributionally robust Kalman filter is then proposed as an optimal solution to the state estimation problem with Gaussian nominal distributions. Our key contribution is the combination of distributionally robust control and state estimation into a unified algorithm. This is achieved by formulating a tractable semidefinite programming problem that iteratively determines the worst-case covariance matrices of all uncertainties, leading to a scalable and efficient algorithm. Our method is also shown to enjoy a guaranteed cost property as well as a probabilistic out-of-sample performance guarantee. The results of our numerical experiments demonstrate the performance and computational efficiency of the proposed method.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models excel at creating visually-convincing images, but they often struggle to meet subtle constraints inherent in the training data. Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model not only improves its distribution-matching accuracy but also makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are inflexible with different types of constraints. Recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs) in an unconstrained space defined by a mirror map and to impose the constraint with an inverse mirror map, but analytical mirror maps are challenging to derive for complex constraints. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that pushes data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.">

In this study, we utilize Bayesian formalism to analytically examine the propagation of probability in the modeling process and propose quantitative assessments for it. Upon which, we develop a method for optimizing models for complex systems by (i) minimizing model uncertainty; (ii) maximizing model consistency; and (iii) minimizing model complexity, following the Bayesian Occam’s razor rationale. We showcase the benefits of this method by optimizing the modeling of the dynamic system of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, leading to an optimized model that demonstrates better alignment with experimental observations compared to the non-optimized one. We anticipate that this method will facilitate the construction of accurate, precise, and sufficiently simple models for diverse complex systems.

        <tr id="Our current understanding of fluctuations of dynamical (time-integrated) observables in non- Markovian processes is still very limited. A major obstacle is the lack of an appropriate theoretical framework to evaluate the associated large deviation functions. In this paper we bypass this difficulty in the case of linear diffusions with time delay by using a Markovian embedding procedure that introduces an infinite set of coupled differential equations. We then show that the generating functions of current-type observables can be computed at arbitrary finite time by solving matrix Riccati differential equations (RDEs) somewhat similar to those encountered in optimal control and filtering problems. By exploring in detail the properties of these RDEs and of the corresponding continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs), we identify the generic fixed point towards which the solutions converge in the long-time limit. This allows us to derive the explicit expressions of the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), of the pre-exponential factors, and of the effective (or driven) process that describes how fluctuations are created dynamically. Finally, we describe the special behavior occurring at the limits of the domain of existence of the SCGF, in connection with fluctuation relations for the heat and the entropy production.">

We analyze the convergence properties and establish the error bounds of this method for two types of PDEs: parabolic (exemplified by the heat and Burgers' equations) and hyperbolic (exemplified by the wave and nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations). We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation. Ample numerical experiments are presented based on the proposed algorithm to validate the effectiveness of this method and confirm aspects of the theoretical analyses.">

        <tr id="Parameter identifiability is an important aspect of parameter estimation of dynamic system modelling. Several methods exist to determine identifiability of parameter sets using the model definition and analysis of experimental data. There is also the possibility of some parameters being independently unidentifiable but forming identifiable parameter combinations. These identifiable parameter combinations are useful in model reparameterisation to estimate parameters experimentally. Multiple numerical and algebraic methods exist to detect identifiable parameter combinations of dynamic system models represented as ordinary differential equations (ODE). Local identifiability analysis of hybrid system models are available in the literature. However, methods for structural identifiability analysis and identifiable combination detection for hybrid systems are not explored. Here, we have developed a parameter identifiable combination detection method for non-linear hybrid systems along with ODE systems using an SMT based parameter space exploration method. For higher dimensional systems and larger parameter space, SMT based approaches may easily become computationally intractable. This problem has been mitigated to a large extent by heuristically limiting the parameter space to be explored, using Gaussian process regression and gradient based approaches. The developed method has been demonstrated for some simple hybrid models, biochemical models of ODE systems and non-linear hybrid systems.">

The proposed model builds on existing research by formulating a non-linear coupled fractional boundary value problem with mixed boundary conditions. The primary advantages of our method include its ability to capture the dynamics of complex systems more accurately and its flexibility in handling different types of fractional derivatives. The model’s solution was derived using advanced mathematical techniques, and the results confirmed the existence and uniqueness of the solutions. This approach not only generalizes classical differential equation methods but also offers a robust framework for modeling real-world phenomena governed by fractional dynamics.

        <tr id="Machine learning has been proposed as an alternative to theoretical modeling when dealing with complex problems in biological physics. However, in this perspective, we argue that a more successful approach is a proper combination of these two methodologies. We discuss how ideas coming from physical modeling neuronal processing led to early formulations of computational neural networks, e.g., Hopfield networks. We then show how modern learning approaches like Potts models, Boltzmann machines, and the transformer architecture are related to each other, specifically, through a shared energy representation. We summarize recent efforts to establish these connections and provide examples on how each of these formulations integrating physical modeling and machine learning have been successful in tackling recent problems in biomolecular structure, dynamics, function, evolution, and design. Instances include protein structure prediction; improvement in computational complexity and accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations; better inference of the effects of mutations in proteins leading to improved evolutionary modeling and finally how machine learning is revolutionizing protein engineering and design. Going beyond naturally existing protein sequences, a connection to protein design is discussed where synthetic sequences are able to fold to naturally occurring motifs driven by a model rooted in physical principles. We show that this model is "learnable" and propose its future use in the generation of unique sequences that can fold into a target structure.">

Consequently, the functioning of EMAs is destined to become critical for the safe and reliable operation of aircraft. Abnormal conditions of the mechanical components of EMAs can lead to their failure. The objective of this work is to develop a method for the early detection of abnormal conditions of the components of EMAs. The proposed method is based on a signal reconstruction model that estimates the motor position of EMA as expected in normal conditions of its components. Then, the presence of an abnormal condition is identified when the difference between the motor position and its reconstructed position in normal conditions exceeds a preset threshold. The signal reconstruction model employs a Physics-Informed Long Short-Term Memory network (PILSTM), whose architecture combines a physics-informed cell for the solution of the differential equations governing the EMA operation, and a data-driven Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell which receives in input the output of the physics-informed cell and reconstructs the position expected in normal conditions. The proposed method is applied to data simulated by a high-fidelity model of EMAs. The results show that PILSTM is able to provide accurate, physics-consistent estimates of the motor position of EMA in normal conditions and the missed and false detection alarms are lower than those of other state-of-the-art methods.">

Many recent advancements in reservoir computing, in particular quantum reservoir computing, make use of reservoirs that are inherently stochastic. However, the theoretical justification for using these systems has not yet been well established. In this paper, we investigate the universality of stochastic reservoir computers, in which we use a stochastic system for reservoir computing using the probabilities of each reservoir state as the readout instead of the states themselves. In stochastic reservoir computing, the number of distinct states of the entire reservoir computer can potentially scale exponentially with the size of the reservoir hardware, offering the advantage of compact device size. We prove that classes of stochastic echo state networks, and therefore the class of all stochastic reservoir computers, are universal approximating classes. We also investigate the performance of two practical examples of stochastic reservoir computers in classification and chaotic time series prediction. While shot noise is a limiting factor in the performance of stochastic reservoir computing, we show significantly improved performance compared to a deterministic reservoir computer with similar hardware in cases where the effects of noise are small.">

Due to its low dimensionality, its analytical and numerical tractability, and its neuronal interpretation, it has been used as a case study to test the performance of different statistical methods in estimating the underlying model parameters. Existing methods, however, often require complete observations, non-degeneracy of the noise or a complex architecture (e.g., to estimate the transition density of the process,"recovering"the unobserved second component), and they may not (satisfactorily) estimate all model parameters simultaneously. Moreover, these studies lack real data applications for the stochastic FHN model. Here, we tackle all challenges (non-globally Lipschitz drift, non-explicit solution, lack of available transition density, degeneracy of the noise, and partial observations) via an intuitive and easy-to-implement sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm. The proposed method relies on a recent computationally efficient and structure-preserving numerical splitting scheme for synthetic data generation, and on summary statistics exploiting the structural properties of the process. We succeed in estimating all model parameters from simulated data and, more remarkably, real action potential data of rats.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are emerging as a promising artificial intelligence approach for solving complex two-phase flow simulations. A critical challenge in these simulations is an accurate representation of the gas–liquid interface using interface tracking methods. While numerous studies in conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have addressed this issue, there remains a notable absence of research within the context of PINNs-based two-phase flow simulations. Therefore, this study aims to develop a robust and generic PINNs for two-phase flow by incorporating the governing equations with three advanced interface tracking methods—specifically, the Volume of Fluid, Level Set, and Phase-Field method—into an improved PINN framework that has been previously proposed and validated. To further enhance the performance of the PINNs in simulating two-phase flow, the phase field constraints, residual connection and the time divide-and-conquer strategies are employed for restricting neural network training within the scope of physical laws. This self-adaptive and time divide-and-conquer (AT) PINNs is then optimized by minimizing both the residual and loss terms of partial differential equation. By incorporating the three different interface tracking methods, it efficiently handles high-order derivative terms and captures the phase interface. The case of single rising bubble in two-phase flow is simulated to validate the robustness and accuracy of the AT PINNs. The simulation's accuracy is evaluated by comparing its performance in terms of velocity, pressure, phase field, center of mass, and rising velocity with that of conventional PINNs and CFD benchmarks.

        <tr id="The study of effective connectivity (EC) is essential in understanding how the brain integrates and responds to various sensory inputs. Model-driven estimation of EC is a powerful approach that requires estimating global and local parameters of a generative model of neural activity. Insights gathered through this process can be used in various applications, such as studying neurodevelopmental disorders. However, accurately determining EC through generative models remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of brain dynamics and the inherent noise in neural recordings, e.g., in electroencephalography (EEG). Current model-driven methods to study EC are computationally complex and cannot scale to all brain regions as required by whole-brain analyses. To facilitate EC assessment, an inference algorithm must exhibit reliable prediction of parameters in the presence of noise. Further, the relationship between the model parameters and the neural recordings must be learnable. To progress toward these objectives, we benchmarked the performance of a Bi-LSTM model for parameter inference from the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) simulated EEG under various noise conditions. Additionally, our study explores how the JR-NMM reacts to changes in key biological parameters (i.e., sensitivity analysis) like synaptic gains and time constants, a crucial step in understanding the connection between neural mechanisms and observed brain activity. Our results indicate that we can predict the local JR-NMM parameters from EEG, supporting the feasibility of our deep-learning-based inference approach. In future work, we plan to extend this framework to estimate local and global parameters from real EEG in clinically relevant applications.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we apply the Fourier neural operator (FNO) paradigm to ocean circulation and prediction problems. We aim to show that the complicated non-linear dynamics of an ocean circulation can be captured by a flexible, efficient, and expressive structure of the FNO networks. The machine learning model (FNO3D and the recurrent FNO2D networks) trained by simulated data as well as real data takes spatiotemporal input and predicts future ocean states (sea surface current and sea surface height). For this, the double gyre ocean circulation model driven by stochastic wind stress is considered to represent an ideal ocean circulation. In order to generate the training and test data that exhibits rich spatiotemporal variability, the initial states are perturbed by Gaussian random fields. Experimental results confirm that the trained models yield satisfactory prediction accuracy for both types of FNO models in this case. Second, as the training set, we used the HYCOM reanalysis data in a regional ocean. FNO2D experiments demonstrated that the 5-day input to 5-day prediction yields the averaged root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 5.0 cm/s, 6.7 cm/s, 7.9 cm/s, 8.9 cm/s, and 9.4 cm/s in surface current, calculated consecutively for each day, in a regional ocean circulation of the East/Japan Sea. Similarly, the RMSEs for sea surface height were 2.3 cm, 3.5 cm, 4.2 cm, 4.6 cm, and 4.9 cm, for each day. We also trained the model with 15-day input and 10-day prediction, resulting in comparable performance. Extensive numerical tests show that, once learned, the resolution-free FNO model instantly forecasts the ocean states and can be used as an alternative fast solver in various inference algorithms.">

        <tr id="Stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are the foundation for pricing and hedging financial derivatives. The drift and volatility functions in SDE models are typically chosen to be algebraic functions with a small number (less than 5) parameters which can be calibrated to market data. A more flexible approach is to use neural networks to model the drift and volatility functions, which provides more degrees-of-freedom to match observed market data. Training of models requires optimizing over an SDE, which is computationally challenging. For European options, we develop a fast stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for training the neural network-SDE model. Our SGD algorithm uses two independent SDE paths to obtain an unbiased estimate of the direction of steepest descent. For American options, we optimize over the corresponding Kolmogorov partial differential equation (PDE). The neural network appears as coefficient functions in the PDE. Models are trained on large datasets (many contracts), requiring either large simulations (many Monte Carlo samples for the stock price paths) or large numbers of PDEs (a PDE must be solved for each contract). Numerical results are presented for real market data including S&P 500 index options, S&P 100 index options, and single-stock American options. The neural-network-based SDE models are compared against the Black-Scholes model, the Dupire's local volatility model, and the Heston model. Models are evaluated in terms of how accurate they are at pricing out-of-sample financial derivatives, which is a core task in derivative pricing at financial institutions.">

With the increasingly available multifaceted data, a system can often be characterized across multiple spaces. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain coherence in the dynamics across these diverse spaces. To address this challenge, we introduce Synchronized Optimal Transport (SyncOT), a novel approach to jointly model dynamics that represent the same system through multiple spaces. With given correspondence between the spaces, SyncOT minimizes the aggregated cost of the dynamics induced across all considered spaces. The problem is discretized into a finite-dimensional convex problem using a staggered grid. Primal-dual algorithm-based approaches are then developed to solve the discretized problem. Various numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities and properties of SyncOT and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.">

        <tr id="In this study, we investigate trajectories involving multiple impulses within the framework of a generic spacecraft dynamics. Revisiting the age-old query of"How many impulses?", we present novel manipulations heavily leveraging on the properties ofthe state transition matrix. Surprisingly, we are able to rediscover classical results leading to the introduction of a primer vector, albeit not making use of Pontryagin Maximum Principle as in the original developments by Lawden. Furthermore, our mathematical framework exhibits great flexibility and enables the introduction of what we term a"surrogate primer vector"extending a well known concept widely used in mission design. This enhancement allows to derive new simple optimality conditions that provide insights into the possibility to add and/or move multiple impulsive manoeuvres and improve the overall mass budget. This proves especially valuable in scenarios where a baseline trajectory arc is, for example, limited to a single impulse-an instance where traditional primer vector developments become singular and hinder conclusive outcomes. In demonstrating the practical application of the surrogate primer vector, we examine a specific case involving the four-body dynamics of a spacecraft within an Earth-Moon-Sun system. The system is characterized by the high-precision and differentiable VSOP2013 and ELP2000 ephemerides models. The focal point of our investigation is a reference trajectory representing a return from Mars, utilizing the weak stability boundary (WSB) of the Sun-Earth-Moon system. The trajectory incorporates two consecutive lunar flybys to insert the spacecraft into a lunar distant retrograde orbit (DRO). Conventionally, this trajectory necessitates a single maneuver at the DRO injection point.">

        <tr id="Many problems in Physics and Chemistry are formulated as the minimization of a functional. Therefore, methods for solving these problems typically require differentiating maps whose input and/or output are functions -- commonly referred to as variational differentiation. Such maps are not addressed at the mathematical level by the chain rule, which underlies modern symbolic and algorithmic differentiation (AD) systems. Although there are algorithmic solutions such as tracing and reverse accumulation, they do not provide human readability and introduce strict programming constraints that bottleneck performance, especially in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. In this manuscript, we propose a new computer theoretic model of differentiation by combining the pullback of the $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{C}$ combinators from the combinatory logic. Unlike frameworks based on the chain rule, this model differentiates a minimal complete basis for the space of computable functions. Consequently, the model is capable of analytic backpropagation and variational differentiation while supporting complex numbers. To demonstrate the generality of this approach we build a system named CombDiff, which can differentiate nontrivial variational problems such as Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and multilayer perceptrons.">

Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. The DeepOKAN is used to develop surrogates for different mechanics problems. This approach should pave the way for further improving the performance of neural operators.

        <tr id="Onboard density models are a key aspect of closed-loop guidance systems for hypersonic flight. Traditional approaches model density as a deterministic function of altitude, but a recent drive toward stochastic guidance approaches motivates onboard uncertainty propagation. Existing solutions for efficient uncertainty propagation generally treat density as an exponential function of altitude, but this approach is limited in its ability to capture relevant dispersions. This work models density as a Gaussian random field that is approximated by a Karhunen–Loève expansion, enabling a relatively high-fidelity, finite-dimensional parametric representation. Alternative models are also developed using a variational autoencoder architecture, resulting in greater dimensionality reduction at the expense of analytical description. Normalization schemes are presented and compared by their efficiency in capturing density variability in a limited number of terms, and normalization by reference dynamic pressure is shown to be the most compact approach. The model alternatives are compared both by their approximations of density itself and by their predictions of peak heat flux for dispersed direct-entry and aerocapture trajectories. An extension of this approach for modeling density as a function of multiple independent variables is also presented and demonstrated. Finally, it is shown that the Karhunen–Loève density model can be sequentially updated according to noisy density observations by formulating the problem as a Kalman measurement function.">

Results obtained from numerous simulations with different excitation frequencies and noise amplitudes for the action potential firing show very good agreement with output obtained from well-established models. Furthermore, results from the Mann–Whitney U Test reveal a statistically insignificant difference.

        <tr id="Many cognitive models, including those for predicting the time of future events, can be mapped onto a particular form of neural representation in which activity across a population of neurons is restricted to manifolds that specify the Laplace transform of functions of continuous variables. These populations coding Laplace transform are associated with another population that inverts the transform, approximating the original function. This paper presents a neural circuit that uses continuous attractor dynamics to represent the Laplace transform of a delta function evolving in time. One population places an edge at any location along a 1-D array of neurons; another population places a bump at a location corresponding to the edge. Together these two populations can estimate a Laplace transform of delta functions in time along with an approximate inverse transform. Building the circuit so the edge moves at an appropriate speed enables the network to represent events as a function of log time. Choosing the connections appropriately within the edge network make the network states map onto Laplace transform with exponential change as a function of time. In this paper we model a learned temporal association in which one stimulus predicts another at some fixed delay $T$. Shortly after $t=0$ the first stimulus recedes into the past. The Laplace Neural Manifold representing the past maintains the Laplace transform $\exp(-st)$. Another Laplace Neural Manifold represents the predicted future. At $t=0$, the second stimulus is represented a time $T$ in the future. At each moment between 0 and $T$, firing over the Laplace transform predicting the future changes as $\exp[-s(T-t)]$. Despite exponential growth in firing, the circuit is robust to noise, making it a practical means to implement Laplace Neural Manifolds in populations of neurons for a variety of cognitive models.">

To achieve real-time SEUDO (realSEUDO), we optimize the core estimator via both algorithmic improvements and an fast C-based implementation, and create a new cell finding loop to enable realSEUDO to also identify new cells. We demonstrate comparable performance to offline algorithms (e.g., CNMF), and improved performance over the current on-line approach (OnACID) at speeds of 120 Hz on average.">

        <tr id="Equilibrium propagation is a learning technique conceived for training continuous-time recurrent neural networks. It offers some notable advantages when compared to conventional back-propagation-based algorithms and to classical design methods. From an implementation perspective, it demands only a single computational circuit. Theoretically, although it seeks to minimize a cost function, it exhibits similarities to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), rendering it, to a certain extent, biologically plausible. This paper explores the global dynamic behavior of continuous-time piecewise linear networks trained through equilibrium point propagation. We examine a network in which the target patterns are presented as external inputs rather than as initial conditions. We first show that the learning rules, which extend equilibrium propagation to gradient-like and non-symmetric networks, can be derived as a suitable approximation of Lagrangian optimization. Then, by studying a relatively simple but thoroughly significant case, we demonstrate that a detailed analysis of the equilibrium point distribution yields a profound understanding of the network’s fundamental properties and provides a valuable tool for quantitatively evaluating the network’s accuracy. Compared to classical synthesis techniques, our approach, where patterns are introduced as external inputs, in most cases, circumvents the impractical task of estimating the basins of attraction for sets of multiple equilibrium points. Furthermore, preliminary extensive simulations indicate that the primary dynamic features observed in relatively small networks closely resemble those ensuring the performance and accuracy of large-scale networks.">

The proposed control method incorporates a Universal Self-Learning module, which introduces a model-free online executor-evaluator framework to enable controller adaptation in the presence of unknown disturbances. By leveraging a neural network model trained on historical system performance data, the controller can autonomously learn to approximate optimal performance during each learning cycle. Consequently, the controller's structural parameters are incrementally adjusted to achieve a performance threshold comparable to human-level performance. Utilizing nonlinear system stability theory, specifically in the context of three-dimensional manifold space, we demonstrate the stability of USLC in Lipschitz continuous systems. We illustrate the USLC framework numerically with two case studies: a low-order circuit system and a high-order morphing fixed-wing attitude control system. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and universality of the proposed method.">

In contrast to linear systems, we show that the measurement of all sinks is necessary and sufficient for the identifiability of directed acyclic graphs, under the assumption that dynamics are described by analytic functions without constant terms (i.e., $f(0)=0$). But if constant terms are present, then the identifiability is impossible as soon as one node has more than one in-neighbor. In the case of general digraphs where cycles can exist, we consider additively separable functions for the analysis of the identifiability, and we show that the measurement of one node of all the sinks of the condensation digraph is necessary and sufficient.

Lavenant et al. arXiv:2102.09204 addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure. Chizat et al. arXiv:2205.07146 then provided a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the overwhelming success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce PO-MFL to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees by extending the results of arXiv:2102.09204 to the partially observed setting. We leverage the MFL framework of arXiv:2205.07146, yielding an algorithm based on entropic OT between dynamics-adjusted adjacent time marginals. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free method of arXiv:2205.07146 in key scenarios.">

These problems are crucial in areas such as economics, physics, and biology. We consider the non-local setting, where the interactions between agents are governed by a suitable kernel. For $N$ agents, the interaction cost has $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity, which can be prohibitively slow to evaluate and differentiate when $N$ is large. To this end, we propose an efficient primal-dual algorithm that utilizes basis expansions of the kernels. The basis expansions reduce the cost of computing the interactions, while the primal-dual methodology decouples the agents at the expense of solving for a moderate number of dual variables. We also demonstrate that our approach can further be structured in a multi-resolution manner, where we estimate optimal dual variables using a moderate $N$ and solve decoupled trajectory optimization problems for large $N$. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on an optimal control of 5000 interacting quadrotors.">

        <tr id="Optimal control of multiple heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning units in an open-plan space demands fast and accurate thermodynamic modeling. While computational fluid dynamics is precise, it is computationally impractical for real-time control. Lumped thermal models divide the room into cells and explicitly model inter-cell air-mixing. However, solving the coupled differential equations is still computationally challenging. Data-driven methods like long-short term memory may handle non-linear thermal dynamics but face limitations in observability, adherence to physical constraints, and generalization. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) impose physical constraints even while learning from data. However, PINNs still lack the scalability required for effective control in large open-plan offices, primarily due to air-mixing interactions Our approach, PhyGICS, combines graph neural networks with physics-informed learning (PI-GNN) to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we model the thermodynamic interactions as edges between nodes that represent cells. Further, the modeling approach allows explicit modeling of wall and window surface temperatures that are commonly ignored. PhyGICS, utilizing PI-GNN as a state-estimator, employs a receding-horizon approach for optimal HVAC control. We adapt PI-GNNs for building HVAC control by incorporating a time-resetting strategy to handle time-dependent ambient conditions and therefore set-points. Evaluations in a simulated environment with real-world data show PhyGICS outperforms a regular PINN model and other baseline control strategies on: 1) thermal model accuracy; 2) computation time; 3) energy consumption; and 4) user comfort.">

        <tr id="We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ where $n$ is the state space dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the $n$-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than $n$. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.">

Construction of novel chemical systems with such finely-tuned dynamics is a challenging problem central to the growing field of synthetic biology. In this paper, we address this problem by putting forward a molecular version of a recurrent artificial neural network, which we call a recurrent neural chemical reaction network (RNCRN). We prove that the RNCRN, with sufficiently many auxiliary chemical species and suitable fast reactions, can be systematically trained to achieve any dynamics. This approximation ability is shown to hold independent of the initial conditions for the auxiliary species, making the RNCRN more experimentally feasible. To demonstrate the results, we present a number of relatively simple RNCRNs trained to display a variety of biologically-important dynamical features.">

        <tr id="Graphs serve as generic tools to encode the underlying relational structure of data. Often this graph is not given, and so the task of inferring it from nodal observations becomes important. Traditional approaches formulate a convex inverse problem with a smoothness promoting objective and rely on iterative methods to obtain a solution. In supervised settings where graph labels are available, one can unroll and truncate these iterations into a deep network that is trained end-to-end. Such a network is parameter efficient and inherits inductive bias from the optimization formulation, an appealing aspect for data constrained settings in, e.g., medicine, finance, and the natural sciences. But typically such settings care equally about uncertainty over edge predictions, not just point estimates. Here we introduce novel iterations with independently interpretable parameters, i.e., parameters whose values - independent of other parameters' settings - proportionally influence characteristics of the estimated graph, such as edge sparsity. After unrolling these iterations, prior knowledge over such graph characteristics shape prior distributions over these independently interpretable network parameters to yield a Bayesian neural network (BNN) capable of graph structure learning (GSL) from smooth signal observations. Fast execution and parameter efficiency allow for high-fidelity posterior approximation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and thus uncertainty quantification on edge predictions. Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate this model's ability to provide well-calibrated estimates of uncertainty, in test cases that include unveiling economic sector modular structure from S$\&$P$500$ data and recovering pairwise digit similarities from MNIST images. Overall, this framework enables GSL in modest-scale applications where uncertainty on the data structure is paramount.">

Several training scenarios are investigated across the two different supersonic configurations.

This has received significant attention recently under different types of assumptions on the model parameters. The setting we consider involves a collection of $m$ linear systems each of which resides on a node of a given undirected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$. We assume that the system matrices are marginally stable, and satisfy a smoothness constraint w.r.t $G$ -- akin to the quadratic variation of a signal on a graph. Given access to the states of the nodes over $T$ time points, we then propose two estimators for joint estimation of the system matrices, along with non-asymptotic error bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE). In particular, we show conditions under which the MSE converges to zero as $m$ increases, typically polynomially fast w.r.t $m$. The results hold under mild (i.e., $T \sim \log m$), or sometimes, even no assumption on $T$ (i.e. $T \geq 2$).">

        <tr id="Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time-series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces, for which we prove a universal approximation result. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.">

        <tr id="Kinematic priors have shown to be helpful in boosting generalization and performance in prior work on trajectory forecasting. Specifically, kinematic priors have been applied such that models predict a set of actions instead of future output trajectories. By unrolling predicted trajectories via time integration and models of kinematic dynamics, predicted trajectories are not only kinematically feasible on average but also relate uncertainty from one timestep to the next. With benchmarks supporting prediction of multiple trajectory predictions, deterministic kinematic priors are less and less applicable to current models. We propose a method for integrating probabilistic kinematic priors into modern probabilistic trajectory forecasting architectures. The primary difference between our work and previous techniques is the analytical quantification of variance, or uncertainty, in predicted trajectories. With negligible additional computational overhead, our method can be generalized and easily implemented with any modern probabilistic method that models candidate trajectories as Gaussian distributions. In particular, our method works especially well in unoptimal settings, such as with small datasets or in the presence of noise. Our method achieves up to a 50% performance boost in small dataset settings and up to an 8% performance boost in large-scale learning compared to previous kinematic prediction methods on SOTA trajectory forecasting architectures out-of-the-box, with minimal fine-tuning. In this paper, we show four analytical formulations of probabilistic kinematic priors which can be used for any Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based deep learning models, quantify the error bound on linear approximations applied during trajectory unrolling, and show results to evaluate each formulation in trajectory forecasting.">
