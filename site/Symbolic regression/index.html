        <tr id="Significance Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.">

        <tr id="Significance Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science. The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.">

        <tr id="Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.">

        <tr id="Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.">

        <tr id="Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.">

        <tr id="A key task in the field of modeling and analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems is the recovery of unknown governing equations from measurement data only. There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems (MANDy) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions. The efficiency of the introduced approach will be illustrated with the aid of several high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="First principles modeling of physical systems has led to significant technological advances across all branches of science. For nonlinear systems, however, small modeling errors can lead to significant deviations from the true, measured behavior. Even in mechanical systems, where the equations are assumed to be well-known, there are often model discrepancies corresponding to nonlinear friction, wind resistance, etc. Discovering models for these discrepancies remains an open challenge for many complex systems. In this work, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to discover a model for the discrepancy between a simplified model and measurement data. In particular, we assume that the model mismatch can be sparsely represented in a library of candidate model terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several examples including experimental data from a double pendulum on a cart. We further design and implement a feed-forward controller in simulations, showing improvement with a discrepancy model.">

However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further modification.">

        <tr id="Researchers propose sparse regression for identifying governing partial differential equations for spatiotemporal systems. We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.">

        <tr id="Sparse model identification enables the discovery of nonlinear dynamical systems purely from data; however, this approach is sensitive to noise, especially in the low-data limit. In this work, we leverage the statistical approach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to several synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate substantial improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected from 1900 to 1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be exploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.">

        <tr id="Regularized regression problems are ubiquitous in statistical modeling, signal processing, and machine learning. Sparse regression, in particular, has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: 1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning; 2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations; and 3) the methods apply to composite regularizers, essential for total variation (TV) as well as sparsity-promoting formulations using tight frames. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, and greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. Following standards of reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.">

Library-based sparse regression has emerged as a powerful method for inferring governing equations directly from spatiotemporal data, but current model-agnostic implementations remain computationally expensive, limiting their applicability to data that lack substantial complexity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a scalable framework that enables efficient discovery of complex dynamical models across a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, by ``discovering'' the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) from synthetic data generated by high-resolution simulations of turbulent MHD flows with viscous and Ohmic dissipation. Using a library of candidate terms that is $\gtrsim 10$ times larger than those in previous studies, we accurately recover the full set of MHD equations, including the subtle dissipative terms that are critical to the dynamics of the system. Our results establish sparse regression as a practical tool for uncovering fundamental physical laws from complex, high-dimensional data without assumptions on the underlying symmetry or the form of any governing equation.">

        <tr id="Time-delayed differential equations (TDDEs) are widely used to model complex dynamic systems where future states depend on past states with a delay. However, inferring the underlying TDDEs from observed data remains a challenging problem due to the inherent nonlinearity, uncertainty, and noise in real-world systems. Conventional equation discovery methods often exhibit limitations when dealing with large time delays, relying on deterministic techniques or optimization-based approaches that may struggle with scalability and robustness. In this paper, we present BayTiDe - Bayesian Approach for Discovering Time-Delayed Differential Equations from Data, that is capable of identifying arbitrarily large values of time delay to an accuracy that is directly proportional to the resolution of the data input to it. BayTiDe leverages Bayesian inference combined with a sparsity-promoting discontinuous spike-and-slab prior to accurately identify time-delayed differential equations. The approach accommodates arbitrarily large time delays with accuracy proportional to the input data resolution, while efficiently narrowing the search space to achieve significant computational savings. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of BayTiDe through a range of numerical examples, validating its ability to recover delayed differential equations from noisy data.">

Recently, there has been an explosion of interest surrounding data-driven approaches to weather modeling, which in many cases show improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to traditional methods. However, many of the current data-driven approaches employ highly parameterized neural networks, often resulting in uninterpretable models and limited gains in scientific understanding. In this work, we address the interpretability problem by explicitly discovering partial differential equations governing various weather phenomena, identifying symbolic mathematical models with direct physical interpretations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in particular, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm can learn effective weather models from both simulated and assimilated data. Our approach adapts the standard WSINDy algorithm to work with high-dimensional fluid data of arbitrary spatial dimension.

Machine learning has exhibited great success in learn and predicting dynamical systems from data. However, the fundamental challenges still exist: discovering the exact governing equations from highly noisy data. In the present work, we propose a compressive sensing‐assisted mixed integer optimization (CS‐MIO) method to make a step forward from a modern discrete optimization lens. In particular, we first formulate the problem into a mixed integer optimization model. The discrete optimization nature of the model leads to exact variable selection by means of cardinality constraint, and thereby powerful capability of exact discovery of governing equations from noisy data. Such capability is further enhanced by incorporating compressive sensing and regularization techniques for highly noisy data and high‐dimensional problems. The case studies on classical dynamical systems have shown that CS‐MIO can discover the exact governing equations from large‐noise data, with up to two orders of magnitude larger noise compared with state‐of‐the‐art methods. We also show its effectiveness for high‐dimensional dynamical system identification through the chaotic Lorenz 96 system.">

In this study, evolutionary computing techniques are presented to estimate the governing equations of a dynamical system using time-series data. The main approach is to propose polynomial equations with unknown coefficients, and subsequently perform a parametric estimation using genetic algorithms. Some of the main contributions of the present study are an adequate modification of the genetic algorithm to remove terms with minimal contributions, and a mechanism to escape local optima during the search. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it to three dynamical systems: a linear model, a nonlinear model, and the Lorenz system.

This study explores the capability of a data-driven algorithm, Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), to accurately capture the dynamics of a predator-prey system. We apply SINDy to derive a Learned Model (LM) from data generated by a Reference Model (RM), whose predator-prey dynamics are well understood. The study compares the dynamics of the LM to the RM using criteria such as equilibrium points, stability, sensitivity, and bifurcation analysis. Our results demonstrate general consistency between the RM and LM dynamics, though notable differences remain.

We demonstrate that extended dynamic mode decomposition with dictionary learning (EDMD-DL), when combined with a state space projection, is equivalent to a neural network representation of the nonlinear discrete-time flow map on the state space. We highlight how this projection step introduces nonlinearity into the evolution equations, enabling significantly improved EDMD-DL predictions. With this projection, EDMD-DL leads to a nonlinear dynamical system on the state space, which can be represented in either discrete or continuous time. This system has a natural structure for neural networks, where the state is first expanded into a high dimensional feature space followed by a linear mapping which represents the discrete-time map or the vector field as a linear combination of these features. Inspired by these observations, we implement several variations of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and EDMD-DL, developed by combining different aspects of their respective model structures and training procedures. We evaluate these methods using numerical experiments on chaotic dynamics in the Lorenz system and a nine-mode model of turbulent shear flow, showing comparable performance across methods in terms of short-time trajectory prediction, reconstruction of long-time statistics, and prediction of rare events. We also show that these methods provide comparable performance to a non-Markovian approach in terms of prediction of extreme events.">

        <tr id="Inferring causal networks from noisy observations is of vital importance in various fields. Due to the complexity of system modeling, the way in which universal and feasible inference algorithms are studied is a key challenge for network reconstruction. In this study, without any assumptions, we develop a novel model-free framework to uncover only the direct relationships in networked systems from observations of their nonlinear dynamics. Our proposed methods are termed multiple-order Polynomial Conditional Granger Causality (PCGC) and sparse PCGC (SPCGC). PCGC mainly adopts polynomial functions to approximate the whole system model, which can be used to judge the interactions among nodes through subsequent nonlinear Granger causality analysis. For SPCGC, Lasso optimization is first used for dimension reduction, and then PCGC is executed to obtain the final network. Specifically, the conditional variables are fused in this general, model-free framework regardless of their formulations in the system model, which could effectively reconcile the inference of direct interactions with an indirect influence. Based on many classical dynamical systems, the performances of PCGC and SPCGC are analyzed and verified. Generally, the proposed framework could be quite promising for the provision of certain guidance for data-driven modeling with an unknown model.">

        <tr id="This work presents a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling framework for dynamical systems with spatially localized features characterized by slow singular value decay. The proposed approach builds upon two existing methodologies for reduced and full-order non-intrusive modeling, namely Operator Inference (OpInf) and sparse Full-Order Model (sFOM) inference. We decompose the domain into two complementary subdomains which exhibit fast and slow singular value decay. The dynamics of the subdomain exhibiting slow singular value decay are learned with sFOM while the dynamics with intrinsically low dimensionality on the complementary subdomain are learned with OpInf. The resulting, coupled OpInf-sFOM formulation leverages the computational efficiency of OpInf and the high resolution of sFOM, and thus enables fast non-intrusive predictions for conditions beyond those sampled in the training data set. A novel regularization technique with a closed-form solution based on the Gershgorin disk theorem is introduced to promote stable sFOM and OpInf models. We also provide a data-driven indicator for the subdomain selection and ensure solution smoothness over the interface via a post-processing interpolation step. We evaluate the efficiency of the approach in terms of offline and online speedup through a quantitative, parametric computational cost analysis. We demonstrate the coupled OpInf-sFOM formulation for two test cases: a one-dimensional Burgers' model for which accurate predictions beyond the span of the training snapshots are presented, and a two-dimensional parametric model for the Pine Island Glacier ice thickness dynamics, for which the OpInf-sFOM model achieves an average prediction error on the order of $1 \%$ with an online speedup factor of approximately $8\times$ compared to the numerical simulation.">

        <tr id="System identification, the process of deriving mathematical models of dynamical systems from observed input-output data, has undergone a paradigm shift with the advent of learning-based methods. Addressing the intricate challenges of data-driven discovery in nonlinear dynamical systems, these methods have garnered significant attention. Among them, Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) has emerged as a transformative approach, distilling complex dynamical behaviors into interpretable linear combinations of basis functions. However, SINDy relies on domain-specific expertise to construct its foundational"library"of basis functions, which limits its adaptability and universality. In this work, we introduce a nonlinear system identification framework called LeARN that transcends the need for prior domain knowledge by learning the library of basis functions directly from data. To enhance adaptability to evolving system dynamics under varying noise conditions, we employ a novel meta-learning-based system identification approach that uses a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) to dynamically refine these basis functions. This not only captures intricate system behaviors but also adapts seamlessly to new dynamical regimes. We validate our framework on the Neural Fly dataset, showcasing its robust adaptation and generalization capabilities. Despite its simplicity, our LeARN achieves competitive dynamical error performance compared to SINDy. This work presents a step toward the autonomous discovery of dynamical systems, paving the way for a future where machine learning uncovers the governing principles of complex systems without requiring extensive domain-specific interventions.">

Besides deriving differential equations for dynamical systems based on basic scientific reasoning or prior knowledge in recent times a growing interest emerged to infer these equations purely from data. In this article, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key challenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this problem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least squares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the deviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the integrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we integrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated models and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the different error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization parameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's precision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a wake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a sparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation periods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI example, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent neural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring differential equations that capture potentially causal relationships.">

In this work, we formulate a method to obtain an optimal orthogonal basis of eigen-deformation modes (EDMs) that capture eigenmode variations across a range of parameter values.

The Koopman operator framework has emerged as a powerful tool to address this issue by providing a globally linear perspective on nonlinear dynamics. However, existing methods for approximating the Koopman operator and its spectral components, particularly in large-scale systems, often lack robust theoretical guarantees. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD) introduces a spectral residual measure to assess the convergence of the estimated Koopman spectrum, which helps filter out spurious spectral components. Nevertheless, it depends on pre-computed spectra, thereby inheriting their inaccuracies. To overcome its limitations, we introduce the Neural Network-ResDMD (NN-ResDMD), a method that directly estimates Koopman spectral components by minimizing the spectral residual. By leveraging neural networks, NN-ResDMD automatically identifies the optimal basis functions of the Koopman invariant subspace, eliminating the need for manual selection and improving the reliability of the analysis. Experiments on physical and biological systems demonstrate that NN-ResDMD significantly improves both accuracy and scalability, making it an effective tool for analyzing complex dynamical systems.">

Our framework applies deep neural networks as surrogate models for denoising and reconstructing sparse and noisy observations while using Gaussian-Jacobi quadrature to handle the challenges posed by singularities in fractional derivatives. To optimize both the sparse coefficients and fractional order, we employ an alternating optimization approach that combines sparse regression with global optimization techniques. We validate the framework across various datasets, including synthetic anomalous diffusion data, experimental data on the creep behavior of frozen soils, and single-particle trajectories modeled by L\'{e}vy motion.

The black-box nature of deep learning methods poses difficulties in interpreting the identified model. There is a dire need to interpret the machine learning models to develop a physical understanding of dynamic systems. An interpretable form of neural network called Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) or Multiplicative KAN (MultKAN) offers critical features that help recognize the nonlinearities in the governing ordinary/partial differential equations (ODE/PDE) of various dynamic systems and find their equation structures. In this study, an equation discovery framework is proposed that includes i) sequentially regularized derivatives for denoising (SRDD) algorithm to denoise the measure data to obtain accurate derivatives, ii) KAN to identify the equation structure and suggest relevant nonlinear functions that are used to create a small overcomplete library of functions, and iii) physics-informed spline fitting (PISF) algorithm to filter the excess functions from the library and converge to the correct equation. The framework was tested on the forced Duffing oscillator, Van der Pol oscillator (stiff ODE), Burger's equation, and Bouc-Wen model (coupled ODE). The proposed method converged to the true equation for the first three systems. It provided an approximate model for the Bouc-Wen model that could acceptably capture the hysteresis response.

        <tr id="Data-Driven Response Regime Exploration and Identification (DR2EI) is a novel and fully data-driven method for identifying and classifying response regimes of a dynamical system without requiring human intervention. This approach is a valuable tool for exploring and discovering response regimes in complex dynamical systems, especially when the governing equations and the number of distinct response regimes are unknown, and the system is expensive to sample. Additionally, the method is useful for order reduction, as it can be used to identify the most dominant response regimes of a given dynamical system. DR2EI utilizes unsupervised learning algorithms to transform the system's response into an embedding space that facilitates regime classification. An active sequential sampling approach based on Gaussian Process Regression is used to efficiently sample the parameter space, quantify uncertainty, and provide optimal trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. The performance of the DR2EI method was evaluated by analyzing three established dynamical systems: the mathematical pendulum, the Lorenz system, and the Duffing oscillator, and its robustness to noise was validated across a range of noise magnitudes. The method was shown to effectively identify a variety of response regimes with both similar and distinct topological features and frequency content, demonstrating its versatility in capturing a wide range of behaviors. While it may not be possible to guarantee that all possible regimes will be identified, the method provides an automated and efficient means for exploring the parameter space of a dynamical system and identifying its underlying "sufficiently dominant" response regimes without prior knowledge of the system's equations or behavior.">

        <tr id="Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years for identifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an infinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability guarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under conditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge within the existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and Lyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount of data sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively low sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed high-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system transitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov functions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less conservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing methods.">

The first framework integrates a popular neural operator, DeepONet, and a physics-informed neural network to capture the relationship between sparse data and the underlying physics, enabling the accurate discovery of a family of governing equations.

Both frameworks excel in handling limited data and preserving physical consistency. Benchmarking on the Burgers' equation and reaction-diffusion system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving average $L_2$ errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ for hidden physics discovery and absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ for parameter identification.

Such an approach enables better predictions. However, the data-driven enrichment is usually represented by a regression, whose main drawbacks are (i) the difficulty of understanding the subjacent physics and (ii) the risks induced by the data-driven model extrapolation. This paper proposes a procedure enabling the extraction of a differential operator associated with the enrichment provided by the data-driven regression. For that purpose, a sparse Singular Value Decomposition, SVD, is introduced. It is then employed, first, in a full operator representation regularized optimization problem, where sparsity is promoted, leading to a linear programming problem, and then in a tensor decomposition of the operator’s identification procedure. The results show the ability of the method to identify the exact missing operators from the model. The regularized optimization problem was also able to identify the weights of the missing terms with a relative error of about 10% on average, depending on the selected use case.">

However, real-world applications often present challenges such as the unknown dimensionality of the system and limited access to measurements, particularly in partially observed systems.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have made significant strides in modeling dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their generalization capabilities across varying scenarios remain limited. To overcome this limitation, we propose PIDO, a novel physics-informed neural PDE solver designed to generalize effectively across diverse PDE configurations, including varying initial conditions, PDE coefficients, and training time horizons. PIDO exploits the shared underlying structure of dynamical systems with different properties by projecting PDE solutions into a latent space using auto-decoding. It then learns the dynamics of these latent representations, conditioned on the PDE coefficients. Despite its promise, integrating latent dynamics models within a physics-informed framework poses challenges due to the optimization difficulties associated with physics-informed losses. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach that diagnoses and mitigates these issues within the latent space. This strategy employs straightforward yet effective regularization techniques, enhancing both the temporal extrapolation performance and the training stability of PIDO. We validate PIDO on a range of benchmarks, including 1D combined equations and 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we demonstrate the transferability of its learned representations to downstream applications such as long-term integration and inverse problems.">

        <tr id="Continuous monitoring and real-time control of high-dimensional distributed systems are often crucial in applications to ensure a desired physical behavior, without degrading stability and system performances. Traditional feedback control design that relies on full-order models, such as high-dimensional state-space representations or partial differential equations, fails to meet these requirements due to the delay in the control computation, which requires multiple expensive simulations of the physical system. The computational bottleneck is even more severe when considering parametrized systems, as new strategies have to be determined for every new scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time closed-loop control strategy enhanced by nonlinear non-intrusive Deep Learning-based Reduced Order Models (DL-ROMs). Specifically, in the offline phase, (i) full-order state-control pairs are generated for different scenarios through the adjoint method, (ii) the essential features relevant for control design are extracted from the snapshots through a combination of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and deep autoencoders, and (iii) the low-dimensional policy bridging latent control and state spaces is approximated with a feedforward neural network. After data generation and neural networks training, the optimal control actions are retrieved in real-time for any observed state and scenario. In addition, the dynamics may be approximated through a cheap surrogate model in order to close the loop at the latent level, thus continuously controlling the system in real-time even when full-order state measurements are missing. The effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of computational speed, accuracy, and robustness against noisy data, is finally assessed on two different high-dimensional optimal transport problems, one of which also involving an underlying fluid flow.">

The method constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the functional form of the Hamiltonian. The resulting ROMs preserve the intrinsic structure of the system, ensuring that the mechanical and physical properties of the system are maintained. In this work, we extend this approach to port-Hamiltonian systems, which generalize Hamiltonian systems by including energy dissipation, external input, and output. Based on snapshots of the system's state and output, together with the information about the functional form of the Hamiltonian, reduced operators are inferred through optimization and are then used to construct data-driven ROMs. To further alleviate the complexity of evaluating nonlinear terms in the ROMs, a hyper-reduction method via discrete empirical interpolation is applied. Accordingly, we derive error estimates for the ROM approximations of the state and output. Finally, we demonstrate the structure preservation, as well as the accuracy of the proposed port-Hamiltonian operator inference framework, through numerical experiments on a linear mass-spring-damper problem and a nonlinear Toda lattice problem.">

Towards developing deep learning models for constrained dynamical systems, we introduce neural port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations (N-PHDAEs), which use neural networks to parametrize unknown terms in both the differential and algebraic components of a port-Hamiltonian DAE. To train these models, we propose an algorithm that uses automatic differentiation to perform index reduction, automatically transforming the neural DAE into an equivalent system of neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), for which established model inference and backpropagation methods exist.

 Characterizing the nonlinear behavior of dynamical systems near the stability boundary is a critical step toward understanding, designing, and controlling systems prone to stability concerns. Traditional methods for bifurcation analysis in both experimental systems and large-dimensional models are often hindered either by the absence of an accurate model or by the analytical complexity involved. This paper presents a novel approach that combines the theoretical frameworks of nonlinear reduced-order modeling and stability analysis in dynamical systems with advanced machine learning techniques to perform bifurcation analysis in dynamical systems. By focusing on a low-dimensional nonlinear invariant manifold, this work proposes a data-driven methodology that simplifies the process of bifurcation analysis in dynamical systems. The core of our approach lies in utilizing carefully designed neural networks to identify nonlinear transformations that map observation space into reduced manifold coordinates in its normal form where bifurcation analysis can be performed. The unique integration of analytical and data-driven approaches in the proposed method enables the learning of these transformations and the performance of bifurcation analysis with a limited number of trajectories. Therefore, this approach improves bifurcation analysis in model-less experimental systems and cost-sensitive high-fidelity simulations. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated across several examples.">

 This paper introduces a new neural network architecture designed to forecast high-dimensional spatio-temporal data using only sparse measurements. The architecture utilizes a two-stage end-to-end framework that combines neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) models with vision transformers (ViTs). Initially, our approach models the underlying dynamics of complex systems within a low-dimensional space and then reconstructs the corresponding high-dimensional spatial fields. Traditional methods often involve decoding high-dimensional spatial fields before modeling the dynamics, while others use an encoder to transition from high-dimensional observations to a latent space for dynamic modeling. In contrast, our approach directly uses sparse measurements to model the dynamics, bypassing the need for an encoder. This direct approach simplifies the modeling process, reduces computational complexity, and enhances the efficiency and scalability of the method for large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through applications to various spatio-temporal systems, including fluid flows and global weather patterns. Although sparse measurements have limitations, our experiments reveal that they are sufficient to accurately forecast system dynamics over long time horizons. Furthermore, our results indicate that the performance of the proposed method remains robust across different sensor placement strategies, with further improvements as the number of sensors increases. This robustness underscores the flexibility of our architecture, particularly in real-world scenarios where sensor data is often sparse and unevenly distributed.">

        <tr id="Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum and the compass-gait walker.">

        <tr id="The control of legged robots, particularly humanoid and quadruped robots, presents significant challenges due to their high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics. While linear systems can be effectively controlled using methods like Model Predictive Control (MPC), the control of nonlinear systems remains complex. One promising solution is the Koopman Operator, which approximates nonlinear dynamics with a linear model, enabling the use of proven linear control techniques. However, achieving accurate linearization through data-driven methods is difficult due to issues like approximation error, domain shifts, and the limitations of fixed linear state-space representations. These challenges restrict the scalability of Koopman-based approaches. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a continual learning algorithm designed to iteratively refine Koopman dynamics for high-dimensional legged robots. The key idea is to progressively expand the dataset and latent space dimension, enabling the learned Koopman dynamics to converge towards accurate approximations of the true system dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that the linear approximation error of our method converges monotonically. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high control performance on robots like Unitree G1/H1/A1/Go2 and ANYmal D, across various terrains using simple linear MPC controllers. This work is the first to successfully apply linearized Koopman dynamics for locomotion control of high-dimensional legged robots, enabling a scalable model-based control solution.">

        <tr id="Anticipating a tipping point, a transition from one stable steady state to another, is a problem of broad relevance due to the ubiquity of the phenomenon in diverse fields. The steady-state nature of the dynamics about a tipping point makes its prediction significantly more challenging than predicting other types of critical transitions from oscillatory or chaotic dynamics. Exploiting the benefits of noise, we develop a general data-driven and machine-learning approach to predicting potential future tipping in nonautonomous dynamical systems and validate the framework using examples from different fields. As an application, we address the problem of predicting the potential collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, possibly driven by climate-induced changes in the freshwater input to the North Atlantic. Our predictions based on synthetic and currently available empirical data place a potential collapse window spanning from 2040 to 2065, in consistency with the results in the current literature.

The Galerkin residual method is employed to find an approximate solution to the invariance equation using a Newton iteration on the coefficients of a monomial basis expansion of the solution. These solutions to the invariance equations can then be used to construct reduced-order models. We assess the ability of the method to solve the invariance PDE system as well as to achieve moment matching and recover a system's steady-state behaviour for linear and nonlinear signal generators with system dynamics up to $n=1000$ dimensions.">

        <tr id="Most model reduction methods are space-only in that they reduce the spatial dimension of the solution but not the temporal one. These methods integrate an encoding of the state of the nonlinear dynamical system forward in time. We propose a space-time method -- one that solves a system of algebraic equations for the encoding of the trajectory, i.e., the solution on a time interval $[0,T]$. The benefit of this approach is that with the same total number of degrees of freedom, a space-time encoding can leverage spatiotemporal correlations to represent the trajectory far more accurately than a space-only one. We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes, a spatial basis at each temporal frequency tailored to the structures that appear at that frequency, to represent the trajectory. These modes have a number of properties that make them an ideal choice for space-time model reduction. We derive an algebraic system involving the SPOD coefficients that represent the solution, as well as the initial condition and the forcing. The online phase of the method consists of solving this system for the SPOD coefficients given the initial condition and forcing. We test the model on a Ginzburg-Landau system, a $1 + 1$ dimensional nonlinear PDE. We find that the proposed method is $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude more accurate than POD-Galerkin at the same number of modes and CPU time for all of our tests. In fact, the method is substantially more accurate even than the projection of the solution onto the POD modes, which is a lower bound for the error of any space-only Petrov-Galerkin method.">

        <tr id="A computed approximation of the solution operator to a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) is needed in various areas of science and engineering. Neural operators have been shown to be quite effective at predicting these solution generators after training on high-fidelity ground truth data (e.g. numerical simulations). However, in order to generalize well to unseen spatial domains, neural operators must be trained on an extensive amount of geometrically varying data samples that may not be feasible to acquire or simulate in certain contexts (e.g., patient-specific medical data, large-scale computationally intensive simulations.) We propose that in order to learn a PDE solution operator that can generalize across multiple domains without needing to sample enough data expressive enough for all possible geometries, we can train instead a latent neural operator on just a few ground truth solution fields diffeomorphically mapped from different geometric/spatial domains to a fixed reference configuration. Furthermore, the form of the solutions is dependent on the choice of mapping to and from the reference domain. We emphasize that preserving properties of the differential operator when constructing these mappings can significantly reduce the data requirement for achieving an accurate model due to the regularity of the solution fields that the latent neural operator is training on. We provide motivating numerical experimentation that demonstrates an extreme case of this consideration by exploiting the conformal invariance of the Laplacian">

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for practical identifiability analysis to evaluate parameter identifiability in mathematical models of biological systems. Starting with a rigorous mathematical definition of practical identifiability, we demonstrate its equivalence to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix. Our framework establishes the relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability, introducing a novel metric that simplifies and accelerates the evaluation of parameter identifiability compared to the profile likelihood method. Additionally, we introduce new regularization terms to address non-identifiable parameters, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. To guide experimental design, we present an optimal data collection algorithm that ensures all model parameters are practically identifiable. Applications to Hill functions, neural networks, and dynamic biological models demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed computational framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.">

We then use the contractive properties of the Picard operator to propose a class of gradient-contractive algorithms and provide conditions under which such algorithms are guaranteed to converge to a local optima. The algorithms are then tested on a battery of models and variety of datasets in order to demonstrate robustness and improvement over alternative approaches.">

        <tr id="This paper develops a methodology for adaptive data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) using Koopman operators. While MPC is ubiquitous in various fields of engineering, the controller performance can deteriorate if the modeling error between the control model and the true dynamics persists, which may often be the case with complex nonlinear dynamics. Adaptive MPC techniques learn models online such that the controller can compensate for the modeling error by incorporating newly available data. We utilize the Koopman operator framework to formulate an adaptive MPC technique that corrects for model discrepancies in a computationally efficient manner by virtue of convex optimization. With the use of neural networks to learn embedding spaces, Koopman operator models enable accurate dynamics modeling. Such complex model forms, however, often lead to unstable online learning. To this end, the proposed method utilizes the soft update of target networks, a technique used in stabilization of model learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Also, we provide a discussion on which parameters to be chosen as online updated parameters based on a specific description of linear embedding models. Numerical simulations on a canonical nonlinear dynamical system show that the proposed method performs favorably compared to other data-driven MPC methods while achieving superior computational efficiency through the utilization of Koopman operators.">
