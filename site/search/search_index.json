First, we propose, for use in high-noise settings, an extensive toolkit of critically enabling extensions for the SINDy regression method, to progressively cull functionals from an over-complete library and yield a set of sparse equations that regress to the derivate  $\\dot { \\boldsymbol {x}}$ . This toolkit includes: (regression step) weight timepoints based on estimated noise, use ensembles to estimate coefficients, and regress using FFTs; (culling step) leverage linear dependence of functionals, and restore and protect culled functionals based on Figures of Merit (FoMs). In a novel Assessment step, we define FoMs that compare model predictions to the original time-series (i.e.,  ${ \\boldsymbol x}(t)$  rather than  $\\dot { \\boldsymbol {x}}(t)$ ). These innovations can extract sparse governing equations and coefficients from high-noise time-series data (e.g., 300% added noise). For example, it discovers the correct sparse libraries in the Lorenz system, with median coefficient estimate errors equal to 1%\u22123% (for 50% noise), 6%\u22128% (for 100% noise), and 23%\u221225% (for 300% noise). The enabling modules in the toolkit are combined into a single method, but the individual modules can be tactically applied in other equation discovery methods (SINDy or not) to improve results on high-noise data. Second, we propose a technique, applicable to any model discovery method based on  $\\dot { \\boldsymbol x} = { \\boldsymbol f} ({ \\boldsymbol x})$ , to assess the accuracy of a discovered model in the context of non-unique solutions due to noisy data. Currently, this non-uniqueness can obscure a discovered model\u2019s accuracy and thus a discovery method\u2019s effectiveness. We describe a technique that uses linear dependencies among functionals to transform a discovered model into an equivalent form that is closest to the true model, enabling more accurate assessment of a discovered model\u2019s correctness.\"&gt;           visibility_off A Toolkit for Data-Driven Discovery of Governing Equations in High-Noise Regimes              Charles B.

The $\\ell _1$ -loss is less sensitive to outliers in the measurements than the popular  $\\ell _2$-loss, while the nonconvex penalty has the capability of ameliorating the bias problem of the popular convex LASSO penalty and thus can yield more accurate recovery. To solve this nonconvex and nonsmooth minimization formulation efficiently, we propose a first-order algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers. A smoothing strategy on the $\\ell _1$ -loss function has been used in deriving the new algorithm to make it convergent. Further, a sufficient condition for the convergence of the new algorithm has been provided for generalized nonconvex regularization. In comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms, the new algorithm showed better performance in numerical experiments in recovering sparse signals and compressible images. The new algorithm scales well for large-scale problems, as often encountered in image processing.\"&gt;           visibility_off Efficient and Robust Recovery of Sparse Signal and Image Using Generalized Nonconvex Regularization              Fei Wen, L.
