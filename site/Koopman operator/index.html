        <tr id="A majority of methods from dynamical system analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincaré's geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states." While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept, we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.">

        <tr id="In this work, we explore finite-dimensional linear representations of nonlinear dynamical systems by restricting the Koopman operator to an invariant subspace spanned by specially chosen observable functions. The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that evolves functions of the state of a dynamical system. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the state variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too restrictive for nonlinear systems. Choosing the right nonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is possible to obtain linear reduced-order models, especially those that are useful for control, is an open challenge. Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis that enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems. First, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the observable subspace, as in DMD. However, we find that this is only possible when there is a single isolated fixed point, as systems with multiple fixed points or more complicated attractors are not globally topologically conjugate to a finite-dimensional linear system, and cannot be represented by a finite-dimensional linear Koopman subspace that includes the state. We then present a data-driven strategy to identify relevant observable functions for Koopman analysis by leveraging a new algorithm to determine relevant terms in a dynamical system by ℓ1-regularized regression of the data in a nonlinear function space; we also show how this algorithm is related to DMD. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of nonlinear observable subspaces in the design of Koopman operator optimal control laws for fully nonlinear systems using techniques from linear optimal control.">

        <tr id="We develop a deep autoencoder architecture that can be used to find a coordinate transformation which turns a non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) into a linear PDE. Our architecture is motivated by the linearising transformations provided by the Cole–Hopf transform for Burgers’ equation and the inverse scattering transform for completely integrable PDEs. By leveraging a residual network architecture, a near-identity transformation can be exploited to encode intrinsic coordinates in which the dynamics are linear. The resulting dynamics are given by a Koopman operator matrix K. The decoder allows us to transform back to the original coordinates as well. Multiple time step prediction can be performed by repeated multiplication by the matrix K in the intrinsic coordinates. We demonstrate our method on a number of examples, including the heat equation and Burgers’ equation, as well as the substantially more challenging Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, showing that our method provides a robust architecture for discovering linearising transforms for non-linear PDEs.">

        <tr id="We propose spectral methods for long-term forecasting of temporal signals stemming from linear and nonlinear quasi-periodic dynamical systems. For linear signals, we introduce an algorithm with similarities to the Fourier transform but which does not rely on periodicity assumptions, allowing for forecasting given potentially arbitrary sampling intervals. We then extend this algorithm to handle nonlinearities by leveraging Koopman theory. The resulting algorithm performs a spectral decomposition in a nonlinear, data-dependent basis. The optimization objective for both algorithms is highly non-convex. However, expressing the objective in the frequency domain allows us to compute global optima of the error surface in a scalable and efficient manner, partially by exploiting the computational properties of the Fast Fourier Transform. Because of their close relation to Bayesian Spectral Analysis, uncertainty quantification metrics are a natural byproduct of the spectral forecasting methods. We extensively benchmark these algorithms against other leading forecasting methods on a range of synthetic experiments as well as in the context of real-world power systems and fluid flows.">

        <tr id="The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science. First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator theoretic or probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due primarily to three key factors: 1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems, 2) the approach is formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big-data and machine learning techniques, and 3) simple, yet powerful numerical algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications. In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory, describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and its variants, such as extended DMD (EDMD), are broadly used to fit simple linear models to dynamical systems known from observable data. As DMD methods work well in several situations but perform poorly in others, a clarification of the assumptions under which DMD is applicable is desirable. Upon closer inspection, existing interpretations of DMD methods based on the Koopman operator are not quite satisfactory: they justify DMD under assumptions that hold only with probability zero for generic observables. Here, we give a justification for DMD as a local, leading-order reduced model for the dominant system dynamics under conditions that hold with probability one for generic observables and non-degenerate observational data. We achieve this for autonomous and for periodically forced systems of finite or infinite dimensions by constructing linearizing transformations for their dominant dynamics within attracting slow spectral submanifolds (SSMs). Our arguments also lead to a new algorithm, data-driven linearization (DDL), which is a higher-order, systematic linearization of the observable dynamics within slow SSMs. We show by examples how DDL outperforms DMD and EDMD on numerical and experimental data.">

        <tr id="Dynamical systems provide a comprehensive way to study complex and changing behaviors across various sciences. Many modern systems are too complicated to analyze directly or we do not have access to models, driving significant interest in learning methods. Koopman operators have emerged as a dominant approach because they allow the study of nonlinear dynamics using linear techniques by solving an infinite-dimensional spectral problem. However, current algorithms face challenges such as lack of convergence, hindering practical progress. This paper addresses a fundamental open question: \textit{When can we robustly learn the spectral properties of Koopman operators from trajectory data of dynamical systems, and when can we not?} Understanding these boundaries is crucial for analysis, applications, and designing algorithms. We establish a foundational approach that combines computational analysis and ergodic theory, revealing the first fundamental barriers -- universal for any algorithm -- associated with system geometry and complexity, regardless of data quality and quantity. For instance, we demonstrate well-behaved smooth dynamical systems on tori where non-trivial eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator cannot be determined by any sequence of (even randomized) algorithms, even with unlimited training data. Additionally, we identify when learning is possible and introduce optimal algorithms with verification that overcome issues in standard methods. These results pave the way for a sharp classification theory of data-driven dynamical systems based on how many limits are needed to solve a problem. These limits characterize all previous methods, presenting a unified view. Our framework systematically determines when and how Koopman spectral properties can be learned.">

        <tr id="We aim at developing an EDMD-type algorithm that captures the spectrum of the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of analytic functions. Our method relies on an orthogonal projection on polynomial subspaces, which is equivalent to Taylor approximation in a data-driven setting. In the case of dynamics with a hyperbolic equilibrium, the method demonstrates excellent performance to capture the lattice structured Koopman spectrum based on the eigenvalues of the linearized system at the equilibrium. Moreover, it yields the Taylor approximation of associated principal eigenfunctions. Since the method preserves the triangular structure of the operator, it does not suffer from spectral pollution and, moreover, arbitrary accuracy on the spectrum can be reached with a fixed finite dimension of the approximation.">

However, they often rely on strong modeling assumptions and expensive numerical integration, requiring significant computational resources and domain expertise. While deep learning (DL) provides efficient alternatives for modeling complex dynamics, they require a large amount of labeled training data. Furthermore, its predictions may disobey the governing physical laws and are difficult to interpret. Physics-guided DL aims to integrate first-principled physical knowledge into data-driven methods. It has the best of both worlds and is well equipped to better solve scientific problems. Recently, this field has gained great progress and has drawn considerable interest across discipline Here, we introduce the framework of physics-guided DL with a special emphasis on learning dynamical systems.

        <tr id="Reduced order models are becoming increasingly important for rendering complex and multiscale spatio-temporal dynamics computationally tractable. The computational efficiency of such surrogate models is especially important for design, exhaustive exploration and physical understanding. Plasma simulations, in particular those applied to the study of ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ plasma discharges and technologies, such as Hall thrusters, require substantial computational resources in order to resolve the multidimentional dynamics that span across wide spatial and temporal scales. Although high-fidelity computational tools are available to simulate such systems over limited conditions and in highly simplified geometries, simulations of full-size systems and/or extensive parametric studies over many geometric configurations and under different physical conditions are computationally intractable with conventional numerical tools. Thus, scientific studies and industrially oriented modeling of plasma systems, including the important ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ technologies, stand to significantly benefit from reduced order modeling algorithms. We develop a model reduction scheme based upon a {\em Shallow REcurrent Decoder} (SHRED) architecture. The scheme uses a neural network for encoding limited sensor measurements in time (sequence-to-sequence encoding) to full state-space reconstructions via a decoder network. Based upon the theory of separation of variables, the SHRED architecture is capable of (i) reconstructing full spatio-temporal fields with as little as three point sensors, even the fields that are not measured with sensor feeds but that are in dynamic coupling with the measured field, and (ii) forecasting the future state of the system using neural network roll-outs from the trained time encoding model.">

        <tr id="We introduce a method for constructing reduced-order models directly from videos of dynamical systems. The method uses a non-intrusive tracking to isolate the motion of a user-selected part in the video of an autonomous dynamical system. In the space of delayed observations of this motion, we reconstruct a low-dimensional attracting spectral submanifold (SSM) whose internal dynamics serves as a mathematically justified reduced-order model for nearby motions of the full system. We obtain this model in a simple polynomial form that allows explicit identification of important physical system parameters, such as natural frequencies, linear and nonlinear damping and nonlinear stiffness. Beyond faithfully reproducing attracting steady states and limit cycles, our SSM-reduced models can also uncover hidden motion not seen in the video, such as unstable fixed points and unstable limit cycles forming basin boundaries. We demonstrate all these features on experimental videos of five physical systems: a double pendulum, an inverted flag in counter-flow, water sloshing in tank, a wing exhibiting aeroelastic flutter and a shimmying wheel.">

        <tr id="When neural networks are trained from data to simulate the dynamics of physical systems, they encounter a persistent challenge: the long-time dynamics they produce are often unphysical or unstable. We analyze the origin of such instabilities when learning linear dynamical systems, focusing on the training dynamics. We make several analytical findings which empirical observations suggest extend to nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.">

However, constructing ROMs from noisy high-dimensional data is challenging. In this work, we propose a data-driven, non-intrusive method that utilizes stochastic variational deep kernel learning (SVDKL) to discover low-dimensional latent spaces from data and a recurrent version of SVDKL for representing and predicting the evolution of latent dynamics. The proposed method is demonstrated with two challenging examples -- a double pendulum and a reaction-diffusion system. Results show that our framework is capable of (i) denoising and reconstructing measurements, (ii) learning compact representations of system states, (iii) predicting system evolution in low-dimensional latent spaces, and (iv) quantifying modeling uncertainties.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems, e.g. in climate and engineering sciences, often necessitates solving partial differential equations. Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Stability is a basic requirement when studying the behavior of dynamical systems. However, stabilizing dynamical systems via reinforcement learning is challenging because only little data can be collected over short time horizons before instabilities are triggered and data become meaningless. This work introduces a reinforcement learning approach that is formulated over latent manifolds of unstable dynamics so that stabilizing policies can be trained from few data samples. The unstable manifolds are minimal in the sense that they contain the lowest dimensional dynamics that are necessary for learning policies that guarantee stabilization. This is in stark contrast to generic latent manifolds that aim to approximate all -- stable and unstable -- system dynamics and thus are higher dimensional and often require higher amounts of data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach stabilizes even complex physical systems from few data samples for which other methods that operate either directly in the system state space or on generic latent manifolds fail.">

        <tr id="The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

        <tr id="Given the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in traffic dynamics within vehicular platoons, there exists a critical need for a modeling methodology with high accuracy while concurrently achieving physical analyzability. Currently, there are two predominant approaches: the physics model-based approach and the Artificial Intelligence (AI)--based approach. Knowing the facts that the physical-based model usually lacks sufficient modeling accuracy and potential function mismatches and the pure-AI-based method lacks analyzability, this paper innovatively proposes an AI-based Koopman approach to model the unknown nonlinear platoon dynamics harnessing the power of AI and simultaneously maintain physical analyzability, with a particular focus on periods of traffic oscillation. Specifically, this research first employs a deep learning framework to generate the embedding function that lifts the original space into the embedding space. Given the embedding space descriptiveness, the platoon dynamics can be expressed as a linear dynamical system founded by the Koopman theory. Based on that, the routine of linear dynamical system analysis can be conducted on the learned traffic linear dynamics in the embedding space. By that, the physical interpretability and analyzability of model-based methods with the heightened precision inherent in data-driven approaches can be synergized. Comparative experiments have been conducted with existing modeling approaches, which suggests our method's superiority in accuracy. Additionally, a phase plane analysis is performed, further evidencing our approach's effectiveness in replicating the complex dynamic patterns. Moreover, the proposed methodology is proven to feature the capability of analyzing the stability, attesting to the physical analyzability.">

        <tr id="Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.">

        <tr id="Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time-series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces, for which we prove a universal approximation result. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.">

        <tr id="Reduced order modeling lowers the computational cost of solving PDEs by learning a low-order spatial representation from data and dynamically evolving these representations using manifold projections of the governing equations. While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. Numerical experiments reveal that SNF-ROM is able to accelerate the full-order computation by up to $199\times$. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.">

        <tr id="This study presents the extension of the data-driven optimal prediction approach to the dynamical system with control. The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction. We experimentally confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for two Hamiltonian dynamical systems.">

The majority of dynamical systems arising from applications show a chaotic character. This is especially true for climate and weather applications. We present here an application of Koopman operator theory to tropical and global SST that yields an approximation to the continuous spectrum typical of these situations. We also show that the Koopman modes yield a decomposition of the data sets that can be used to categorize the variability. Most relevant modes emerge naturally and they can be identified easily. A difference with other analysis methods such as EOF or Fourier expansion is that the Koopman modes have a dynamical interpretation thanks to their connection to the Koopman operator and they are not constrained in their shape by special requirements such as orthogonality (as it is the case for EOF) or pure periodicity (as in the case of Fourier expansions). The pure periodic modes emerge naturally and they form a subspace that can be interpreted as the limiting subspace for the variability. The stationary states therefore are the scaffolding around which the dynamics takes place. The modes can also be traced to the NINO variability and in the case of the global SST to the PDO.">

NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some"optimal"coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.">

Our data-driven methodology simultaneously approximates the PF operator to perform prediction of the evolution of the agents and also predicts the terminal probability density of AI agents, such as robotic systems and generative models.

We compute these quantities for the classes of exponentially-decaying and polynomially-decaying Lipschitz fading-memory systems and show that RNNs can achieve them.">

        <tr id="Enhancing the sparsity of data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) has gained increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we analyze an efficient approach to identifying skillful ROMs with a sparse structure using an information-theoretic indicator called causation entropy. The causation entropy quantifies in a statistical way the additional contribution of each term to the underlying dynamics beyond the information already captured by all the other terms in the ansatz. By doing so, the causation entropy assesses the importance of each term to the dynamics before a parameter estimation procedure is performed. Thus, the approach can be utilized to eliminate terms with little dynamic impact, leading to a parsimonious structure that retains the essential physics. To circumvent the difficulty of estimating high-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) involved in the causation entropy computation, we leverage Gaussian approximations for such PDFs, which are demonstrated to be sufficient even in the presence of highly non-Gaussian dynamics. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by building sparse causation-based ROMs for various purposes, such as recovering long-term statistics and inferring unobserved dynamics via data assimilation with partial observations.">

The basic dynamical mechanism is that inputs to the network generate ongoing activity, which in turn controls how additional inputs or signals propagate spatially or attenuate in time. We present analytical solutions for the steady states when the network is forced with a single oscillation and when a background value creates a steady state of ongoing activity, and derive the relationships shaping the value of the temporal decay and spatial propagation length as a function of this background value.">

This paper introduces a novel, data-driven framework that synergizes physics-based priors with advanced ML techniques to address the computational and practical limitations inherent in first-principle-based methods and brute-force machine learning methods. Our framework showcases four algorithms, each embedding a specific physics-based prior tailored to a particular class of nonlinear systems, including separable and nonseparable Hamiltonian systems, hyperbolic partial differential equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics. The intrinsic incorporation of physical laws preserves the system's intrinsic symmetries and conservation laws, ensuring solutions are physically plausible and computationally efficient. The integration of these priors also enhances the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns typical in physical phenomena that conventional methods often miss. As a result, our models outperform existing data-driven techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, and predictive capability, particularly in recognizing features absent from the training set, despite relying on small datasets, short training periods, and small sample sizes.">

Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

Firstly, we formulate an optimization problem to obtain a linear representation of a nonlinear vector field based on a system's trajectory. We also prove that its cost function is strictly convex, given the trajectory is persistently exciting. Under certain observability conditions, we provide results that guarantee the Hurwitz stability of the global minimizer. Secondly, we present a novel algorithm based on point-wise geometric flows to estimate the boundary of the region of attraction. We show that the algorithm converges to the exact boundary of the region of attraction under certain assumptions on the system dynamics.

        <tr id="Neural operators extend data-driven models to map between infinite-dimensional functional spaces. While these operators perform effectively in either the time or frequency domain, their performance may be limited when applied to non-stationary spatial or temporal signals whose frequency characteristics change with time. Here, we introduce Complex Neural Operator (CoNO) that parameterizes the integral kernel using Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), better representing non-stationary signals in a complex-valued domain. Theoretically, we prove the universal approximation capability of CoNO. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of CoNO on seven challenging partial differential equations (PDEs), including regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds. Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data. Altogether, CoNO presents a robust and superior model for modeling continuous dynamical systems, providing a fillip to scientific machine learning.">

        <tr id="Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

        <tr id="The parametric greedy latent space dynamics identification (gLaSDI) framework has demonstrated promising potential for accurate and efficient modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear physical systems. However, it remains challenging to handle noisy data. To enhance robustness against noise, we incorporate the weak-form estimation of nonlinear dynamics (WENDy) into gLaSDI. In the proposed weak-form gLaSDI (WgLaSDI) framework, an autoencoder and WENDy are trained simultaneously to discover intrinsic nonlinear latent-space dynamics of high-dimensional data. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) employed in gLaSDI, WENDy enables variance reduction and robust latent space discovery, therefore leading to more accurate and efficient reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, the greedy physics-informed active learning in WgLaSDI enables adaptive sampling of optimal training data on the fly for enhanced modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various nonlinear dynamical problems, including viscous and inviscid Burgers' equations, time-dependent radial advection, and the Vlasov equation for plasma physics. With data that contains 5-10% Gaussian white noise, WgLaSDI outperforms gLaSDI by orders of magnitude, achieving 1-7% relative errors. Compared with the high-fidelity models, WgLaSDI achieves 121 to 1,779x speed-up.">

This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we leverage on machine learning via the combination of two data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, to obtain symbolic expressions of quasipotential functions. The key idea is first to determine an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that governs the underlying dynamics using neural networks, then to interpret symbolically the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition. These functions are regressed simultaneously with the addition of mathematical constraints. We show that our approach discovers a parsimonious quasipotential equation for an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential and for the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator. The analytical forms deliver direct access to the stability of the metastable states and predict rare events with significant computational advantages. Our data-driven approach is of interest for a wide range of applications in which to assess the fluctuating dynamics.">

Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

        <tr id="We investigate reduced-order models for acoustic and electromagnetic wave problems in parametrically defined domains. The parameter-to-solution maps are approximated following the so-called Galerkin POD-NN method, which combines the construction of a reduced basis via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with neural networks (NNs). As opposed to the standard reduced basis method, this approach allows for the swift and efficient evaluation of reduced-order solutions for any given parametric input. As is customary in the analysis of problems in random or parametrically defined domains, we start by transporting the formulation to a reference domain. This yields a parameter-dependent variational problem set on parameter-independent functional spaces. In particular, we consider affine-parametric domain transformations characterized by a high-dimensional, possibly countably infinite, parametric input. To keep the number of evaluations of the high-fidelity solutions manageable, we propose using low-discrepancy sequences to sample the parameter space efficiently. Then, we train an NN to learn the coefficients in the reduced representation. This approach completely decouples the offline and online stages of the reduced basis paradigm. Numerical results for the three-dimensional Helmholtz and Maxwell equations confirm the method's accuracy up to a certain barrier and show significant gains in online speed-up compared to the traditional Galerkin POD method.">

        <tr id="Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.">

In contrast to coherent sets, which may freely move about in phase space over time, our technique focuses on families of metastable sets that are quasi-stationary in space. Our straightforward approach extends successful transfer operator methods for almost-invariant sets to time-dependent dynamics and utilises the Ulam scheme for the generator of the transfer operator on a time-expanded domain. The new methodology is illustrated with an idealised fluid flow and with atmospheric velocity data.

        <tr id="Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) addresses the challenge of training predictive models under temporally varying data distributions. Traditional TDG approaches typically focus on domain data collected at fixed, discrete time intervals, which limits their capability to capture the inherent dynamics within continuous-evolving and irregularly-observed temporal domains. To overcome this, this work formalizes the concept of Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), where domain data are derived from continuous times and are collected at arbitrary times. CTDG tackles critical challenges including: 1) Characterizing the continuous dynamics of both data and models, 2) Learning complex high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and 3) Optimizing and controlling the generalization across continuous temporal domains. To address them, we propose a Koopman operator-driven continuous temporal domain generalization (Koodos) framework. We formulate the problem within a continuous dynamic system and leverage the Koopman theory to learn the underlying dynamics; the framework is further enhanced with a comprehensive optimization strategy equipped with analysis and control driven by prior knowledge of the dynamics patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.">

Recently, recurrent switching dynamical systems have been used to tackle the scale and complexity of these data. However, an important challenge remains in providing insights into the existence and structure of recurrent linear dynamics in neural time series data. Here we test a scalable approach to time-varying autoregression with low-rank tensors to recover the recurrent dynamics in stochastic neural mass models with multiple stable attractors. We demonstrate that the sparse representation of time-varying system matrices in terms of temporal modes can recover the attractor structure of simple systems via clustering. We then consider simulations based on a human brain connectivity matrix in high and low global connection strength regimes, and reveal the hierarchical clustering structure of the dynamics. Finally, we explain the impact of the forecast time delay on the estimation of the underlying rank and temporal variability of the time series dynamics. This study illustrates that prediction error minimization is not sufficient to recover meaningful dynamic structure and that it is crucial to account for the three key timescales arising from dynamics, noise processes, and attractor switching.">

The model performance is demonstrated under a prototype model from idealized geophysical flow and passive tracers, which exhibits analytical solutions with representative statistical features. Many attractive properties are found in the trained model in recovering the hidden dynamics using a limited dataset and sparse observation time, showing uniformly high skill with persistent numerical stability in predicting both the trajectory and statistical solutions among different statistical regimes away from the training regime.

To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

        <tr id="Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in Euclidean space with closed-form symbolic solutions has long been a dream for mathematicians. Inspired by deep learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown great promise in numerically solving PDEs. However, since PINNs essentially approximate solutions within the continuous function space, their numerical solutions fall short in both precision and interpretability compared to symbolic solutions. This paper proposes a novel framework: a closed-form \textbf{Sym}bolic framework for \textbf{PDE}s (SymPDE), exploring the use of deep reinforcement learning to directly obtain symbolic solutions for PDEs. SymPDE alleviates the challenges PINNs face in fitting high-frequency and steeply changing functions. To our knowledge, no prior work has implemented this approach. Experiments on solving the Poisson's equation and heat equation in time-independent and spatiotemporal dynamical systems respectively demonstrate that SymPDE can provide accurate closed-form symbolic solutions for various types of PDEs.">

        <tr id="We introduce a method based on Gaussian process regression to identify discrete variational principles from observed solutions of a field theory. The method is based on the data-based identification of a discrete Lagrangian density. It is a geometric machine learning technique in the sense that the variational structure of the true field theory is reflected in the data-driven model by design. We provide a rigorous convergence statement of the method. The proof circumvents challenges posed by the ambiguity of discrete Lagrangian densities in the inverse problem of variational calculus. Moreover, our method can be used to quantify model uncertainty in the equations of motions and any linear observable of the discrete field theory. This is illustrated on the example of the discrete wave equation and Schr\"odinger equation. The article constitutes an extension of our previous article arXiv:2404.19626 for the data-driven identification of (discrete) Lagrangians for variational dynamics from an ode setting to the setting of discrete pdes.">

Namely, the NN first learns the low-frequency features before learning the high-frequency ones. In this study, we rigorously develop a partial differential equation (PDE) that unravels the frequency dynamics of the error for a 2-layer NN in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime. Furthermore, using this insight, we explicitly demonstrate how an appropriate choice of distributions for the initialization weights can eliminate or control the frequency bias. We focus our study on the Fourier Features model, an NN where the first layer has sine and cosine activation functions, with frequencies sampled from a prescribed distribution. In this setup, we experimentally validate our theoretical results and compare the NN dynamics to the solution of the PDE using the finite element method. Finally, we empirically show that the same principle extends to multi-layer NNs.">

We investigate the efficacy and robustness of an extended dynamic mode decomposition (xDMD) algorithm in constructing ROMs of three-dimensional cardiovascular computations. Focusing on the ROMs' accuracy in representation and interpolation, we relate these metrics to the truncation rank of singular value decomposition, which underpins xDMD and other approaches to ROM construction. Our key innovation is to relate the truncation rank to the singular values of the original flow problem. This result establishes a priori guidelines for the xDMD deployment and its likely success as a means of data compression and reconstruction of the system's dynamics from dominant spatiotemporal structures present in the data.">

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

Then, in the prior dimensionality reduced subspace, we correct the inaccurate mode coefficients and restore the discarded mode coefficients through neural network. Finally, we approximate the solutions with these mode coefficients in the prior dimensionality reduced subspace. To reduce the computational cost during the offline training stage, we propose a training data sampling strategy based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD).

Although benefiting from favourable properties of NeFs such as grid-agnosticity and space-time-continuous dynamics modelling, this approach limits the ability to impose known constraints of the PDE on the solutions -- e.g. symmetries or boundary conditions -- in favour of modelling flexibility. Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.">

The proposed KAN-ODEs retain the flexible dynamical system modeling framework of Neural ODEs while leveraging the many benefits of KANs, including faster neural scaling, stronger interpretability, and lower parameter counts when compared against MLPs. We demonstrate these benefits in three test cases: the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, Burgers' equation, and the Fisher-KPP PDE. We showcase the strong performance of parameter-lean KAN-ODE systems generally in reconstructing entire dynamical systems, and also in targeted applications to the inference of a source term in an otherwise known flow field. We additionally demonstrate the interpretability of KAN-ODEs via activation function visualization and symbolic regression of trained results. The successful training of KAN-ODEs and their improved performance when compared to traditional Neural ODEs implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications.">

Among those, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) stands out as a successful method capable of modeling governing equations with a minimal number of terms, utilizing the principles of compressive sensing. This feature, which relies on a small number of terms, is crucial for interpretability. The effectiveness of SINDy hinges on the choice of candidate functions within its dictionary to extract governing equations of dynamical systems. A larger dictionary allows for more terms, enhancing the quality of approximations. However, the computational complexity scales with dictionary size, rendering SINDy less suitable for high-dimensional datasets, even though it has been successfully applied to low-dimensional datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce iterative SINDy in this paper, where the dictionary undergoes expansion and compression through iterations. We also conduct an analysis of the convergence properties of iterative SINDy. Simulation results validate that iterative SINDy can achieve nearly identical performance to SINDy, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Notably, iterative SINDy demonstrates effectiveness with high-dimensional time-series data without incurring the prohibitively high computational cost associated with SINDy.">

The novelty of this approach is that it can control a system's dynamics despite the controller being much slower than the dynamics. We demonstrate this controller on the Lorenz system of equations where it iteratively adjusts (tunes) the system's input parameters to successfully reproduce a desired oscillatory trajectory or state. Additionally, we investigate the system's dynamical sensitivity to its control parameters, identify continuous and bounded regions of desired dynamical trajectories, and demonstrate that the controller is robust to missing information and uncontrollable parameters as long as certain requirements are met.

If $\epsilon$ is too small or too large, then the approximation is inaccurate or completely breaks down. However, an analytic expression for the optimal $\epsilon$ is out of reach. In our work, we use some explicitly solvable models and Monte Carlo simulations to find the approximately optimal range of $\epsilon$ that gives, on average, relatively accurate approximation of the eigenmaps. Numerically we can consider several model situations where eigen-coordinates can be computed analytically, including intervals with uniform and weighted measures, squares, tori, spheres, and the Sierpinski gasket. In broader terms, we intend to study eigen-coordinates on weighted Riemannian manifolds, possibly with boundary, and on some metric measure spaces, such as fractals.">

        <tr id="Time-varying optimization problems are central to many engineering applications, where performance metrics and system constraints evolve dynamically with time. A number of algorithms have been proposed in recent years to solve such problems; a common feature of all these methods is that they implicitly require precise knowledge of the temporal variability of the solutions in order to exactly track the optimizers. In this paper, we seek to lift these stringent assumptions. Our main result is a fundamental characterization, showing that an algorithm can track an optimal trajectory if and only if it contains a model of the temporal variability of the problem. We refer to this concept to as the internal model principle of time-varying optimization. By recasting the optimization objective as a nonlinear regulation problem and using tools from center manifold theory, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions both for an optimization algorithm to achieve exact asymptotic tracking and for such an algorithm to exist. We illustrate the applicability of the approach numerically on both synthetic problems as well as practical problems in transportation.">

Such problems arise in the context of Bayesian inference and recent machine learning-inspired PDE solvers. We give a representer theorem for the conditioned random variable $\xi \mid F\circ \phi(\xi)$, stating that it decomposes as the sum of an infinite-dimensional Gaussian (which is identified analytically) as well as a finite-dimensional non-Gaussian measure. We also introduce a novel notion of the mode of a conditional measure by taking the limit of the natural relaxation of the problem, to which we can apply the existing notion of maximum a posteriori estimators of posterior measures. Finally, we introduce a variant of the Laplace approximation for the efficient simulation of the aforementioned conditioned Gaussian random variables towards uncertainty quantification.">

A potential solution lies in the non-local, distributed computation at the whole-brain level made possible by criticality and amplified by the rare long-range connections found in the brain’s unique anatomical structure. This non-locality can be captured by the mathematical structure of Schrödinger’s wave equation, which is at the heart of the novel CHARM (Complex Harmonics decomposition) framework that performs the necessary dimensional manifold reduction able to extract non-locality in critical spacetime brain dynamics. Using a large neuroimaging dataset of over 1,000 people, CHARM captured the critical, non-local/long-range nature of brain dynamics and the underlying mechanisms were established using a precise whole-brain model. Equally, CHARM revealed the significantly different critical dynamics of wakefulness and sleep. Overall, CHARM is a promising theoretical framework for capturing the low-dimensionality of the complex network dynamics observed in neuroscience and provides evidence that networks of brain regions rather than individual brain regions are the key computational engines of critical brain dynamics.">

        <tr id="This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning (ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems found in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by differential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and hard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and no-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these constraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate algorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply training unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the differential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this approach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models innately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the well-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact) min-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for these infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then provide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are not only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even dominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly, these results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed problems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms used by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical systems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems with embedded optimal control problems.">

Time-informed set (TIS) can provide the heuristic search domain to accelerate their convergence to the time-optimal solution. However, existing TIS approximation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, computational burden, and limited system applicable scope, e.g., linear and polynomial nonlinear systems. To overcome these problems, we propose a method by leveraging deep learning technology, Koopman operator theory, and random set theory. Specifically, we propose a Deep Invertible Koopman operator with control U model named DIKU to predict states forward and backward over a long horizon by modifying the auxiliary network with an invertible neural network. A sampling-based approach, ASKU, performing reachability analysis for the DIKU is developed to approximate the TIS of nonlinear control systems online. Furthermore, we design an online time-informed SKMP using a direct sampling technique to draw uniform random samples in the TIS. Simulation experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing works, approximating TIS in near real-time and achieving superior planning performance in several time-optimal kinodynamic motion planning problems.">

In recent years, kernel-based methods such as Gaussian processes are becoming increasingly important in applications where quantifying uncertainty is of key interest. In settings that involve structured data defined on graphs, meshes, manifolds, or other related spaces, defining kernels with good uncertainty-quantification behavior, and computing their value numerically, is less straightforward than in the Euclidean setting. To address this difficulty, we present GeometricKernels, a software package which implements the geometric analogs of classical Euclidean squared exponential - also known as heat - and Mat\'ern kernels, which are widely-used in settings where uncertainty is of key interest. As a byproduct, we obtain the ability to compute Fourier-feature-type expansions, which are widely used in their own right, on a wide set of geometric spaces. Our implementation supports automatic differentiation in every major current framework simultaneously via a backend-agnostic design. In this companion paper to the package and its documentation, we outline the capabilities of the package and present an illustrated example of its interface.

With the long-term vision to model dynamical systems to which analytical or numerical methods are impossible or difficult to apply, this paper presents a study of modeling system dynamics and predicting responses using the LSTM networks, which have demonstrated excellent capability in predicting single-mode responses in a prior study. However, the LSTM network exhibits difficulties in modeling and predicting multi-mode responses accurately. To resolve the multi-mode issue, this paper presents an approach that obtains an equivalent network consisting of a set of sub-networks learned on isolated modes, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a simulated 2-degree-of-freedom mass-spring-damper system of nonlinear Duffing springs. The second part of the paper is focused on the application of the proposed approach in piezoelectric energy harvesting. Experiments are conducted on a harvester subjected to random base-motion excitation and exhibiting nonlinearity in its multi-mode response. Both the direct and mode-separation LSTM modeling approaches are applied to predict the output voltage given a random base-motion excitation. The mode-separation approach outperforms the direct approach significantly, and yields an excellent match between the actual and predicted responses. Specifically, for a test electrical voltage response of RMS value 0.2241 V, the difference between the actual test and predicted responses by using the mode-separation approach has an RMS value of 0.0504 V, compared to 0.1645 V obtained by using the direct LSTM approach. It is also much lower than the RMS value of 0.1835 V obtained by using the attention-based LSTM network, another comparison method. Leveraging a deep learning strategy, the validated approach opens up opportunities for accurately modeling energy harvesting systems of high complexities and/or strong nonlinearities.">

This translation process leverages recent advances in data-driven control theory, enabling the controller to operate effectively without relying on explicit system models. The proposed framework incorporates a robust methodology for managing system constraints, ensuring that the control actions remain within predefined bounds. By means of time sequences, the controller learns the underlying system dynamics and adapts to changes in real time, providing enhanced performance and reliability. The integration of set-theoretic methods allows for the systematic handling of uncertainties and disturbances, which are common when the trajectory of a nonlinear system is embedded inside a linear trajectory state tube. To validate the effectiveness of our DDMPC framework, we conduct extensive simulations on a nonlinear DC motor system. The results demonstrate significant improvements in control performance, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of our approach compared to traditional model-based MPC techniques.">

This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

Since formulating governing expressions from first principles can be difficult, it is of particular interest to identify expressions for iterated maps given only their data streams. In this work, we consider a modified Symbolic Artificial Neural Network-Trained Expressions (SymANNTEx) architecture for this task, an architecture more expressive than others in the literature. We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented. We show that our modified SymANNTEx model properly identifies single-state maps and achieves moderate success in approximating a dual-state attractor.

We consider for this a class of generalized shallow NNs given by an ensemble of $N$ multi-layer units, jointly trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and possibly symmetry-leveraging (SL) techniques, such as Data Augmentation (DA), Feature Averaging (FA) or Equivariant Architectures (EA). We introduce the notions of weakly and strongly invariant laws (WI and SI) on the parameter space of each single unit, corresponding, respectively, to $G$-invariant distributions, and to distributions supported on parameters fixed by the group action (which encode EA). This allows us to define symmetric models compatible with taking $N\to\infty$ and give an interpretation of the asymptotic dynamics of DA, FA and EA in terms of Wasserstein Gradient Flows describing their MF limits. When activations respect the group action, we show that, for symmetric data, DA, FA and freely-trained models obey the exact same MF dynamic, which stays in the space of WI laws and minimizes therein the population risk. We also give a counterexample to the general attainability of an optimum over SI laws. Despite this, quite remarkably, we show that the set of SI laws is also preserved by the MF dynamics even when freely trained. This sharply contrasts the finite-$N$ setting, in which EAs are generally not preserved by unconstrained SGD. We illustrate the validity of our findings as $N$ gets larger in a teacher-student experimental setting, training a student NN to learn from a WI, SI or arbitrary teacher model through various SL schemes. We last deduce a data-driven heuristic to discover the largest subspace of parameters supporting SI distributions for a problem, that could be used for designing EA with minimal generalization error.">

Whilst numerical methods are higher fidelity, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning methods on the other hand are lower fidelity but provide significant speed-ups. The emergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in fluid dynamics has allowed scientists to directly use PDEs for evaluating loss functions in an unsupervised manner. The downfall of this approach is that the differential form of systems is invalid at regions of shock inherent in hyperbolic PDEs such as the compressible Euler equations. To circumvent this problem we propose a modification to PDE-based PINN losses by using a finite volume-based loss function that incorporates the flux of Godunov-type methods. These Godunov-type methods are also known as approximate Riemann solvers and evaluate intercell fluxes in an entropy-satisfying manner, yielding more physically accurate shocks. Our approach increases fidelity compared to using regularized PDE-based PINN losses, as tested on the 2D Riemann problem.">

In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.">

Both approaches have been investigated in previous works and the goal of this paper is to extend the model to a parametric setting making use of ad-hoc machine learning procedures. More in detail, we investigate different neural networks' architectures, from simple dense feed-forward to Long-Short Term Memory neural networks, in order to find the most suitable model for the re-introduced contributions. We tested the methods on two test cases with different behaviors: the periodic turbulent flow past a circular cylinder and the unsteady turbulent flow in a channel-driven cavity.

        <tr id="Reduced basis methods for approximating the solutions of parameter-dependant partial differential equations (PDEs) are based on learning the structure of the set of solutions - seen as a manifold ${\mathcal S}$ in some functional space - when the parameters vary. This involves investigating the manifold and, in particular, understanding whether it is close to a low-dimensional affine space. This leads to the notion of Kolmogorov $N$-width that consists of evaluating to which extent the best choice of a vectorial space of dimension $N$ approximates ${\mathcal S}$ well enough. If a good approximation of elements in ${\mathcal S}$ can be done with some well-chosen vectorial space of dimension $N$ -- provided $N$ is not too large -- then a ``reduced'' basis can be proposed that leads to a Galerkin type method for the approximation of any element in ${\mathcal S}$. In many cases, however, the Kolmogorov $N$-width is not so small, even if the parameter set lies in a space of small dimension yielding a manifold with small dimension. In terms of complexity reduction, this gap between the small dimension of the manifold and the large Kolmogorov $N$-width can be explained by the fact that the Kolmogorov $N$-width is linear while, in contrast, the dependency in the parameter is, most often, non-linear. There have been many contributions aiming at reconciling these two statements, either based on deterministic or AI approaches. We investigate here further a new paradigm that, in some sense, merges these two aspects: the nonlinear compressive reduced basisapproximation. We focus on a simple multiparameter problem and illustrate rigorously that the complexity associated with the approximation of the solution to the parameter dependant PDE is directly related to the number of parameters rather than the Kolmogorov $N$-width.">

Using a recently developed multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems, we collect the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the measured data and construct a low-rank dictionary tensor in the tensor-train format. A tensor-based linear regression problem is then built, which balances the learning accuracy, model complexity, and computational efficiency. An algebraic expression of the unknown equations can be extracted.

        <tr id="Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

However, the existing formulation to KSVD cannot work with infinite-dimensional feature mappings, the variational objective can be unbounded, and needs further numerical evaluation and exploration towards machine learning. In this work, i) we introduce a new asymmetric learning paradigm based on coupled covariance eigenproblem (CCE) through covariance operators, allowing infinite-dimensional feature maps. The solution to CCE is ultimately obtained from the SVD of the induced asymmetric kernel matrix, providing links to KSVD. ii) Starting from the integral equations corresponding to a pair of coupled adjoint eigenfunctions, we formalize the asymmetric Nystr\"om method through a finite sample approximation to speed up training. iii) We provide the first empirical evaluations verifying the practical utility and benefits of KSVD and compare with methods resorting to symmetrization or linear SVD across multiple tasks.">

        <tr id="The effective inclusion of a priori knowledge when embedding known data in physics‐based models of dynamical systems can ensure that the reconstructed model respects physical principles, while simultaneously improving the accuracy of the solution in the previously unseen regions of state space. This paper presents a physics‐constrained data‐driven discrepancy modeling method that variationally embeds known data in the modeling framework. The hierarchical structure of the method yields fine scale variational equations that facilitate the derivation of residuals which are comprised of the first‐principles theory and sensor‐based data from the dynamical system. The embedding of the sensor data via residual terms leads to discrepancy‐informed closure models that yield a method which is driven not only by boundary and initial conditions, but also by measurements that are taken at only a few observation points in the target system. Specifically, the data‐embedding term serves as residual‐based least‐squares loss function, thus retaining variational consistency. Another important relation arises from the interpretation of the stabilization tensor as a kernel function, thereby incorporating a priori knowledge of the problem and adding computational intelligence to the modeling framework. Numerical test cases show that when known data is taken into account, the data driven variational (DDV) method can correctly predict the system response in the presence of several types of discrepancies. Specifically, the damped solution and correct energy time histories are recovered by including known data in the undamped situation. Morlet wavelet analyses reveal that the surrogate problem with embedded data recovers the fundamental frequency band of the target system. The enhanced stability and accuracy of the DDV method is manifested via reconstructed displacement and velocity fields that yield time histories of strain and kinetic energies which match the target systems. The proposed DDV method also serves as a procedure for restoring eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a deficient dynamical system when known data is taken into account, as shown in the numerical test cases presented here.">

        <tr id="In the context of model-based control of industrial processes, it is a common practice to develop a data-driven linear dynamical model around a specified operating point. However, in applications involving wider operating conditions, representation of the dynamics using a single linear dynamic model is often inadequate, requiring either a nonlinear model or multiple linear models to accommodate the nonlinear behaviour. While the development of the former suffers from the requirements of extensive experiments spanning multiple levels, significant compromise in the nominal product quality and dealing with unmeasured disturbances over wider operating conditions, the latter faces the challenge of model switch scheduling and inadequate description of dynamics for the operating regions in-between. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient approach to obtain a parsimonious nonlinear dynamic model by developing multiple linear models from data at multiple operating points, lifting the data features obtained from individual model simulations to adequately accommodate the underlying nonlinear behaviour and finally, sparse optimization techniques to obtain a parsimonious model. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulation case studies.">

Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed trial-to-trial variability.">

The prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them suitable surrogates for providing design insights. However, only a few NNs can efficiently handle complex engineering scenario predictions. We introduce a new version of the neural operators called DeepOKAN, which utilizes Kolmogorov Arnold networks (KANs) rather than the conventional neural network architectures. Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. RBFs offer good approximation properties and are typically computationally fast. The KAN architecture, combined with RBFs, allows DeepOKANs to represent better intricate relationships between input parameters and output fields, resulting in more accurate predictions across various mechanics problems. Specifically, we evaluate DeepOKAN's performance on several mechanics problems, including 1D sinusoidal waves, 2D orthotropic elasticity, and transient Poisson's problem, consistently achieving lower training losses and more accurate predictions compared to traditional DeepONets. This approach should pave the way for further improving the performance of neural operators.">

        <tr id="Multi-index models -- functions which only depend on the covariates through a non-linear transformation of their projection on a subspace -- are a useful benchmark for investigating feature learning with neural networks. This paper examines the theoretical boundaries of learnability in this hypothesis class, focusing particularly on the minimum sample complexity required for weakly recovering their low-dimensional structure with first-order iterative algorithms, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples is $n=\alpha d$ is proportional to the covariate dimension $d$. Our findings unfold in three parts: (i) first, we identify under which conditions a \textit{trivial subspace} can be learned with a single step of a first-order algorithm for any $\alpha\!>\!0$; (ii) second, in the case where the trivial subspace is empty, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an {\it easy subspace} consisting of directions that can be learned only above a certain sample complexity $\alpha\!>\!\alpha_c$. The critical threshold $\alpha_{c}$ marks the presence of a computational phase transition, in the sense that no efficient iterative algorithm can succeed for $\alpha\!<\!\alpha_c$. In a limited but interesting set of really hard directions -- akin to the parity problem -- $\alpha_c$ is found to diverge. Finally, (iii) we demonstrate that interactions between different directions can result in an intricate hierarchical learning phenomenon, where some directions can be learned sequentially when coupled to easier ones. Our analytical approach is built on the optimality of approximate message-passing algorithms among first-order iterative methods, delineating the fundamental learnability limit across a broad spectrum of algorithms, including neural networks trained with gradient descent.">

End-to-end machine learning approaches to inverse problems typically require constructing sophisticated estimators to achieve the desired accuracy, largely because they need to learn the complex underlying physical model. Here, we discuss an alternative paradigm: by making the physical model auto-differentiable we can construct a neural surrogate to represent the unknown physical quantity sought, while avoiding having to relearn the known physics entirely. We dub this process surrogate training embedded in physics (STEP) and illustrate that it generalizes well and is robust against overfitting and significant noise in the data. We demonstrate how STEP can be applied to perform dynamic kernel deconvolution to analyse resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra and show that surprisingly simple estimator architectures suffice to extract the relevant physical information.">

This has received significant attention recently under different types of assumptions on the model parameters. The setting we consider involves a collection of $m$ linear systems each of which resides on a node of a given undirected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$. We assume that the system matrices are marginally stable, and satisfy a smoothness constraint w.r.t $G$ -- akin to the quadratic variation of a signal on a graph. Given access to the states of the nodes over $T$ time points, we then propose two estimators for joint estimation of the system matrices, along with non-asymptotic error bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE). In particular, we show conditions under which the MSE converges to zero as $m$ increases, typically polynomially fast w.r.t $m$. The results hold under mild (i.e., $T \sim \log m$), or sometimes, even no assumption on $T$ (i.e. $T \geq 2$).">

Yet, kernel methods such as support vector machines (SVMs), Gaussian processes, or conditional kernel mean embeddings (CKMEs) all give excellent performance under sampling schemes that are obviously non-i.i.d., such as when data comes from a dynamical system. We propose the new notion of empirical weak convergence (EWC) as a general assumption explaining such phenomena for kernel methods. It assumes the existence of a random asymptotic data distribution and is a strict weakening of previous assumptions in the field. Our main results then establish consistency of SVMs, kernel mean embeddings, and general Hilbert-space valued empirical expectations with EWC data. Our analysis holds for both finite- and infinite-dimensional outputs, as we extend classical results of statistical learning to the latter case. In particular, it is also applicable to CKMEs. Overall, our results open new classes of processes to statistical learning and can serve as a foundation for a theory of learning beyond i.i.d. and mixing.">

        <tr id="This work proposes a data‐driven state observation algorithm for nonlinear dynamical systems, when the true state trajectory is not measurable and hence the states information needs to be reconstructed from input and output measurements. Such a reduction is formed by kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA), which (i) implicitly maps the available input–output data into a higher‐dimensional feature space, namely the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS); (ii) finds a projection of the past input–output data and a projection of the future input–output data with maximal correlation; and (iii) identifies the projected inputs and outputs, namely the canonical variates, as the observed states. We adopt a least squares support vector machine (LS‐SVM) formulation for KCCA, which imposes regularization on the vectors that specify the projections and is amenable to convex optimization. We prove theoretically that, based on the statistical consistency of KCCA, the observed states determined by the proposed state observer has a guaranteed correlativity with the actual states (when properly transformed). Furthermore, such observed states, when supplemented with the information of succeeding inputs, can be used to predict the succeeding outputs with guaranteed upper bound on the prediction error.

        <tr id="Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems often faces numerous data-related challenges. A fundamental requirement is the existence of a unique set of parameters for a chosen model structure, an issue commonly referred to as identifiability. Although this problem is well studied for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), few studies have focused on the more general class of systems described by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Examples of DAEs include dynamical systems with algebraic equations representing conservation laws or approximating fast dynamics. This work introduces a novel identifiability test for models characterized by nonlinear DAEs. Unlike previous approaches, our test only requires prior knowledge of the system equations and does not need nonlinear transformation, index reduction, or numerical integration of the DAEs. We employed our identifiability analysis across a diverse range of DAE models, illustrating how system identifiability depends on the choices of sensors, experimental conditions, and model structures. Given the added challenges involved in identifying DAEs when compared to ODEs, we anticipate that our findings will have broad applicability and contribute significantly to the development and validation of data-driven methods for DAEs and other structure-preserving models.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

Designing experiments for linear time-invariant systems is well understood and mainly focuses on the power spectrum of the input signal. Performing experiment design for nonlinear system identification on the other hand remains an open challenge as informativity of the data depends both on the frequency-domain content and on the time-domain evolution of the input signal. Furthermore, as nonlinear system identification is much more sensitive to modeling and extrapolation errors, having experiments that explore the considered operation range of interest is of high importance. Hence, this paper focuses on designing space-filling experiments i.e., experiments that cover the full operation range of interest, for nonlinear dynamical systems that can be represented in a state-space form using a broad set of input signals. The presented experiment design approach can straightforwardly be extended to a wider range of system classes (e.g., NARMAX). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated on the experiment design for a nonlinear mass-spring-damper system, using a multisine input signal.">

In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics.

        <tr id="In this work, we propose a set of physics-informed geometric operators (GOs) to enrich the geometric data provided for training surrogate/discriminative models, dimension reduction, and generative models, typically employed for performance prediction, dimension reduction, and creating data-driven parameterisations, respectively. However, as both the input and output streams of these models consist of low-level shape representations, they often fail to capture shape characteristics essential for performance analyses. Therefore, the proposed GOs exploit the differential and integral properties of shapes--accessed through Fourier descriptors, curvature integrals, geometric moments, and their invariants--to infuse high-level intrinsic geometric information and physics into the feature vector used for training, even when employing simple model architectures or low-level parametric descriptions. We showed that for surrogate modelling, along with the inclusion of the notion of physics, GOs enact regularisation to reduce over-fitting and enhance generalisation to new, unseen designs. Furthermore, through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that for dimension reduction and generative models, incorporating the proposed GOs enriches the training data with compact global and local geometric features. This significantly enhances the quality of the resulting latent space, thereby facilitating the generation of valid and diverse designs. Lastly, we also show that GOs can enable learning parametric sensitivities to a great extent. Consequently, these enhancements accelerate the convergence rate of shape optimisers towards optimal solutions.">

        <tr id="Analyzing dynamical data often requires information of the temporal labels, but such information is unavailable in many applications. Recovery of these temporal labels, closely related to the seriation or sequencing problem, becomes crucial in the study. However, challenges arise due to the nonlinear nature of the data and the complexity of the underlying dynamical system, which may be periodic or non-periodic. Additionally, noise within the feature space complicates the theoretical analysis. Our work develops spectral algorithms that leverage manifold learning concepts to recover temporal labels from noisy data. We first construct the graph Laplacian of the data, and then employ the second (and the third) Fiedler vectors to recover temporal labels. This method can be applied to both periodic and aperiodic cases. It also does not require monotone properties on the similarity matrix, which are commonly assumed in existing spectral seriation algorithms. We develop the $\ell_{\infty}$ error of our estimators for the temporal labels and ranking, without assumptions on the eigen-gap. In numerical analysis, our method outperforms spectral seriation algorithms based on a similarity matrix. The performance of our algorithms is further demonstrated on a synthetic biomolecule data example.">

        <tr id="In the central nervous system, sequences of neural activity form trajectories on low dimensional neural manifolds. The neural computation underlying flexible cognition and behavior relies on dynamic control of these structures. For example different tasks or behaviors are represented on different subspaces, requiring fast timescale subspace rotation to move from one behavior to the next. For flexibility in a particular behavior, the neural trajectory must be dynamically controllable within that behaviorally determined subspace. To understand how dynamic control of neural trajectories and their underlying subspaces may be implemented in neural circuits, we first characterized the relationship between features of neural activity sequences and aspects of the low dimensional projection. Based on this, we propose neural mechanisms that can act within local circuits to modulate activity sequences thereby controlling neural trajectories in low dimensional subspaces. In particular, we show that gain modulation and transient synaptic currents control the speed and path of neural trajectories and clustered inhibition determines manifold orientation. Together, these neural mechanisms may enable a substrate for fast timescale computation on neural manifolds.">

First, high-dimensional training data samples will be mapped to a low-dimensional feature space through the principal component analysis (PCA) featuring process. Following that, the feature space is bisected into multiple partitions based on the variation of the Shannon entropy under the maximum entropy (ME) bisecting process. The behavior of subsystems in the prespecified state space partitions will then be approximated using a group of shallow neural networks (SNNs) known as extreme learning machines (ELMs), and then it can further simplify the model by merging the redundant lattices based on their training error performance. The proposed modeling framework can handle high-dimensional dynamical system modeling problems with the advantages of reducing model complexity and improving model performance in training and verification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework, examples of modeling the LASA dataset and an industrial robot are presented.">

JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss, runs at lightspeed, and drastically outperforms other baselines in practice. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals.

However, most progress has focused on proving identifiability results in different settings, and we are not aware of any successful real-world application. At the same time, the field of dynamical systems benefited from deep learning and scaled to countless applications but does not allow parameter identification. In this paper, we draw a clear connection between the two and their key assumptions, allowing us to apply identifiable methods developed in causal representation learning to dynamical systems. At the same time, we can leverage scalable differentiable solvers developed for differential equations to build models that are both identifiable and practical. Overall, we learn explicitly controllable models that isolate the trajectory-specific parameters for further downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution classification or treatment effect estimation. We experiment with a wind simulator with partially known factors of variation. We also apply the resulting model to real-world climate data and successfully answer downstream causal questions in line with existing literature on climate change.">

Moreover, there are legitimate concerns regarding the generalization and reliability of such approaches, as they often overlook inherent physical constraints. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel machine-learning architecture that is highly generalizable and adheres to conservation laws and physical symmetries, thereby ensuring greater reliability. The foundation of this architecture is graph neural networks (GNNs), which are adept at accommodating a variety of shapes and forms. Additionally, we explore the parallels between GNNs and traditional numerical solvers, facilitating a seamless integration of conservative principles and symmetries into machine learning models. Our findings from experiments demonstrate that the model's inclusion of physical laws significantly enhances its generalizability, i.e., no significant accuracy degradation for unseen spatial domains while other models degrade.

The learned representation can be used for downstream machine-learning tasks such as clustering and classification. The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality. We show the competitive performance of our method on real-world time-series data with the baselines and demonstrate its effectiveness for symbolic text modeling and RNA sequence clustering.">

Moreover, it allows us to propose novel numerical methods for solving the transport task and thus sampling from complicated targets without the need for the normalization constant or data samples. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the respective PDE solutions, implying both conceptional and computational advantages. In particular, PINNs allow for simulation- and discretization-free optimization and can be trained very efficiently, leading to significantly better mode coverage in the sampling task compared to alternative methods.

We are able to understand the role played by activation functions in separability. Indeed, we show that all non-polynomial activations, such as ReLU and sigmoid, are equivalent in terms of expressivity, and that they reach maximum discrimination capacity.

Even though we have a general understanding of the fundamental components in the transformer architecture, little is known about how they operate or what are their expected dynamics. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the relationship between attention mechanisms and Hopfield networks, promising to shed light on the statistical physics of transformer networks. However, to date, the dynamical regimes of transformer-like models have not been studied in depth. In this paper, we address this gap by using methods for the study of asymmetric Hopfield networks in nonequilibrium regimes --namely path integral methods over generating functionals, yielding dynamics governed by concurrent mean-field variables. Assuming 1-bit tokens and weights, we derive analytical approximations for the behavior of large self-attention neural networks coupled to a softmax output, which become exact in the large limit size. Our findings reveal nontrivial dynamical phenomena, including nonequilibrium phase transitions associated with chaotic bifurcations, even for very simple configurations with a few encoded features and a very short context window. Finally, we discuss the potential of our analytic approach to improve our understanding of the inner workings of transformer models, potentially reducing computational training costs and enhancing model interpretability.">

The application of the Laplace transform yields a time-independent problem parametrically depending on the Laplace variable. Following the two-phase paradigm of the RB method, firstly in an offline stage we sample the Laplace parameter, compute the full-order or high-fidelity solution, and then resort to a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to extract a basis of reduced dimension. Then, in an online phase, we project the time-dependent problem onto this basis and proceed to solve the evolution problem using any suitable time-stepping method. We prove exponential convergence of the reduced solution computed by the LT-RB method toward the high-fidelity one as the dimension of the reduced space increases. Finally, we present a set of numerical experiments portraying the performance of the method in terms of accuracy and, in particular, speed-up when compared to the full-order model.">

This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.">

In particular, we model DLOs as serial chains of rigid bodies interconnected by passive elastic joints in which interaction forces are predicted by neural networks. The proposed model accurately predicts the motion of an robotically-actuated aluminium rod and an elastic foam cylinder after being trained on only thirty seconds of data.

        <tr id="We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ where $n$ is the state space dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the $n$-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than $n$. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.">

With the increasingly available multifaceted data, a system can often be characterized across multiple spaces. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain coherence in the dynamics across these diverse spaces. To address this challenge, we introduce Synchronized Optimal Transport (SyncOT), a novel approach to jointly model dynamics that represent the same system through multiple spaces. With given correspondence between the spaces, SyncOT minimizes the aggregated cost of the dynamics induced across all considered spaces. The problem is discretized into a finite-dimensional convex problem using a staggered grid. Primal-dual algorithm-based approaches are then developed to solve the discretized problem. Various numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities and properties of SyncOT and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.">

        <tr id="Predictive modeling involving simulation and sensor data at the same time, is a growing challenge in computational science. Even with large-scale finite element models, a mismatch to the sensor data often remains, which can be attributed to different sources of uncertainty. For such a scenario, the statistical finite element method (statFEM) can be used to condition a simulated field on given sensor data. This yields a posterior solution which resembles the data much better and additionally provides consistent estimates of uncertainty, including model misspecification. For frequency or parameter dependent problems, occurring, e.g. in acoustics or electromagnetism, solving the full order model at the frequency grid and conditioning it on data quickly results in a prohibitive computational cost. In this case, the introduction of a surrogate in form of a reduced order model yields much smaller systems of equations. In this paper, we propose a reduced order statFEM framework relying on Krylov-based moment matching. We introduce a data model which explicitly includes the bias induced by the reduced approximation, which is estimated by an inexpensive error indicator. The results of the new statistical reduced order method are compared to the standard statFEM procedure applied to a ROM prior, i.e. without explicitly accounting for the reduced order bias. The proposed method yields better accuracy and faster convergence throughout a given frequency range for different numerical examples.">

For example, classical fully-connected feed-forward NNs fail to approximate continuous functions whose gradient is discontinuous when employing strong formulations like in Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). In this article, we propose the use of regularity-conforming neural networks, where a priori information on the regularity of solutions to PDEs can be employed to construct proper architectures. We illustrate the potential of such architectures via a two-dimensional (2D) transmission problem, where the solution may admit discontinuities in the gradient across interfaces, as well as power-like singularities at certain points. In particular, we formulate the weak transmission problem in a PINNs-like strong formulation with interface and continuity conditions. Such architectures are partially explainable; discontinuities are explicitly described, allowing the introduction of novel terms into the loss function. We demonstrate via several model problems in one and two dimensions the advantages of using regularity-conforming architectures in contrast to classical architectures. The ideas presented in this article easily extend to problems in higher dimensions.">

These surrogates should be learned from runs of both the high-fidelity and low-fidelity codes and be accompanied by error guarantees that are deterministic rather than stochastic. For this purpose, the article advocates a framework tied to a theory focusing on worst-case guarantees, namely Optimal Recovery. The multi-fidelity considerations triggered new theoretical results in three scenarios: the globally optimal estimation of linear functionals, the globally optimal approximation of arbitrary quantities of interest in Hilbert spaces, and their locally optimal approximation, still within Hilbert spaces. The latter scenario boils down to the determination of the Chebyshev center for the intersection of two hyperellipsoids. It is worth noting that the mathematical framework presented here, together with its possible extension, seems to be relevant in several other contexts briefly discussed.">

In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others.">

Yet, their existence and principles for non-Euclidean geometries and momentum-based dynamics remain largely unknown. In this paper, we characterize"all"conservation laws in this general setting. In stark contrast to the case of gradient flows, we prove that the conservation laws for momentum-based dynamics exhibit temporal dependence. Additionally, we often observe a"conservation loss"when transitioning from gradient flow to momentum dynamics. Specifically, for linear networks, our framework allows us to identify all momentum conservation laws, which are less numerous than in the gradient flow case except in sufficiently over-parameterized regimes. With ReLU networks, no conservation law remains. This phenomenon also manifests in non-Euclidean metrics, used e.g. for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF): all conservation laws can be determined in the gradient flow context, yet none persists in the momentum case.">

We propose to use"low-rank plus diagonal"PSD matrices as approximations that can be stored with a memory cost being linear in the high dimension d. To constrain the solution of the differential equation to remain in that subset, we project the derivative at all times onto the tangent space to the subset, following the methodology of dynamical low-rank approximation. We derive a closed-form formula for the projection, and show that after some manipulations it can be computed with a numerical cost being linear in d, allowing for tractable implementation. Contrary to previous approaches based on pure low-rank approximations, the addition of the diagonal term allows for our approximations to be invertible matrices, that can moreover be inverted with linear cost in d. We apply the technique to Riccati-like equations, then to two particular problems. Firstly a low-rank approximation to our recent Wasserstein gradient flow for Gaussian approximation of posterior distributions in approximate Bayesian inference, and secondly a novel low-rank approximation of the Kalman filter for high-dimensional systems.

        <tr id="We present a novel set of rigorous and computationally efficient topology-based complexity notions that exhibit a strong correlation with the generalization gap in modern deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs show remarkable generalization properties, yet the source of these capabilities remains elusive, defying the established statistical learning theory. Recent studies have revealed that properties of training trajectories can be indicative of generalization. Building on this insight, state-of-the-art methods have leveraged the topology of these trajectories, particularly their fractal dimension, to quantify generalization. Most existing works compute this quantity by assuming continuous- or infinite-time training dynamics, complicating the development of practical estimators capable of accurately predicting generalization without access to test data. In this paper, we respect the discrete-time nature of training trajectories and investigate the underlying topological quantities that can be amenable to topological data analysis tools. This leads to a new family of reliable topological complexity measures that provably bound the generalization error, eliminating the need for restrictive geometric assumptions. These measures are computationally friendly, enabling us to propose simple yet effective algorithms for computing generalization indices. Moreover, our flexible framework can be extended to different domains, tasks, and architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new complexity measures correlate highly with generalization error in industry-standards architectures such as transformers and deep graph networks. Our approach consistently outperforms existing topological bounds across a wide range of datasets, models, and optimizers, highlighting the practical relevance and effectiveness of our complexity measures.">

        <tr id="The renormalization group (RG) constitutes a fundamental framework in modern theoretical physics. It allows the study of many systems showing states with large-scale correlations and their classification in a relatively small set of universality classes. RG is the most powerful tool for investigating organizational scales within dynamic systems. However, the application of RG techniques to complex networks has presented significant challenges, primarily due to the intricate interplay of correlations on multiple scales. Existing approaches have relied on hypotheses involving hidden geometries and based on embedding complex networks into hidden metric spaces. Here, we present a practical overview of the recently introduced Laplacian Renormalization Group for heterogeneous networks. First, we present a brief overview that justifies the use of the Laplacian as a natural extension for well-known field theories to analyze spatial disorder. We then draw an analogy to traditional real-space renormalization group procedures, explaining how the LRG generalizes the concept of"Kadanoff supernodes"as block nodes that span multiple scales. These supernodes help mitigate the effects of cross-scale correlations due to small-world properties. Additionally, we rigorously define the LRG procedure in momentum space in the spirit of Wilson RG. Finally, we show different analyses for the evolution of network properties along the LRG flow following structural changes when the network is properly reduced.">

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

Our identification is based on the application of several space-dependent excitations (also called controls). These specific controls are designed by the algorithm in order to obtain a deeper insight into the underlying physical problem and a more precise reconstruction of the unknown relation.

Concurrently, the accuracy of prediction in dynamical systems from mechanics has long been a classic subject of investigation since the discovery of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle employs covariance and standard deviation of particle states to measure prediction accuracy. In this study, we bring these two approaches together to analyze the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm in two-player zero-sum games. We provide growth rates of covariance information for continuous-time FTRL, as well as its two canonical discretization methods (Euler and Symplectic). A Heisenberg-type inequality is established for FTRL. Our analysis and experiments also show that employing Symplectic discretization enhances the accuracy of prediction in learning dynamics.">

        <tr id="We introduce a method that combines neural operators, physics-informed machine learning, and standard numerical methods for solving PDEs. The proposed approach extends each of the aforementioned methods and unifies them within a single framework. We can parametrically solve partial differential equations in a data-free manner and provide accurate sensitivities, meaning the derivatives of the solution space with respect to the design space. These capabilities enable gradient-based optimization without the typical sensitivity analysis costs, unlike adjoint methods that scale directly with the number of response functions. Our Finite Operator Learning (FOL) approach uses an uncomplicated feed-forward neural network model to directly map the discrete design space (i.e. parametric input space) to the discrete solution space (i.e. finite number of sensor points in the arbitrary shape domain) ensuring compliance with physical laws by designing them into loss functions. The discretized governing equations, as well as the design and solution spaces, can be derived from any well-established numerical techniques. In this work, we employ the Finite Element Method (FEM) to approximate fields and their spatial derivatives. Subsequently, we conduct Sobolev training to minimize a multi-objective loss function, which includes the discretized weak form of the energy functional, boundary conditions violations, and the stationarity of the residuals with respect to the design variables. Our study focuses on the steady-state heat equation within heterogeneous materials that exhibits significant phase contrast and possibly temperature-dependent conductivity. The network's tangent matrix is directly used for gradient-based optimization to improve the microstructure's heat transfer characteristics. ...">

The DEQH model inherently captures the self-consistency nature of Hamiltonian, a critical aspect often overlooked by traditional machine learning approaches for Hamiltonian prediction. By employing DEQ within our model architecture, we circumvent the need for DFT calculations during the training phase to introduce the Hamiltonian's self-consistency, thus addressing computational bottlenecks associated with large or complex systems. We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian. Ablation studies of DEQHNet further elucidate the network's effectiveness, offering insights into the potential of DEQ-integrated networks for Hamiltonian learning.">

        <tr id="Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.">

However, classical neural network methods for solving nonlinear PDEs, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), Deep Ritz methods, and DeepONet, often encounter challenges when confronted with the presence of multiple solutions inherent in the nonlinear problem. These methods may encounter ill-posedness issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the Newton Informed Neural Operator, which builds upon existing neural network techniques to tackle nonlinearities.

        <tr id="In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible. While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii). The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.">

        <tr id="In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces, but in a learning equilibrium, the problem can be linearized and reduced to many weakly coupled one-dimensional problems. We use the duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distributions of fluctuations of the trainable variables. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.">

Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

Many applications can be found on optimization over Stiefel manifold within the area of physics and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel idea by tackling the Stiefel manifold through an nonlinear eigen-approach by first using ADMM to split the problem into smooth optimization over manifold and convex non-smooth optimization, and then transforming the former into the form of nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency (NEPv) which is solved by self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, and the latter can be found to have an closed-form solution through proximal gradient.

        <tr id="Bifurcations mark qualitative changes of long-term behavior in dynamical systems and can often signal sudden ("hard") transitions or catastrophic events (divergences). Accurately locating them is critical not just for deeper understanding of observed dynamic behavior, but also for designing efficient interventions. When the dynamical system at hand is complex, possibly noisy, and expensive to sample, standard (e.g. continuation based) numerical methods may become impractical. We propose an active learning framework, where Bayesian Optimization is leveraged to discover saddle-node or Hopf bifurcations, from a judiciously chosen small number of vector field observations. Such an approach becomes especially attractive in systems whose state x parameter space exploration is resource-limited. It also naturally provides a framework for uncertainty quantification (aleatoric and epistemic), useful in systems with inherent stochasticity.">

        <tr id="We present a novel method for training score-based generative models which uses nonlinear noising dynamics to improve learning of structured distributions. Generalizing to a nonlinear drift allows for additional structure to be incorporated into the dynamics, thus making the training better adapted to the data, e.g., in the case of multimodality or (approximate) symmetries. Such structure can be obtained from the data by an inexpensive preprocessing step. The nonlinear dynamics introduces new challenges into training which we address in two ways: 1) we develop a new nonlinear denoising score matching (NDSM) method, 2) we introduce neural control variates in order to reduce the variance of the NDSM training objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on several examples: a) a collection of low-dimensional examples, motivated by clustering in latent space, b) high-dimensional images, addressing issues with mode collapse, small training sets, and approximate symmetries, the latter being a challenge for methods based on equivariant neural networks, which require exact symmetries.">

        <tr id="We investigate discrete-time conewise linear systems (CLS) for which all the solutions exhibit a finite number of switches. By switches, we mean transitions of a solution from one cone to another. Our interest in this class of CLS comes from the optimization-based control of an insulin infusion model for which the fact that solutions switch finitely many times appears to be key to establish the global exponential stability of the origin. The stability analysis of this class of CLS greatly simplifies compared to general CLS as all solutions eventually exhibit linear dynamics. The main challenge is to characterize CLS satisfying this finite number of switches property. We first present general conditions in terms of set intersections for this purpose. To ease the testing of these conditions, we translate them as a non-negativity test of linear forms using Farkas lemma. As a result, the problem reduces to verify the non-negativity of a single solution to an auxiliary linear discrete-time system. Interestingly, this property differs from the classical non-negativity problem, where any solution to a system must remain non-negative (component-wise) for any non-negative initial condition, and thus requires novel tools to test it. We finally illustrate the relevance of the presented results on the optimal insulin infusion problem.">

Here, hinging on ideas from group representation theory, we define trainable layers whose algebraic structure is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the lattice cell. Our method naturally allows for efficient implementations, both in terms of memory usage and computational costs, supporting scalable training/testing for lattices in two spatial dimensions and higher, as the size of symmetry group grows. We validate and test our approach considering 2D and 3D flowing dynamics, both in laminar and turbulent regimes. We compare with group averaged-based symmetric networks and with plain, non-symmetric, networks, showing how our approach unlocks the (a-posteriori) accuracy and training stability of the former models, and the train/inference speed of the latter networks (LENNs are about one order of magnitude faster than group-averaged networks in 3D).

        <tr id="Port-Hamiltonian systems (pHS) allow for a structure-preserving modeling of dynamical systems. Coupling pHS via linear relations between input and output defines an overall pHS, which is structure preserving. However, in multiphysics applications, some subsystems do not allow for a physical pHS description, as (a) this is not available or (b) too expensive. Here, data-driven approaches can be used to deliver a pHS for such subsystems, which can then be coupled to the other subsystems in a structure-preserving way. In this work, we derive a data-driven identification approach for port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The approach uses input and state space data to estimate nonlinear effort functions of pH-DAEs. As underlying technique, we us (multi-task) Gaussian processes. This work thereby extends over the current state of the art, in which only port-Hamiltonian ordinary differential equation systems could be identified via Gaussian processes. We apply this approach successfully to two applications from network design and constrained multibody system dynamics, based on pH-DAE system of index one and three, respectively.">

        <tr id="Predicting the conditional evolution of Volterra processes with stochastic volatility is a crucial challenge in mathematical finance. While deep neural network models offer promise in approximating the conditional law of such processes, their effectiveness is hindered by the curse of dimensionality caused by the infinite dimensionality and non-smooth nature of these problems. To address this, we propose a two-step solution. Firstly, we develop a stable dimension reduction technique, projecting the law of a reasonably broad class of Volterra process onto a low-dimensional statistical manifold of non-positive sectional curvature. Next, we introduce a sequentially deep learning model tailored to the manifold's geometry, which we show can approximate the projected conditional law of the Volterra process. Our model leverages an auxiliary hypernetwork to dynamically update its internal parameters, allowing it to encode non-stationary dynamics of the Volterra process, and it can be interpreted as a gating mechanism in a mixture of expert models where each expert is specialized at a specific point in time. Our hypernetwork further allows us to achieve approximation rates that would seemingly only be possible with very large networks.">

        <tr id="One puzzling artifact in machine learning dubbed grokking is where delayed generalization is achieved tenfolds of iterations after near perfect overfitting to the training data. Focusing on the long delay itself on behalf of machine learning practitioners, our goal is to accelerate generalization of a model under grokking phenomenon. By regarding a series of gradients of a parameter over training iterations as a random signal over time, we can spectrally decompose the parameter trajectories under gradient descent into two components: the fast-varying, overfitting-yielding component and the slow-varying, generalization-inducing component. This analysis allows us to accelerate the grokking phenomenon more than $\times 50$ with only a few lines of code that amplifies the slow-varying components of gradients. The experiments show that our algorithm applies to diverse tasks involving images, languages, and graphs, enabling practical availability of this peculiar artifact of sudden generalization.

        <tr id="Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve the PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a specific set of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation or a finite set of coefficients. This bottleneck limits the generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major advantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a Transformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable generalizability and scalability.">

Most applications of TPT either focus on systems with modestly sized state spaces or use collective variables to try to tame the curse of dimensionality. Increasingly, expressive function approximators like neural networks and tensor networks have shown promise in computing the central object of TPT, the committor function, even in very high dimensional systems. That progress prompts our consideration of how one could use such a high dimensional function to extract mechanistic insight. Here, we present and illustrate a straightforward but powerful way to track how individual dynamical coordinates evolve during a reactive event. The strategy, which involves marginalizing the reactive ensemble, naturally captures the evolution of the dynamical coordinate's distribution, not just its mean reactive behavior.">

We accelerate the algorithm using a novel change of basis approach to account for the (known) smallest eigenvalue-eigenvector pair of the matrices involved, coupled with a simple but frequently very effective diagonal preconditioning approach.

        <tr id="Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.">

        <tr id="The article is devoted to the creation of methodological foundations for solving a direct problem of dynamics for linear dynamic systems, the motion of which is described by ordinary differential equations with nonzero initial conditions. Consideration of the motions of linear dynamic systems allows to simplify the mathematical apparatus used and to solve motion determination problems by using a known approach based on transfer functions. However, due to the fact that the classical definition of transfer functions does not involve taking into account non-zero initial conditions, which are caused by the presence of initial deviations of the coordinates of the control object from their desired values, in our work we use the Laplace-Carson transformation to find the corresponding images and write the equations of motion in operator form. This approach, in contrast to the generally acceptedone, led to the introduction of information about the initial conditions of motion in the right-hand side of the corresponding operator differential equations and necessitated the generalization of the vector of control signals by including in it components that take into account the initial conditions of motion of the system under consideration. Such transformations made it possible to generalize the concept of a matrix transfer function as a matrix linear dynamic operator, which consists of two components that define disturbed free and controlled forced movements. The use of such an operator makes it possible to study the dynamics of the considered linear system both separately for each of the components of the generalized vector of controlling influences, and in the complex, thus solving the direct problem of the dynamics of linear systems.">

        <tr id="Inverse problems describe the process of estimating the causal factors from a set of measurements or data. Mapping of often incomplete or degraded data to parameters is ill-posed, thus data-driven iterative solutions are required, for example when reconstructing clean images from poor signals. Diffusion models have shown promise as potent generative tools for solving inverse problems due to their superior reconstruction quality and their compatibility with iterative solvers. However, most existing approaches are limited to linear inverse problems represented as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). This simplification falls short of addressing the challenging nature of real-world problems, leading to amplified cumulative errors and biases. We provide an explanation for this gap through the lens of measure-preserving dynamics of Random Dynamical Systems (RDS) with which we analyse Temporal Distribution Discrepancy and thus introduce a theoretical framework based on RDS for SDE diffusion models. We uncover several strategies that inherently enhance the stability and generalizability of diffusion models for inverse problems and introduce a novel score-based diffusion framework, the \textbf{D}ynamics-aware S\textbf{D}E \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{M}odel (D$^3$GM). The \textit{Measure-preserving property} can return the degraded measurement to the original state despite complex degradation with the RDS concept of \textit{stability}. Our extensive experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of D$^3$GM across multiple benchmarks including a prominent application for inverse problems, magnetic resonance imaging.

        <tr id="Equilibrium propagation is a learning technique conceived for training continuous-time recurrent neural networks. It offers some notable advantages when compared to conventional back-propagation-based algorithms and to classical design methods. From an implementation perspective, it demands only a single computational circuit. Theoretically, although it seeks to minimize a cost function, it exhibits similarities to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), rendering it, to a certain extent, biologically plausible. This paper explores the global dynamic behavior of continuous-time piecewise linear networks trained through equilibrium point propagation. We examine a network in which the target patterns are presented as external inputs rather than as initial conditions. We first show that the learning rules, which extend equilibrium propagation to gradient-like and non-symmetric networks, can be derived as a suitable approximation of Lagrangian optimization. Then, by studying a relatively simple but thoroughly significant case, we demonstrate that a detailed analysis of the equilibrium point distribution yields a profound understanding of the network’s fundamental properties and provides a valuable tool for quantitatively evaluating the network’s accuracy. Compared to classical synthesis techniques, our approach, where patterns are introduced as external inputs, in most cases, circumvents the impractical task of estimating the basins of attraction for sets of multiple equilibrium points. Furthermore, preliminary extensive simulations indicate that the primary dynamic features observed in relatively small networks closely resemble those ensuring the performance and accuracy of large-scale networks.">

We introduce Bayesian Entropy Neural Networks (BENN), a framework grounded in Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principles, designed to impose constraints on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) predictions. BENN is capable of constraining not only the predicted values but also their derivatives and variances, ensuring a more robust and reliable model output. To achieve simultaneous uncertainty quantification and constraint satisfaction, we employ the method of multipliers approach. This allows for the concurrent estimation of neural network parameters and the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the constraints. Our experiments, spanning diverse applications such as beam deflection modeling and microstructure generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of BENN. The results highlight significant improvements over traditional BNNs and showcase competitive performance relative to contemporary constrained deep learning methods.">

        <tr id="We propose an actor-critic algorithm for a family of complex problems arising in algebraic statistics and discrete optimization. The core task is to produce a sample from a finite subset of the non-negative integer lattice defined by a high-dimensional polytope. We translate the problem into a Markov decision process and devise an actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to learn a set of good moves that can be used for sampling. We prove that the actor-critic algorithm converges to an approximately optimal sampling policy. To tackle complexity issues that typically arise in these sampling problems, and to allow the RL to function at scale, our solution strategy takes three steps: decomposing the starting point of the sample, using RL on each induced subproblem, and reconstructing to obtain a sample in the original polytope. In this setup, the proof of convergence applies to each subproblem in the decomposition. We test the method in two regimes. In statistical applications, a high-dimensional polytope arises as the support set for the reference distribution in a model/data fit test for a broad family of statistical models for categorical data. We demonstrate how RL can be used for model fit testing problems for data sets for which traditional MCMC samplers converge too slowly due to problem size and sparsity structure. To test the robustness of the algorithm and explore its generalization properties, we apply it to synthetically generated data of various sizes and sparsity levels.">

        <tr id="We present a domain decomposition strategy for developing structure-preserving finite element discretizations from data when exact governing equations are unknown. On subdomains, trainable Whitney form elements are used to identify structure-preserving models from data, providing a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map which may be used to globally construct a mortar method. The reduced-order local elements may be trained offline to reproduce high-fidelity Dirichlet data in cases where first principles model derivation is either intractable, unknown, or computationally prohibitive. In such cases, particular care must be taken to preserve structure on both local and mortar levels without knowledge of the governing equations, as well as to ensure well-posedness and stability of the resulting monolithic data-driven system. This strategy provides a flexible means of both scaling to large systems and treating complex geometries, and is particularly attractive for multiscale problems with complex microstructure geometry. While consistency is traditionally obtained in finite element methods via quasi-optimality results and the Bramble-Hilbert lemma as the local element diameter $h\rightarrow0$, our analysis establishes notions of accuracy and stability for finite h with accuracy coming from matching data. Numerical experiments and analysis establish properties for $H(\operatorname{div})$ problems in small data limits ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ reference solutions).">

        <tr id="Neural network-based approaches have recently shown significant promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering, especially in scenarios featuring complex domains or the incorporation of empirical data. One advantage of the neural network method for PDEs lies in its automatic differentiation (AD), which necessitates only the sample points themselves, unlike traditional finite difference (FD) approximations that require nearby local points to compute derivatives. In this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of AD in training neural networks. The concept of truncated entropy is introduced to characterize the training property. Specifically, through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses conducted on random feature models and two-layer neural networks, we discover that the defined truncated entropy serves as a reliable metric for quantifying the residual loss of random feature models and the training speed of neural networks for both AD and FD methods. Our experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that, from a training perspective, AD outperforms FD in solving partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="We consider estimators obtained by iterates of the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm applied to the normal equation of prototypical statistical inverse problems. Stopping the CG algorithm early induces regularisation, and optimal convergence rates of prediction and reconstruction error are established in wide generality for an ideal oracle stopping time. Based on this insight, a fully data-driven early stopping rule $\tau$ is constructed, which also attains optimal rates, provided the error in estimating the noise level is not dominant. The error analysis of CG under statistical noise is subtle due to its nonlinear dependence on the observations. We provide an explicit error decomposition into two terms, which shares important properties of the classical bias-variance decomposition. Together with a continuous interpolation between CG iterates, this paves the way for a comprehensive error analysis of early stopping. In particular, a general oracle-type inequality is proved for the prediction error at $\tau$. For bounding the reconstruction error, a more refined probabilistic analysis, based on concentration of self-normalised Gaussian processes, is developed. The methodology also provides some new insights into early stopping for CG in deterministic inverse problems. A numerical study for standard examples shows good results in practice for early stopping at $\tau$.">

The paper details how a recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be transformed into a contraction in a domain where its parameters are linear. It then demonstrates that a prediction problem modeled through an RNN, with a specific regularization term in the loss function, can have its first-order conditions expressed analytically. This system of equations is reduced to two matrix equations involving Sylvester equations, which can be partially solved. We establish that, if certain conditions are met, optimal parameters exist, are unique, and can be found through a straightforward algorithm to any desired precision. Also, as the number of neurons grows the conditions of convergence become easier to fulfill. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are also explored by including linear constraints on parameters. According to our model, incorporating loops (with fixed or variable weights) will produce loss functions that train easier, because it assures the existence of a region where an iterative method converges.">

However, currently available neural network-based modeling approaches fall short when faced with data collected randomly over time and space, as is often the case with sensor networks in real-world applications like crowdsourced earthquake detection or pollution monitoring. In response, we developed a new spatiotemporal method that effectively handles such randomly sampled data. Our model integrates techniques from amortized variational inference, neural differential equations, neural point processes, and implicit neural representations to predict both the dynamics of the system and the probabilistic locations and timings of future observations. It outperforms existing methods on challenging spatiotemporal datasets by offering substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a useful tool for modeling and understanding complex dynamical systems observed under realistic, unconstrained conditions.">

        <tr id="Many cognitive models, including those for predicting the time of future events, can be mapped onto a particular form of neural representation in which activity across a population of neurons is restricted to manifolds that specify the Laplace transform of functions of continuous variables. These populations coding Laplace transform are associated with another population that inverts the transform, approximating the original function. This paper presents a neural circuit that uses continuous attractor dynamics to represent the Laplace transform of a delta function evolving in time. One population places an edge at any location along a 1-D array of neurons; another population places a bump at a location corresponding to the edge. Together these two populations can estimate a Laplace transform of delta functions in time along with an approximate inverse transform. Building the circuit so the edge moves at an appropriate speed enables the network to represent events as a function of log time. Choosing the connections appropriately within the edge network make the network states map onto Laplace transform with exponential change as a function of time. In this paper we model a learned temporal association in which one stimulus predicts another at some fixed delay $T$. Shortly after $t=0$ the first stimulus recedes into the past. The Laplace Neural Manifold representing the past maintains the Laplace transform $\exp(-st)$. Another Laplace Neural Manifold represents the predicted future. At $t=0$, the second stimulus is represented a time $T$ in the future. At each moment between 0 and $T$, firing over the Laplace transform predicting the future changes as $\exp[-s(T-t)]$. Despite exponential growth in firing, the circuit is robust to noise, making it a practical means to implement Laplace Neural Manifolds in populations of neurons for a variety of cognitive models.">

        <tr id="Nonlinear dynamics play an important role in the analysis of signals. A popular, readily interpretable nonlinear measure is Permutation Entropy. It has recently been extended for the analysis of graph signals, thus providing a framework for non-linear analysis of data sampled on irregular domains. Here, we introduce a continuous version of Permutation Entropy, extend it to the graph domain, and develop a ordinal activation function akin to the one of neural networks. This is a step towards Ordinal Deep Learning, a potentially effective and very recently posited concept. We also formally extend ordinal contrasts to the graph domain. Continuous versions of ordinal contrasts of length 3 are also introduced and their advantage is shown in experiments. We also integrate specific contrasts for the analysis of images and show that it generalizes well to the graph domain allowing a representation of images, represented as graph signals, in a plane similar to the entropy-complexity one. Applications to synthetic data, including fractal patterns and popular non-linear maps, and real-life MRI data show the validity of these novel extensions and potential benefits over the state of the art. By extending very recent concepts related to permutation entropy to the graph domain, we expect to accelerate the development of more graph-based entropy methods to enable nonlinear analysis of a broader kind of data and establishing relationships with emerging ideas in data science.">

Consequently in our second step those groups are handled separately without the information loss on the overall linear dynamic structure. The second step is devoted to establishing a finite-dimensional dynamical structure for all the transformed functional time series within each group. Furthermore the finite-dimensional structure is represented by that of a vector time series. Modelling and forecasting for the original high-dimensional functional time series are realized via those for the vector time series in all the groups. We investigate the theoretical properties of our proposed methods, and illustrate the finite-sample performance through both extensive simulation and two real datasets.">

When optimizing a single real-valued function (the one-parameter setting), there is a canonical choice of descriptor for persistent homology: the barcode. The operation mapping a real-valued function to its barcode is differentiable almost everywhere, and the convergence of gradient descent for losses using barcodes is relatively well understood. When optimizing a vector-valued function (the multiparameter setting), there is no unique choice of descriptor for multiparameter persistent homology, and many distinct descriptors have been proposed. This calls for the development of a general framework for differentiability and optimization that applies to a wide range of multiparameter homological descriptors. In this article, we develop such a framework and show that it encompasses well-known descriptors of different flavors, such as signed barcodes and the multiparameter persistence landscape. We complement the theory with numerical experiments supporting the idea that optimizing multiparameter homological descriptors can lead to improved performances compared to optimizing one-parameter descriptors, even when using the simplest and most efficiently computable multiparameter descriptors.">

Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="In this short article we present the theory of sparse representations recovery in convex regularized optimization problems introduced in (Carioni and Del Grande, arXiv:2311.08072, 2023). We focus on the scenario where the unknowns belong to Banach spaces and measurements are taken in Hilbert spaces, exploring the properties of minimizers of optimization problems in such settings. Specifically, we analyze a Tikhonov-regularized convex optimization problem, where $y_0$ are the measured data, $w$ denotes the noise, and $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter. By introducing a Metric Non-Degenerate Source Condition (MNDSC) and considering sufficiently small $\lambda$ and $w$, we establish Exact Sparse Representation Recovery (ESRR) for our problems, meaning that the minimizer is unique and precisely recovers the sparse representation of the original data. We then emphasize the practical implications of this theoretical result through two novel applications: signal demixing and super-resolution with Group BLASSO. These applications underscore the broad applicability and significance of our result, showcasing its potential across different domains.">

        <tr id="Hybrid dynamical systems are prevalent in science and engineering to express complex systems with continuous and discrete states. To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and six non-hybrid systems show that our method outperforms previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.">

The proposed Tikhonov regularization scheme incorporates a penalty term that takes three distinct yet intricately related network (semi)norms: the extended Barron norm, the variation norm, and the Radon-BV seminorm. These choices of the penalty term are contingent upon the specific architecture of the neural network being utilized. We establish the connection between various network norms and particularly trace the dependence of the dimensionality index, aiming to deepen our understanding of how these norms interplay with each other. We revisit the universality of function approximation through various norms, establish rigorous error-bound analysis for the Tikhonov regularization scheme, and explicitly elucidate the dependency of the dimensionality index, providing a clearer understanding of how the dimensionality affects the approximation performance and how one designs a neural network with diverse approximating tasks.">

        <tr id="We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the 'explicit' dynamics of the object with an 'implicit' flow on free energy gradients - a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.">

This equation describes the evolution of the distribution of nonlocally interacting particles affected by a common source of noise. The system is directed by a controller that acts on the drift term with the goal of minimising a cost functional. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation, prove the existence of optimal controls, and formulate a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) that provides necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the control problem. The adjoint process arising in the SMP is characterised by a nonlocal (semi)linear backward SPDE for which we study existence and uniqueness. We also rigorously connect the control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker--Planck equation to the control of the corresponding McKean--Vlasov SDE that describes the motion of a representative particle. Our work extends existing results for the control of the Fokker--Planck equation to nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. In particular, the sufficient SMP, which we obtain by exploiting the special structure of the Fokker--Planck equation, seems to be novel even in the linear deterministic setting.

While both information-theoretic and algorithmic limits are well understood when the noise is a Gaussian Wigner matrix, the more realistic case of structured noise still proves to be challenging. To capture the structure while maintaining mathematical tractability, a line of work has focused on rotationally invariant noise. However, existing studies either provide sub-optimal algorithms or are limited to special cases of noise ensembles. In this paper, using tools from statistical physics (replica method) and random matrix theory (generalized spherical integrals) we establish the first characterization of the information-theoretic limits for a noise matrix drawn from a general trace ensemble. Remarkably, our analysis unveils the asymptotic equivalence between the rotationally invariant model and a surrogate Gaussian one. Finally, we show how to saturate the predicted statistical limits using an efficient algorithm inspired by the theory of adaptive Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equations.">

Typically, constrained problems are solved via their min-max Lagrangian formulations, which exhibit unstable oscillatory dynamics when optimized using gradient descent-ascent. The adoption of constrained optimization techniques in the machine learning community is currently limited by the lack of reliable, general-purpose update schemes for the Lagrange multipliers. This paper proposes the $\nu$PI algorithm and contributes an optimization perspective on Lagrange multiplier updates based on PI controllers, extending the work of Stooke, Achiam and Abbeel (2020). We provide theoretical and empirical insights explaining the inability of momentum methods to address the shortcomings of gradient descent-ascent, and contrast this with the empirical success of our proposed $\nu$PI controller. Moreover, we prove that $\nu$PI generalizes popular momentum methods for single-objective minimization. Our experiments demonstrate that $\nu$PI reliably stabilizes the multiplier dynamics and its hyperparameters enjoy robust and predictable behavior.">

During operation, the emergence of localization is difficult to predict, partly because of changing parameters over the life cycle of a system. This work proposes a novel, network-based approach to predicting an imminent localized vibration. Synthetic measurement data is used to generate a functional network, which captures the dynamic interplay of the machine parts, complementary to their geometric coupling. Analysis of these functional networks reveals an impending localized vibration and its location. The method is demonstrated using a model system for a bladed disk, a ring composed of coupled nonlinear Duffing oscillators. Results indicate that the proposed method is robust against small parameter uncertainties, added measurement noise, and the length of the measurement data samples.

        <tr id="Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a frequently used optimization technique in classical machine learning and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). For the implementation of VQE on quantum hardware, the results are always affected by measurement shot noise. However, there are many unknowns about the structure and properties of the measurement noise in VQE and how it contributes to the optimization. In this work, we analyze the effect of measurement noise to the optimization dynamics. Especially, we focus on escaping from saddle points in the loss landscape, which is crucial in the minimization of the non-convex loss function. We find that the escape time (1) decreases as the measurement noise increases in a power-law fashion and (2) is expressed as a function of $\eta/N_s$ where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $N_s$ is the number of measurements. The latter means that the escape time is approximately constant when we vary $\eta$ and $N_s$ with the ratio $\eta/N_s$ held fixed. This scaling behavior is well explained by the stochastic differential equation (SDE) that is obtained by the continuous-time approximation of the discrete-time SGD. According to the SDE, $\eta/N_s$ is interpreted as the variance of measurement shot noise. This result tells us that we can learn about the optimization dynamics in VQE from the analysis based on the continuous-time SDE, which is theoretically simpler than the original discrete-time SGD.">

This work quantifies the impact of entropy regularization on the convergence of policy gradient methods for stochastic exit time control problems. We analyze a continuous-time policy mirror descent dynamics, which updates the policy based on the gradient of an entropy-regularized value function and adjusts the strength of entropy regularization as the algorithm progresses. We prove that with a fixed entropy level, the dynamics converges exponentially to the optimal solution of the regularized problem. We further show that when the entropy level decays at suitable polynomial rates, the annealed flow converges to the solution of the unregularized problem at a rate of $\mathcal O(1/S)$ for discrete action spaces and, under suitable conditions, at a rate of $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{S})$ for general action spaces, with $S$ being the gradient flow time. This paper explains how entropy regularization improves policy optimization, even with the true gradient, from the perspective of convergence rate.">

For $N$ agents, the interaction cost has $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity, which can be prohibitively slow to evaluate and differentiate when $N$ is large. To this end, we propose an efficient primal-dual algorithm that utilizes basis expansions of the kernels. The basis expansions reduce the cost of computing the interactions, while the primal-dual methodology decouples the agents at the expense of solving for a moderate number of dual variables. We also demonstrate that our approach can further be structured in a multi-resolution manner, where we estimate optimal dual variables using a moderate $N$ and solve decoupled trajectory optimization problems for large $N$. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on an optimal control of 5000 interacting quadrotors.">

Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for non-convex functions, with interpolating rates for arbitrary subspace sizes and allowing inexact curvature estimation.

The core idea of ElastoGen is converting the global differential operator, corresponding to the nonlinear elastodynamic equations, into iterative local convolution-like operations, which naturally fit modern neural networks. Each network module is specifically designed to support this goal rather than functioning as a black box. As a result, ElastoGen is exceptionally lightweight in terms of both training requirements and network scale. Additionally, due to its alignment with physical procedures, ElastoGen efficiently generates accurate dynamics for a wide range of hyperelastic materials and can be easily integrated with upstream and downstream deep modules to enable end-to-end 4D generation.">

The present paper proves this. For a large class of nonlinearities, with possibly superlinear growth, a temporal rate of (almost) $1$ is proven, a major improvement on the rate $1/4$ that is known to be optimal for schemes based on Wiener increments.

The information flow describes the direction and the magnitude of an excitatory neuron’s influence to the neighbouring neurons. However, the intricate relationship between network dynamics and information flows is not well understood. Here, we address this challenge by first identifying a generic mechanism that defines the evolution of various information routing patterns in response to modifications in the underlying network dynamics. Moreover, with emerging techniques in brain stimulation, designing optimal stimulation directed towards a target region with an acceptable magnitude remains an ongoing and significant challenge. In this work, we also introduce techniques for computing optimal inputs that follow a desired stimulation routing path towards the target brain region. This optimization problem can be efficiently resolved using non-linear programming tools and permits the simultaneous assignment of multiple desired patterns at different instances. We establish the algebraic and graph-theoretic conditions necessary to ensure the feasibility and stability of information routing patterns (IRPs). We illustrate the routing mechanisms and control methods for attaining desired patterns in biological oscillatory dynamics. Author Summary A complex network is described by collection of subsystems or nodes, often exchanging information among themselves via fixed interconnection pattern or structure of the network. This combination of nodes, interconnection structure and the information exchange enables the overall network system to function. These information exchange patterns change over time and switch patterns whenever a node or set of nodes are subject to external perturbations or stimulations. In many cases one would want to drive the system to desired information patterns, resulting in desired network system behaviour, by appropriately designing the perturbating signals. We present mathematical framework to design perturbation signals that drive the system to the desired behaviour. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the context of brain stimulation and in modifying causal interactions in gene regulatory networks.">

        <tr id="State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.">

Lavenant et al. arXiv:2102.09204 addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure. Chizat et al. arXiv:2205.07146 then provided a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the overwhelming success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce PO-MFL to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees by extending the results of arXiv:2102.09204 to the partially observed setting. We leverage the MFL framework of arXiv:2205.07146, yielding an algorithm based on entropic OT between dynamics-adjusted adjacent time marginals. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free method of arXiv:2205.07146 in key scenarios.">

Recently developed quantum acoustics, emphasizing the wave nature of lattice vibrations, hasenabled the exploration of previously uncharted territories of electron–lattice interaction not accessible with conventional tools such as perturbation theory. In this context, our agenda here is two-fold. First, we showcase the application of machine learning methods to categorize various interaction regimes within the subtle interplay of electrons and the dynamical lattice landscape. Second, we shed light on a nebulous region of electron dynamics identified by the machine learning approach and then attribute it to transient localization, where strong lattice vibrations result in a momentary Anderson prison for electronic wavepackets, which are later released by the evolution of the lattice. Overall, our research illuminates the spectrum of dynamics within the Fröhlich model, such as transient localization, which has been suggested as a pivotal factor contributing to the mysteries surrounding strange metals. Furthermore, this paves the way for utilizing time-dependent perspectives in machine learning techniques for designing materials with tailored electron–lattice properties.">

In this work, we shortly discuss, which types of models are usually combined and propose a model interface that is capable of expressing a width variety of mixed algebraic, discrete and differential equation based models. Further, we examine different established, as well as new ways of combining these models from a system theoretical point of view and highlight two challenges - algebraic loops and local event affect functions in discontinuous models - that require a special approach. Finally, we propose a new wildcard topology, that is capable of describing the generic connection between two combined models in an easy to interpret fashion that can be learned as part of a gradient based optimization procedure. The contributions of this paper are highlighted at a proof of concept: Different connection topologies between two models are learned, interpreted and compared applying the proposed methodology and software implementation.">

        <tr id="Localized persistent neural activity has been shown to serve delayed estimation of continuous variables. Common experiments require that subjects store and report the feature value (e.g., orientation) of a particular cue (e.g., oriented bar on a screen) after a delay. Visualizing recorded activity of neurons according to their feature tuning reveals activity bumps whose centers wander stochastically, degrading the estimate over time. Bump position therefore represents the remembered estimate. Recent work suggests that bump amplitude may represent estimate certainty reflecting a probabilistic population code for a Bayesian posterior. Idealized models of this type are fragile due to the fine tuning common to constructed continuum attractors in dynamical systems. Here we propose an alternative metastable model for robustly supporting multiple bump amplitudes by extending neural circuit models to include quantized nonlinearities. Asymptotic projections of circuit activity produce low-dimensional evolution equations for the amplitude and position of bump solutions in response to external stimuli and noise perturbations. Analysis of reduced equations accurately characterizes phase variance and the dynamics of amplitude transitions between stable discrete values. More salient cues generate bumps of higher amplitude which wander less, consistent with the experimental finding that greater certainty correlates with more accurate memories.">

The main novelty in this work is in the application of a"multiple time-delayed feedback"(MTDF) approach, where several control terms are required to attenuate a broad range of unstable eigenfrequencies. We implement a gradient descent method to dynamically adjust the gain functions, $G_i(t),$ in order to reduce the need for tuning a high dimensional parameter space. We consider the effect of the control terms via an approximate linear analysis and a frequency-domain analysis, which justifies the choice of MTDF parameters. By using an adaptive approach to setting the control gains, we advocate for a broad range of MTDF terms which are then free to find their own stabilising amplitudes for a given target solution, thereby removing trial and error when the instability of the target solution is unknown a'priori. This also enables travelling waves to be stabilised from generic turbulent states and with speculative starting parameters.">

This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out.

        <tr id="Neural networks are lately more and more often being used in the context of data-driven control, as an approximate model of the true system dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) adopts this practise leading to neural MPC strategies. This raises a question of whether the trained neural network has converged and generalized in a way that the learned model encapsulates an accurate approximation of the true dynamic model of the system, thus making it a reliable choice for model-based control, especially for disturbed and uncertain systems. To tackle that, we propose Dropout MPC, a novel sampling-based ensemble neural MPC algorithm that employs the Monte-Carlo dropout technique on the learned system model. The closed loop is based on an ensemble of predictive controllers, that are used simultaneously at each time-step for trajectory optimization. Each member of the ensemble influences the control input, based on a weighted voting scheme, thus by employing different realizations of the learned system dynamics, neural control becomes more reliable by design. An additional strength of the method is that it offers by design a way to estimate future uncertainty, leading to cautious control. While the method aims in general at uncertain systems with complex dynamics, where models derived from first principles are hard to infer, to showcase the application we utilize data gathered in the laboratory from a real mobile manipulator and employ the proposed algorithm for the navigation of the robot in simulation.">

We propose two methods to obtain a fractional score function: fractional score matching (FSM) and score-fPINN for fitting the fractional score function. While FSM is more cost-effective, it relies on known conditional distributions. On the other hand, score-fPINN is independent of specific stochastic differential equations (SDEs) but requires evaluating the PINN model's derivatives, which may be more costly.

        <tr id="Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e.,"steering") the distribution of an ensemble system. In addition, in most of the existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Both linear and nonlinear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide numerical results to validate our theoretical developments.

        <tr id="Deep neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner are proven to be efficient in a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, there is one drawback of end-to-end learning: The learned features and information are implicitly represented in neural network parameters, which cannot be used as regularities, concepts or knowledge to explicitly represent the data probability distribution. To resolve this issue, we propose in this paper a new machine learning theory, which defines in mathematics what are regularities. Briefly, regularities are concise representations of the non-random features, or 'non-randomness' in the data probability distribution. Combining this with information theory, we claim that regularities can also be regarded as a small amount of information encoding a large amount of information. Our theory is based on spiking functions. That is, if a function can react to, or spike on specific data samples more frequently than random noise inputs, we say that such a function discovers non-randomness from the data distribution. Also, we say that the discovered non-randomness is encoded into regularities if the function is simple enough. Our theory also discusses applying multiple spiking functions to the same data distribution. In this process, we claim that the 'best' regularities, or the optimal spiking functions, are those who can capture the largest amount of information from the data distribution, and then encode the captured information in the most concise way. Theorems and hypotheses are provided to describe in mathematics what are 'best' regularities and optimal spiking functions. Finally, we propose a machine learning approach, which can potentially obtain the optimal spiking functions regarding the given dataset in practice.">

Classical techniques suffer from limited applicability or huge computational costs. On the other hand, recent deep learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches often struggle to optimize long-term control sequences under the constraints of system dynamics. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Physical systems Control (DiffPhyCon), a new class of method to address the physical systems control problem. DiffPhyCon excels by simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and identify near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method in 1D Burgers' equation and 2D jellyfish movement control in a fluid environment. Our method outperforms widely applied classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with established findings in the field of fluid dynamics.">

This result considerably generalizes and unifies the results of Morris (2010) and Shinoda (2018), and applies to a wide class of intrinsically ergodic non-Markov symbolic dynamics without Bowen's specification property, including any transitive piecewise monotonic interval map, some coded shifts and multidimensional $\beta$-transformations.

        <tr id="Parameter estimation is one of the central problems in computational modeling of biological systems. Typically, scientists must fully specify the mathematical structure of the model, often expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations, to estimate the parameters. This process poses significant challenges due to the necessity for a detailed understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating model parameters and assessing their identifiability in situations where only partial knowledge of the system structure is available. The partially known model is extended into a system of Hybrid Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, which captures the unknown portions of the system using neural networks. Integrating neural networks into the model structure introduces two primary challenges for parameter estimation: the need to globally explore the search space while employing gradient-based optimization, and the assessment of parameter identifiability, which may be hindered by the expressive nature of neural networks. To overcome the first issue, we treat biological parameters as hyperparameters in the extended model, exploring the parameter search space during hyperparameter tuning. The second issue is then addressed by an a posteriori analysis of parameter identifiability, computed by introducing a variant of a well-established approach for mechanistic models. These two components are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that is thoroughly described in the paper. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on test cases derived from three different benchmark models. These test cases have been designed to mimic real-world conditions, including the presence of noise in the training data and various levels of data availability for the system variables. Author summary Parameter estimation is a central challenge in modeling biological systems. Typically, scientists calibrate the parameters by aligning model predictions with measured data once the model structure is defined. Our paper introduces a workflow that leverages the integration between mechanistic modeling and machine learning to estimate model parameters when the model structure is not fully known. We focus mainly on analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters, which measures how confident we can be in the parameter estimates given the available experimental data and partial mechanistic understanding of the system. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach in various in silico scenarios. Our workflow represents a first step to adapting traditional methods used in fully mechanistic models to the scenario of hybrid modeling.">

To find a proper state space model, an iterative strategy is presented expanding an initial solution in every step. Harnessing only the measurement data and not their time derivatives a criterion is proposed to select promising extensions to the model avoiding extensive simulation studies on possible model structures. Applying a subset selection reduces the complexity of the resulting models and avoids overfitting.

        <tr id="The study of population dynamics originated with early sociological works but has since extended into many fields, including biology, epidemiology, evolutionary game theory, and economics. Most studies on population dynamics focus on the problem of prediction rather than control. Existing mathematical models for control in population dynamics are often restricted to specific, noise-free dynamics, while real-world population changes can be complex and adversarial. To address this gap, we propose a new framework based on the paradigm of online control. We first characterize a set of linear dynamical systems that can naturally model evolving populations. We then give an efficient gradient-based controller for these systems, with near-optimal regret bounds with respect to a broad class of linear policies. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for control in population dynamics even for non-linear models such as SIR and replicator dynamics.">

We aim to solve convex minimization problems by means of stochastic inertial differential equations which are driven by the gradient of the objective function. This will provide a general mathematical framework for analyzing fast optimization algorithms with stochastic gradient input. Our study is a natural extension of our previous work devoted to the first-order in time stochastic steepest descent. Our goal is to develop these results further by considering second-order stochastic differential equations in time, incorporating a viscous time-dependent damping and a Hessian-driven damping. To develop this program, we rely on stochastic Lyapunov analysis. Assuming a square-integrability condition on the diffusion term times a function dependant on the viscous damping, and that the Hessian-driven damping is a positive constant, our first main result shows that almost surely, there is convergence of the values, and states fast convergence of the values in expectation. Besides, in the case where the Hessian-driven damping is zero, we conclude with the fast convergence of the values in expectation and in almost sure sense, we also managed to prove almost sure weak convergence of the trajectory. We provide a comprehensive complexity analysis by establishing several new pointwise and ergodic convergence rates in expectation for the convex and strongly convex case.">

Preconditioners are often necessary to achieve fast convergence When solving these linear systems using iterative solvers. We can use preconditioner updates for closely related systems instead of computing a preconditioner for each system from scratch. One such preconditioner update is the sparse approximate map (SAM), which is based on the sparse approximate inverse preconditioner using a least squares approximation. A SAM then acts as a map from one matrix in the sequence to another nearby one for which we have an effective preconditioner. To efficiently compute an effective SAM update (i.e., one that facilitates fast convergence of the iterative solver), we seek to compute an optimal sparsity pattern. In this paper, we examine several sparsity patterns for computing the SAM update to characterize optimal or near-optimal sparsity patterns for linear systems arising from discretized PDEs.">

        <tr id="Time-series data in real-world settings typically exhibit long-range dependencies and are observed at non-uniform intervals. In these settings, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose \textit{multi-view signature attention}, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.">

We find a simple estimate of the gradient which can be efficiently computed using quantities exposed by popular tree learning libraries. This allows the tools developed in the context of differentiable algorithms, like neural nets and Gaussian processes, to be deployed to tree-based models. To demonstrate this, we study measures of model sensitivity defined in terms of integrals of gradients and demonstrate how to compute them for regression trees using the proposed gradient estimates.

        <tr id="Advancements in machine learning and an abundance of structural monitoring data have inspired the integration of mechanical models with probabilistic models to identify a structure's state and quantify the uncertainty of its physical parameters and response. In this paper, we propose an inference methodology for classical Kirchhoff-Love plates via physics-informed Gaussian Processes (GP). A probabilistic model is formulated as a multi-output GP by placing a GP prior on the deflection and deriving the covariance function using the linear differential operators of the plate governing equations. The posteriors of the flexural rigidity, hyperparameters, and plate response are inferred in a Bayesian manner using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from noisy measurements. We demonstrate the applicability with two examples: a simply supported plate subjected to a sinusoidal load and a fixed plate subjected to a uniform load. The results illustrate how the proposed methodology can be employed to perform stochastic inference for plate rigidity and physical quantities by integrating measurements from various sensor types and qualities. Potential applications of the presented methodology are in structural health monitoring and uncertainty quantification of plate-like structures.">

        <tr id="A fast solution of supersonic flow is one of the crucial challenges in engineering applications of supersonic flight. This article introduces a deep learning framework, the supersonic physics-constrained network (SPC), for the rapid solution of unsteady supersonic flow problems. SPC integrates deep convolutional neural networks with physics-constrained methods based on the Euler equation to derive a new loss function that can accurately calculate the flow fields by considering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow fields at the previous moment. Compared to purely data-driven methods, SPC significantly reduces the dependency on training data volume by incorporating physical constraints. Additionally, the training process of SPC is more stable than that of data-driven methods. Taking the classic supersonic forward step flow as an example, SPC can accurately calculate strong discontinuities in the flow fields, while reducing the data volume by approximately 60%. In the generalization test experiment for forward step flow and compression ramp flow, SPC also demonstrates good predictive accuracy and generalization capability under different geometric configurations and inflow conditions.">

        <tr id="Divergence constraints are present in the governing equations of many physical phenomena, and they usually lead to a Poisson equation whose solution typically is the main bottleneck of many simulation codes. Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) is arguably the most powerful preconditioner for Poisson's equation, and its effectiveness results from the complementary roles played by the smoother, responsible for damping high-frequency error components, and the coarse-grid correction, which in turn reduces low-frequency modes. This work presents several strategies to make AMG more compute-intensive by leveraging reflection, translational and rotational symmetries, often present in academic and industrial configurations. The best-performing method, AMGR, is based on a multigrid reduction framework that introduces an aggressive coarsening to the multigrid hierarchy, reducing the memory footprint, setup and application costs of the top-level smoother. While preserving AMG's excellent convergence, AMGR allows replacing the standard sparse matrix-vector product with the more compute-intensive sparse matrix-matrix product, yielding significant accelerations. Numerical experiments on industrial CFD applications demonstrated up to 70% speed-ups when solving Poisson's equation with AMGR instead of AMG. Additionally, strong and weak scalability analyses revealed no significant degradation.">

To address such discontinuities Aldous introduced the extended weak convergence, which can fully characterise all essential properties, including the filtration, of stochastic processes; however was considered to be hard to find efficient numerical implementations. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric called High Rank PCF Distance (HRPCFD) for extended weak convergence based on the high rank path development method from rough path theory, which also defines the characteristic function for measure-valued processes. We then show that such HRPCFD admits many favourable analytic properties which allows us to design an efficient algorithm for training HRPCFD from data and construct the HRPCF-GAN by using HRPCFD as the discriminator for conditional time series generation. Our numerical experiments on both hypothesis testing and generative modelling validate the out-performance of our approach compared with several state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential in broad applications of synthetic time series generation and in addressing classic financial and economic challenges, such as optimal stopping or utility maximisation problems.">

        <tr id="Learning to represent and simulate the dynamics of physical systems is a crucial yet challenging task. Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.">

However, it is difficult to accurately reproduce the long-term target time series because the reservoir system becomes unstable. This predictive capability is required for a wide variety of time-series processing, including predictions of motor timing and chaotic dynamical systems. This study proposes oscillation-driven reservoir computing (ODRC) with feedback, where oscillatory signals are fed into a reservoir network to stabilize the network activity and induce complex reservoir dynamics. The ODRC can reproduce long-term target time series more accurately than conventional reservoir computing methods in a motor timing and chaotic time-series prediction tasks. Furthermore, it generates a time series similar to the target in the unexperienced period, that is, it can learn the abstract generative rules from limited observations. Given these significant improvements made by the simple and computationally inexpensive implementation, the ODRC would serve as a practical model of various time series data. Moreover, we will discuss biological implications of the ODRC, considering it as a model of neural oscillations and their cerebellar processors.">

Unfortunately, the problem is generally ill-posed due to the possible presence of unknown delays in the measurements. In this paper, we offer a solution of this problem by using a variational Bayes framework, where the uncertainty over the delays is marginalized in order to obtain conservative coupling estimates. To overcome the well-known overconfidence of classical variational methods, we use a hybrid-VI scheme where the (possibly flat or multimodal) posterior over the measurement parameters is estimated using a forward KL loss while the (nearly convex) conditional posterior over the couplings is estimated using the highly scalable gradient-based VI. In our ground-truth experiments, we show that the network provides reliable and conservative estimates of the couplings, greatly outperforming similar methods such as regression DCM.">

        <tr id="Schr\"odinger bridge is a diffusion process that steers a given distribution to another in a prescribed time while minimizing the effort to do so. It can be seen as the stochastic dynamical version of the optimal mass transport, and has growing applications in generative diffusion models and stochastic optimal control. In this work, we propose a regularized variant of the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go that incentivizes the optimal sample paths to stay close to a nominal level. Unlike the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge, the regularization induces a state-dependent rate of killing and creation of probability mass, and its solution requires determining the Markov kernel of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. We derive this Markov kernel in closed form. Our solution recovers the heat kernel in the vanishing regularization (i.e., diffusion without reaction) limit, thereby recovering the solution of the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge. Our results enable the use of dynamic Sinkhorn recursion for computing the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go, which would otherwise be challenging to use in this setting. We deduce properties of the new kernel and explain its connections with certain exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics.">

        <tr id="The affinity graph is regarded as a mathematical representation of the local manifold structure. The performance of locality-preserving projections (LPPs) and its variants is tied to the quality of the affinity graph. However, there are two drawbacks in current approaches. First, the pre-designed graph is inconsistent with the actual distribution of data. Second, the linear projection way would cause damage to the nonlinear manifold structure. In this article, we propose a nonlinear dimensionality reduction model, named deep locality-preserving projections (DLPPs), to solve these problems simultaneously. The model consists of two loss functions, each employing deep autoencoders (AEs) to extract discriminative features. In the first loss function, the affinity relationships among samples in the intermediate layer are determined adaptively according to the distances between samples. Since the features of samples are obtained by nonlinear mapping, the manifold structure can be kept in the low-dimensional space. Additionally, the learned affinity graph is able to avoid the influence of noisy and redundant features. In the second loss function, the affinity relationships among samples in the last layer (also called the reconstruction layer) are learned. This strategy enables denoised samples to have a good manifold structure. By integrating these two functions, our proposed model minimizes the mismatch of the manifold structure between samples in the denoising space and the low-dimensional space, while reducing sensitivity to the initial weights of the graph. Extensive experiments on toy and benchmark datasets have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed model.">

We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.">

Our approach utilizes gradient boosting for estimation, providing a model-free, nonlinear analysis able to handle large-dimensional systems while requiring minimal or no calibration. Our procedure is divided into three phases: trajectory encoding, Markovian order identification, and hypothesis testing for variable interactions. The latter is the key innovation that allows us to selectively switch off variable interactions to discern their specific contribution to irreversibility. When applied to financial markets, our findings reveal a distinctive shift: during stable periods, irreversibility is mainly related to short-term patterns, whereas in unstable periods, these short-term patterns are disrupted, leaving only contributions from stable long-term ones. This observed transition underscores the crucial importance of high-order variable interactions in understanding the dynamics of financial markets, especially in times of turbulence.">

It is based on a multiscale operator transformer, with time-conditioned layer norms that enable continuous-in-time evaluations. A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is then evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results showcase the surprising ability of Poseidon to learn effective representations from a very small set of PDEs during pretraining in order to generalize well to unseen and unrelated PDEs downstream, demonstrating its potential as an effective, general purpose PDE foundation model. Finally, the Poseidon model as well as underlying pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced, with code being available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/poseidon and pretrained models and datasets at https://huggingface.co/camlab-ethz.">

        <tr id="This paper presents two models of neural-networks and their training applicable to neural networks of arbitrary width, depth and topology, assuming only finite-energy neural activations; and a novel representor theory for neural networks in terms of a matrix-valued kernel. The first model is exact (un-approximated) and global, casting the neural network as an elements in a reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS); we use this model to provide tight bounds on Rademacher complexity. The second model is exact and local, casting the change in neural network function resulting from a bounded change in weights and biases (ie. a training step) in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in terms of a local-intrinsic neural kernel (LiNK). This local model provides insight into model adaptation through tight bounds on Rademacher complexity of network adaptation. We also prove that the neural tangent kernel (NTK) is a first-order approximation of the LiNK kernel. Finally, and noting that the LiNK does not provide a representor theory for technical reasons, we present an exact novel representor theory for layer-wise neural network training with unregularized gradient descent in terms of a local-extrinsic neural kernel (LeNK). This representor theory gives insight into the role of higher-order statistics in neural network training and the effect of kernel evolution in neural-network kernel models. Throughout the paper (a) feedforward ReLU networks and (b) residual networks (ResNet) are used as illustrative examples.">

        <tr id="General first order methods (GFOMs), including various gradient descent and AMP algorithms, constitute a broad class of iterative algorithms in modern statistical learning problems. Some GFOMs also serve as constructive proof devices, iteratively characterizing the empirical distributions of statistical estimators in the large system limits for any fixed number of iterations. This paper develops a non-asymptotic, entrywise characterization for a general class of GFOMs. Our characterizations capture the precise entrywise behavior of the GFOMs, and hold universally across a broad class of heterogeneous random matrix models. As a corollary, we provide the first non-asymptotic description of the empirical distributions of the GFOMs beyond Gaussian ensembles. We demonstrate the utility of these general results in two applications. In the first application, we prove entrywise universality for regularized least squares estimators in the linear model, by controlling the entrywise error relative to a suitably constructed GFOM. This algorithmic proof method also leads to systematically improved averaged universality results for regularized regression estimators in the linear model, and resolves the universality conjecture for (regularized) MLEs in logistic regression. In the second application, we obtain entrywise Gaussian approximations for a class of gradient descent algorithms. Our approach provides non-asymptotic state evolution for the bias and variance of the algorithm along the iteration path, applicable for non-convex loss functions. The proof relies on a new recursive leave-k-out method that provides almost delocalization for the GFOMs and their derivatives. Crucially, our method ensures entrywise universality for up to poly-logarithmic many iterations, which facilitates effective $\ell_2/\ell_\infty$ control between certain GFOMs and statistical estimators in applications.">

Despite the progress in deep learning for time series analysis, there remains a challenge in addressing the non-stationary nature of time series data. Traditional models, which are built on the assumption of constant statistical properties over time, often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics in realistic time series, resulting in bias and error in time series analysis. This paper introduces the Adaptive Wavelet Network (AdaWaveNet), a novel approach that employs Adaptive Wavelet Transformation for multi-scale analysis of non-stationary time series data. AdaWaveNet designed a lifting scheme-based wavelet decomposition and construction mechanism for adaptive and learnable wavelet transforms, which offers enhanced flexibility and robustness in analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 datasets across 3 different tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and a newly established super-resolution task. The evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaWaveNet over existing methods in all three tasks, which illustrates its potential in various real-world applications.">

        <tr id="Ridgeless regression has garnered attention among researchers, particularly in light of the ``Benign Overfitting'' phenomenon, where models interpolating noisy samples demonstrate robust generalization. However, kernel ridgeless regression does not always perform well due to the lack of flexibility. This paper enhances kernel ridgeless regression with Locally-Adaptive-Bandwidths (LAB) RBF kernels, incorporating kernel learning techniques to improve performance in both experiments and theory. For the first time, we demonstrate that functions learned from LAB RBF kernels belong to an integral space of Reproducible Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs). Despite the absence of explicit regularization in the proposed model, its optimization is equivalent to solving an $\ell_0$-regularized problem in the integral space of RKHSs, elucidating the origin of its generalization ability. Taking an approximation analysis viewpoint, we introduce an $l_q$-norm analysis technique (with $0<q<1$) to derive the learning rate for the proposed model under mild conditions. This result deepens our theoretical understanding, explaining that our algorithm's robust approximation ability arises from the large capacity of the integral space of RKHSs, while its generalization ability is ensured by sparsity, controlled by the number of support vectors. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets validate our theoretical conclusions.">

        <tr id="Complex phenomena can be better understood when broken down into a limited number of simpler"components". Linear statistical methods such as the principal component analysis and its variants are widely used across various fields of applied science to identify and rank these components based on the variance they represent in the data. These methods can be seen as factorizations of the matrix collecting all the data, which are assumed to be a collection of time series sampled from fixed points in space. However, when data sampling locations vary over time, as with mobile monitoring stations in meteorology and oceanography or with particle tracking velocimetry in experimental fluid dynamics, advanced interpolation techniques are required to project the data onto a fixed grid before carrying out the factorization. This interpolation is often expensive and inaccurate. This work proposes a method to decompose scattered data without interpolating. The approach is based on physics-constrained radial basis function regression to compute inner products in space and time. The method provides an analytical and mesh-independent decomposition in space and time, demonstrating higher accuracy than the traditional approach. Our results show that it is possible to distill the most relevant"components"even for measurements whose natural output is a distribution of data scattered in space and time, maintaining high accuracy and mesh independence.">

        <tr id="Physical learning is an emerging paradigm in science and engineering whereby (meta)materials acquire desired macroscopic behaviors by exposure to examples. So far, it has been applied to static properties such as elastic moduli and self-assembled structures encoded in minima of an energy landscape. Here, we extend this paradigm to dynamic functionalities, such as motion and shape change, that are instead encoded in limit cycles or pathways of a dynamical system. We identify the two ingredients needed to learn time-dependent behaviors irrespective of experimental platforms: (i) learning rules with time delays and (ii) exposure to examples that break time-reversal symmetry during training. After providing a hands-on demonstration of these requirements using programmable LEGO toys, we turn to realistic particle-based simulations where the training rules are not programmed on a computer. Instead, we elucidate how they emerge from physico-chemical processes involving the causal propagation of fields, like in recent experiments on moving oil droplets with chemotactic signalling. Our trainable particles can self-assemble into structures that move or change shape on demand, either by retrieving the dynamic behavior previously seen during training, or by learning on the fly. This rich phenomenology is captured by a modified Hopfield spin model amenable to analytical treatment. The principles illustrated here provide a step towards von Neumann's dream of engineering synthetic living systems that adapt to the environment.">

However, existing methods for FPCA do not apply when functional observations are truncated, e.g., the measurement instrument only supports recordings within a pre-specified interval, thereby truncating values outside of the range to the nearest boundary. A naive application of existing methods without correction for truncation induces bias. We extend the FPCA framework to accommodate truncated noisy functional data by first recovering smooth mean and covariance surface estimates that are representative of the latent process's mean and covariance functions. Unlike traditional sample covariance smoothing techniques, our procedure yields a positive semi-definite covariance surface, computed without the need to retroactively remove negative eigenvalues in the covariance operator decomposition. Additionally, we construct a FPC score predictor and demonstrate its use in the generalized functional linear model. Convergence rates for the proposed estimators are provided. In simulation experiments, the proposed method yields better predictive performance and lower bias than existing alternatives. We illustrate its practical value through an application to a study with truncated blood glucose measurements.">

        <tr id="Differentiable optimization is a powerful new paradigm capable of reconciling model-based and learning-based approaches in robotics. However, the majority of robotics optimization problems are non-convex and current differentiable optimization techniques are therefore prone to convergence to local minima. When this occurs, the gradients provided by these existing solvers can be wildly inaccurate and will ultimately corrupt the training process. On the other hand, many non-convex robotics problems can be framed as polynomial optimization problems and, in turn, admit convex relaxations that can be used to recover a global solution via so-called certifiably correct methods. We present SDPRLayers, an approach that leverages these methods as well as state-of-the-art convex implicit differentiation techniques to provide certifiably correct gradients throughout the training process. We introduce this approach and showcase theoretical results that provide conditions under which correctness of the gradients is guaranteed. We first demonstrate our approach on two simple-but-demonstrative simulated examples, which expose the potential pitfalls of existing, state-of-the-art, differentiable optimization methods. We then apply our method in a real-world application: we train a deep neural network to detect image keypoints for robot localization in challenging lighting conditions.

        <tr id="A persistent challenge in tasks involving large-scale dynamical systems, such as state estimation and error reduction, revolves around processing the collected measurements. Frequently, these data suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased computational demands in data processing methodologies. Recent scholarly investigations have underscored the utility of delineating collective states and dynamics via moment-based representations. These representations serve as a form of sufficient statistics for encapsulating collective characteristics, while simultaneously permitting the retrieval of individual data points. In this paper, we reshape the Kalman filter methodology, aiming its application in the moment domain of an ensemble system and developing the basis for moment ensemble noise filtering. The moment system is defined with respect to the normalized Legendre polynomials, and it is shown that its orthogonal basis structure introduces unique benefits for the application of Kalman filter for both i.i.d. and universal Gaussian disturbances. The proposed method thrives from the reduction in problem dimension, which is unbounded within the state-space representation, and can achieve significantly smaller values when converted to the truncated moment-space. Furthermore, the robustness of moment data toward outliers and localized inaccuracies is an additional positive aspect of this approach. The methodology is applied for an ensemble of harmonic oscillators and units following aircraft dynamics, with results showcasing a reduction in both cumulative absolute error and covariance with reduced calculation cost due to the realization of operations within the moment framework conceived.">

While computational fluid dynamics is precise, it is computationally impractical for real-time control. Lumped thermal models divide the room into cells and explicitly model inter-cell air-mixing. However, solving the coupled differential equations is still computationally challenging. Data-driven methods like long-short term memory may handle non-linear thermal dynamics but face limitations in observability, adherence to physical constraints, and generalization. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) impose physical constraints even while learning from data. However, PINNs still lack the scalability required for effective control in large open-plan offices, primarily due to air-mixing interactions Our approach, PhyGICS, combines graph neural networks with physics-informed learning (PI-GNN) to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we model the thermodynamic interactions as edges between nodes that represent cells. Further, the modeling approach allows explicit modeling of wall and window surface temperatures that are commonly ignored. PhyGICS, utilizing PI-GNN as a state-estimator, employs a receding-horizon approach for optimal HVAC control. We adapt PI-GNNs for building HVAC control by incorporating a time-resetting strategy to handle time-dependent ambient conditions and therefore set-points. Evaluations in a simulated environment with real-world data show PhyGICS outperforms a regular PINN model and other baseline control strategies on: 1) thermal model accuracy; 2) computation time; 3) energy consumption; and 4) user comfort.">

        <tr id="In addition to their importance in statistical thermodynamics, probabilistic entropy measurements are crucial for understanding and analyzing complex systems, with diverse applications in time series and one-dimensional profiles. However, extending these methods to two- and three-dimensional data still requires further development. In this study, we present a new method for classifying spatiotemporal processes based on entropy measurements. To test and validate the method, we selected five classes of similar processes related to the evolution of random patterns: (i) white noise; (ii) red noise; (iii) weak turbulence from reaction to diffusion; (iv) hydrodynamic fully developed turbulence; and (v) plasma turbulence from MHD. Considering seven possible ways to measure entropy from a matrix, we present the method as a parameter space composed of the two best separating measures of the five selected classes. The results highlight better combined performance of Shannon permutation entropy (SHp) and a new approach based on Tsallis Spectral Permutation Entropy (Sqs). Notably, our observations reveal the segregation of reaction terms in this SHp×Sqs space, a result that identifies specific sectors for each class of dynamic process, and it can be used to train machine learning models for the automatic classification of complex spatiotemporal patterns.">

We then identify a set of sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of pathwise gradients of solution trajectories and event times with respect to the network's parameters and show how these gradients satisfy a recursive relation. Furthermore, we introduce a general-purpose loss function defined by means of a new class of signature kernels indexed on c\`adl\`ag rough paths and use it to train SSNNs as generative models. We provide an end-to-end autodifferentiable solver for Event SDEs and make its implementation available as part of the $\texttt{diffrax}$ library.

This capability is essential for ensuring the safe operation of bridges and preventing sudden catastrophic failures. However, FEM computational cost and the need for realtime analysis pose significant challenges. Additionally, the input data is a 7 dimensional vector, while the output is a 1017 dimensional vector, making accurate and efficient analysis particularly difficult. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum classical Multilayer Perceptron pipeline leveraging Symmetric Positive Definite matrices and Riemannian manifolds for effective data representation. To maintain the integrity of the qubit structure, we utilize SPD matrices, ensuring data representation is well aligned with the quantum computational framework. Additionally, the method leverages polynomial feature expansion to capture nonlinear relationships within the data. The proposed pipeline combines classical fully connected neural network layers with quantum circuit layers to enhance model performance and efficiency. Our experiments focused on various configurations of such hybrid models to identify the optimal structure for accurate and efficient realtime analysis. The best performing model achieved a Mean Squared Error of 0.00031, significantly outperforming traditional methods.">

        <tr id="Subspace clustering (SC) algorithms utilize the union of subspaces model to cluster data points according to the subspaces from which they are drawn. To better address separability of subspaces and robustness to noise we propose a wavelet packet (WP) based transform domain subspace clustering. Depending on the number of resolution levels, WP yields several representations instantiated in terms of subbands. The first approach combines original and subband data into one complementary multi-view representation. Afterward, we formulate joint representation learning as a low-rank MERA tensor network approximation problem. That is motivated by the strong representation power of the MERA network to capture complex intra/inter-view dependencies in corresponding self-representation tensor. In the second approach, we use a self-stopping computationally efficient method to select the subband with the smallest clustering error on the validation set. When existing SC algorithms are applied to the chosen subband, their performance is expected to improve. Consequently, both approaches enable the re-use of SC algorithms developed so far. Improved clustering performance is due to the dual nature of subbands as representations and filters, which is essential for noise suppression. We exemplify the proposed WP domain approach to SC on the MERA tensor network and eight other well-known linear SC algorithms using six well-known image datasets representing faces, digits, and objects. Although WP domain-based SC is a linear method, it achieved clustering performance comparable with some best deep SC algorithms and outperformed many other deep SC algorithms by a significant margin. That is in particular case for the WP MERA SC algorithm. On the COIL100 dataset, it achieves an accuracy of 87.45% and outperforms the best deep SC competitor in the amount of 14.75%.">

We design an accelerated dual-integral structure zeroing neural network (ADISZNN), which can enhance convergence and restrict linear noise, particularly in complex domains. Based on the Lyapunov principle, theoretical analysis proves the convergence and robustness of ADISZNN. We have selectively integrated the SBPAF activation function, and through theoretical dissection and comparative experimental validation we have affirmed the efficacy and accuracy of our activation function selection strategy. After conducting numerous experiments, we discovered oscillations and improved the model accordingly, resulting in the ADISZNN-Stable model.

A grammar-guided genetic programming (G3P) combined with l 0 sparse regression is applied with two different variants of grammar to automatically construct a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model of different forms, termed extended and polynomial models. The proposed method is compared with a linear parameter-varying ARX (LPV-ARX) model. Identification is performed on experimental data ob - tained from a laboratory-scale overhead crane. The identified models are compared in terms of prediction accuracy, model’s complexity measured using number of model terms, and execution time. The regularized G3P method outperformed the LPV-ARX model in terms of model predictive output accuracy. The G3P with the extended gram - mar resulted in more accurate crane velocity prediction models than the models with the polynomial grammar. The payload sway prediction model with the polynomial grammar was less complex in all measured metrics while there was no statistical significance in the accuracy when compared to the models with extended grammar.">

        <tr id="In this manuscript, we introduce a novel parametric family of multistep iterative methods designed to solve nonlinear equations. This family is derived from a damped Newton’s scheme but includes an additional Newton step with a weight function and a “frozen” derivative, that is, the same derivative than in the previous step. Initially, we develop a quad-parametric class with a first-order convergence rate. Subsequently, by restricting one of its parameters, we accelerate the convergence to achieve a third-order uni-parametric family. We thoroughly investigate the convergence properties of this final class of iterative methods, assess its stability through dynamical tools, and evaluate its performance on a set of test problems. We conclude that there exists one optimal fourth-order member of this class, in the sense of Kung–Traub’s conjecture. Our analysis includes stability surfaces and dynamical planes, revealing the intricate nature of this family. Notably, our exploration of stability surfaces enables the identification of specific family members suitable for scalar functions with a challenging convergence behavior, as they may exhibit periodical orbits and fixed points with attracting behavior in their corresponding dynamical planes. Furthermore, our dynamical study finds members of the family of iterative methods with exceptional stability. This property allows us to converge to the solution of practical problem-solving applications even from initial estimations very far from the solution. We confirm our findings with various numerical tests, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of the presented family of iterative methods.">

        <tr id="Many problems in Physics and Chemistry are formulated as the minimization of a functional. Therefore, methods for solving these problems typically require differentiating maps whose input and/or output are functions -- commonly referred to as variational differentiation. Such maps are not addressed at the mathematical level by the chain rule, which underlies modern symbolic and algorithmic differentiation (AD) systems. Although there are algorithmic solutions such as tracing and reverse accumulation, they do not provide human readability and introduce strict programming constraints that bottleneck performance, especially in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. In this manuscript, we propose a new computer theoretic model of differentiation by combining the pullback of the $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{C}$ combinators from the combinatory logic. Unlike frameworks based on the chain rule, this model differentiates a minimal complete basis for the space of computable functions. Consequently, the model is capable of analytic backpropagation and variational differentiation while supporting complex numbers. To demonstrate the generality of this approach we build a system named CombDiff, which can differentiate nontrivial variational problems such as Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and multilayer perceptrons.">

        <tr id="Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, more data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalizable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than the neural network alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularization, penalizing biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularization not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularization reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses. Author summary Systems biology concerns the modelling and analysis of biological processes, by viewing these as interconnected systems. Modelling is typically done either using mechanistic differential equations that are derived from experiments and known biology, or using machine learning on large biological datasets. While mathematical modelling from biological experiments can provide useful insights with limited data, building and validating these models takes a long time and often requires highly invasive measurements in humans. Efforts to combine this classical technique with machine learning have resulted in a framework termed universal differential equations, where the model equations contain a neural network to describe unknown biological interactions. While these methods have shown success in numerous fields, applications in biology are more challenging due to limited data-availability, high data sparsity. In this work, we have introduced physiology-informed regularization to overcome these instabilities and to constrain the model to biologically plausible behavior. Our results show that by using physiology-informed regularization, we can accurately predict future unseen observations in a simulated example, with much more limited data than a similar model without regularization. Additionally, we show an application of this technique on human data, applying a neural network to learn the appearance of glucose in the blood plasma after a meal.">

        <tr id="Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA) is a latent variable modeling technique commonly used to identify smooth, low-dimensional latent trajectories underlying high-dimensional neural recordings. Specifically, researchers model spiking rates as Gaussian observations, resulting in tractable inference. Recently, GPFA has been extended to model spike count data. However, due to the non-conjugacy of the likelihood, the inference becomes intractable. Prior works rely on either black-box inference techniques, numerical integration or polynomial approximations of the likelihood to handle intractability. To overcome this challenge, we propose a conditionally-conjugate Gaussian process factor analysis (ccGPFA) resulting in both analytically and computationally tractable inference for modeling neural activity from spike count data. In particular, we develop a novel data augmentation based method that renders the model conditionally conjugate. Consequently, our model enjoys the advantage of simple closed-form updates using a variational EM algorithm. Furthermore, due to its conditional conjugacy, we show our model can be readily scaled using sparse Gaussian Processes and accelerated inference via natural gradients. To validate our method, we empirically demonstrate its efficacy through experiments.">

Due to its low dimensionality, its analytical and numerical tractability, and its neuronal interpretation, it has been used as a case study to test the performance of different statistical methods in estimating the underlying model parameters. Existing methods, however, often require complete observations, non-degeneracy of the noise or a complex architecture (e.g., to estimate the transition density of the process,"recovering"the unobserved second component), and they may not (satisfactorily) estimate all model parameters simultaneously. Moreover, these studies lack real data applications for the stochastic FHN model. Here, we tackle all challenges (non-globally Lipschitz drift, non-explicit solution, lack of available transition density, degeneracy of the noise, and partial observations) via an intuitive and easy-to-implement sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm. The proposed method relies on a recent computationally efficient and structure-preserving numerical splitting scheme for synthetic data generation, and on summary statistics exploiting the structural properties of the process. We succeed in estimating all model parameters from simulated data and, more remarkably, real action potential data of rats.

        <tr id="Curvature information -- particularly, the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian, known as the sharpness -- often forms the basis for learning rate tuners. However, recent work has shown that the curvature information undergoes complex dynamics during training, going from a phase of increasing sharpness to eventual stabilization. We analyze the closed-loop feedback effect between learning rate tuning and curvature. We find that classical learning rate tuners may yield greater one-step loss reduction, yet they ultimately underperform in the long term when compared to constant learning rates in the full batch regime. These models break the stabilization of the sharpness, which we explain using a simplified model of the joint dynamics of the learning rate and the curvature. To further investigate these effects, we introduce a new learning rate tuning method, Curvature Dynamics Aware Tuning (CDAT), which prioritizes long term curvature stabilization over instantaneous progress on the objective. In the full batch regime, CDAT shows behavior akin to prefixed warm-up schedules on deep learning objectives, outperforming tuned constant learning rates. In the mini batch regime, we observe that stochasticity introduces confounding effects that explain the previous success of some learning rate tuners at appropriate batch sizes. Our findings highlight the critical role of understanding the joint dynamics of the learning rate and curvature, beyond greedy minimization, to diagnose failures and design effective adaptive learning rate tuners.">

        <tr id="Global polynomial optimization is an important tool across applied mathematics, with many applications in operations research, engineering, and physical sciences. In various settings, the polynomials depend on external parameters that may be random. We discuss a stochastic sum-of-squares (S-SOS) algorithm based on the sum-of squares hierarchy that constructs a series of semidefinite programs to jointly find strict lower bounds on the global minimum and extract candidates for parameterized global minimizers. We prove quantitative convergence of the hierarchy as the degree increases and use it to solve unconstrained and constrained polynomial optimization problems parameterized by random variables. By employing $n$-body priors from condensed matter physics to induce sparsity, we can use S-SOS to produce solutions and uncertainty intervals for sensor network localization problems containing up to 40 variables and semidefinite matrix sizes surpassing $800 \times 800$.">
