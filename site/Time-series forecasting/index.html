        <tr id="Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.">

        <tr id="In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different time points. Here, we introduce RAINDROP, a graph neural network that embeds irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. RAINDROP represents every sample as a separate sensor graph and models time-varying dependencies between sensors with a novel message passing operator. It estimates the latent sensor graph structure and leverages the structure together with nearby observations to predict misaligned readouts. This model can be interpreted as a graph neural network that sends messages over graphs that are optimized for capturing time-varying dependencies among sensors. We use RAINDROP to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. RAINDROP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.4% (absolute F1-score points), including techniques that deal with irregular sampling using fixed discretization and set functions. RAINDROP shows superiority in diverse setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have shown to be effective in time series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global) inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate predictions.">

        <tr id="Outstanding achievements of graph neural networks for spatiotemporal time series analysis show that relational constraints introduce an effective inductive bias into neural forecasting architectures. Often, however, the relational information characterizing the underlying data-generating process is unavailable and the practitioner is left with the problem of inferring from data which relational graph to use in the subsequent processing stages. We propose novel, principled - yet practical - probabilistic score-based methods that learn the relational dependencies as distributions over graphs while maximizing end-to-end the performance at task. The proposed graph learning framework is based on consolidated variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo score-based gradient estimation, is theoretically grounded, and, as we show, effective in practice. In this paper, we focus on the time series forecasting problem and show that, by tailoring the gradient estimators to the graph learning problem, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance while controlling the sparsity of the learned graph and the computational scalability. We empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that the proposed solution can be used as a stand-alone graph identification procedure as well as a graph learning component of an end-to-end forecasting architecture.">

        <tr id="Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic) graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed, recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions.">

        <tr id="By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.">

        <tr id="Attention mechanisms have been widely used to capture long-range dependencies among nodes in Graph Transformers. Bottlenecked by the quadratic computational cost, attention mechanisms fail to scale in large graphs. Recent improvements in computational efficiency are mainly achieved by attention sparsification with random or heuristic-based graph subsampling, which falls short in data-dependent context reasoning. State space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained prominence for their effectiveness and efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, adapting SSMs to non-sequential graph data presents a notable challenge. In this work, we introduce Graph-Mamba, the first attempt to enhance long-range context modeling in graph networks by integrating a Mamba block with the input-dependent node selection mechanism. Specifically, we formulate graph-centric node prioritization and permutation strategies to enhance context-aware reasoning, leading to a substantial improvement in predictive performance. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-range graph prediction tasks, with a fraction of the computational cost in both FLOPs and GPU memory consumption. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/Graph-Mamba.">

        <tr id="Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.">

        <tr id="Large pre-trained models excel in zero/few-shot learning for language and vision tasks but face challenges in multivariate time series (TS) forecasting due to diverse data characteristics. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1. Model weights for more sophisticated variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, and TTM-A) will be shared soon.

        <tr id="Pre-training on time series poses a unique challenge due to the potential mismatch between pre-training and target domains, such as shifts in temporal dynamics, fast-evolving trends, and long-range and short-cyclic effects, which can lead to poor downstream performance. While domain adaptation methods can mitigate these shifts, most methods need examples directly from the target domain, making them suboptimal for pre-training. To address this challenge, methods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and be capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training. Relative to other modalities, in time series, we expect that time-based and frequency-based representations of the same example are located close together in the time-frequency space. To this end, we posit that time-frequency consistency (TF-C) -- embedding a time-based neighborhood of an example close to its frequency-based neighborhood -- is desirable for pre-training. Motivated by TF-C, we define a decomposable pre-training model, where the self-supervised signal is provided by the distance between time and frequency components, each individually trained by contrastive estimation. We evaluate the new method on eight datasets, including electrodiagnostic testing, human activity recognition, mechanical fault detection, and physical status monitoring. Experiments against eight state-of-the-art methods show that TF-C outperforms baselines by 15.4% (F1 score) on average in one-to-one settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model on EMG data) and by 8.4% (precision) in challenging one-to-many settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model for either hand-gesture recognition or mechanical fault prediction), reflecting the breadth of scenarios that arise in real-world applications.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that Raincoat can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.">

The proposed AZ-test can be intended as a spatio-temporal extension of traditional tests designed for system identiﬁcation to graph signals. The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes over time, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as it is the case in many application scenarios like sensor and transportation networks. The asymptotic distribution of the designed test can be derived under the null hypothesis without assuming identically distributed data. We show the effectiveness of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and illustrate how it can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graph stream.">

Within this framework, relational inductive biases, e.g., associated with functional dependencies existing among signals, are not explicitly exploited leaving unattended great opportunities for effective modeling approaches. The manuscript aims, for the first time, at filling this gap by matching state-space modeling and spatio-temporal data where the relational information, say the functional graph capturing latent dependencies, is learned directly from data and is allowed to change over time. Within a probabilistic formulation that accounts for the uncertainty in the data-generating process, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn the state-space model end-to-end on a downstream task.

        <tr id="Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.">

Additionally, our approach leverages related past experiences for similar input time series to efficiently handle both intra-series and inter-series dependencies of non-stationary data with a time-then-space modeling approach, using grouped-query attention, while mitigating the limitations of traditional forecasting techniques in handling distributional shifts. Our approach models predictive uncertainty to improve decision-making. Our framework enables on-premises customization with reduced computational and memory demands, while maintaining inference speed and data privacy/security.

However, most of these models are designed to handle short univariate time series as an input. This limits their practical use, especially in domains such as healthcare with copious amounts of long and multivariate data with strong temporal and intra-variate dependencies. Our study bridges this gap by cataloging and systematically comparing various context expansion techniques from both language and time series domains, and introducing a novel compressive memory mechanism to allow encoder-only TSFMs to effectively model intra-variate dependencies.

        <tr id="With recent advances in building foundation models for texts and video data, there is a surge of interest in foundation models for time series. A family of models have been developed, utilizing a temporal auto-regressive generative Transformer architecture, whose effectiveness has been proven in Large Language Models. While the empirical results are promising, almost all existing time series foundation models have only been tested on well-curated ``benchmark'' datasets very similar to texts. However, real-world time series exhibit unique challenges, such as variable channel sizes across domains, missing values, and varying signal sampling intervals due to the multi-resolution nature of real-world data. Additionally, the uni-directional nature of temporally auto-regressive decoding limits the incorporation of domain knowledge, such as physical laws expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these challenges, we introduce the Time Diffusion Transformer (TimeDiT), a general foundation model for time series that employs a denoising diffusion paradigm instead of temporal auto-regressive generation. TimeDiT leverages the Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies and employs diffusion processes to generate high-quality candidate samples without imposing stringent assumptions on the target distribution via novel masking schemes and a channel alignment strategy. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning-free model editing strategy that allows the seamless integration of external knowledge during the sampling process without updating any model parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on a varity of tasks such as forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of TimeDiT.">

        <tr id="Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either fine-tune large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time-series datasets to develop TSF foundation models. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich and high-quality natural images, based on the intrinsic similarities between images and time series. To bridge the gap between the two domains, we reformulate the TSF task as an image reconstruction task, which is further processed by a visual masked autoencoder (MAE) self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With minimal fine-tuning, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. These findings suggest that visual models could be a free lunch for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-domain research between computer vision and TSF.

        <tr id="The self-attention mechanism in Transformer architecture, invariant to sequence order, necessitates positional embeddings to encode temporal order in time series prediction. We argue that this reliance on positional embeddings restricts the Transformer's ability to effectively represent temporal sequences, particularly when employing longer lookback windows. To address this, we introduce an innovative approach that combines Pyramid RNN embeddings(PRE) for univariate time series with the Transformer's capability to model multivariate dependencies. PRE, utilizing pyramidal one-dimensional convolutional layers, constructs multiscale convolutional features that preserve temporal order. Additionally, RNNs, layered atop these features, learn multiscale time series representations sensitive to sequence order. This integration into Transformer models with attention mechanisms results in significant performance enhancements. We present the PRformer, a model integrating PRE with a standard Transformer encoder, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets.

        <tr id="Time-series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the introduction of token prediction mechanisms such as multi-head attention. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the same performance as in language modeling, primarily due to the quadratic computational cost and the complexity of capturing long-range dependencies in time-series data. State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have shown promise in addressing these challenges by offering efficient solutions with linear RNNs capable of modeling long sequences with larger context windows. However, there remains room for improvement in accuracy and scalability. We propose the use of Test-Time Training (TTT) modules in a parallel architecture to enhance performance in long-term time series forecasting. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that TTT modules consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including the Mamba-based TimeMachine, particularly in scenarios involving extended sequence and prediction lengths. Our results show significant improvements in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), especially on larger datasets such as Electricity, Traffic, and Weather, underscoring the effectiveness of TTT in capturing long-range dependencies. Additionally, we explore various convolutional architectures within the TTT framework, showing that even simple configurations like 1D convolution with small filters can achieve competitive results.

        <tr id="Recently many deep learning models have been proposed for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Based on previous literature, we identify three critical patterns that can improve forecasting accuracy: the order and semantic dependencies in time dimension as well as cross-variate dependency. However, little effort has been made to simultaneously consider order and semantic dependencies when developing forecasting models. Moreover, existing approaches utilize cross-variate dependency by mixing information from different timestamps and variates, which may introduce irrelevant or harmful cross-variate information to the time dimension and largely hinder forecasting performance. To overcome these limitations, we investigate the potential of Mamba for LTSF and discover two key advantages benefiting forecasting: (i) the selection mechanism makes Mamba focus on or ignore specific inputs and learn semantic dependency easily, and (ii) Mamba preserves order dependency by processing sequences recursively. After that, we empirically find that the non-linear activation used in Mamba is unnecessary for semantically sparse time series data. Therefore, we further propose SAMBA, a Simplified Mamba with disentangled dependency encoding. Specifically, we first remove the non-linearities of Mamba to make it more suitable for LTSF. Furthermore, we propose a disentangled dependency encoding strategy to endow Mamba with cross-variate dependency modeling capabilities while reducing the interference between time and variate dimensions. Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SAMBA over state-of-the-art forecasting models.">

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have brought new ways to improve these predictions. While recent financial large language models (FinLLMs) have shown considerable progress in financial NLP tasks compared to smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs), challenges persist in stock price forecasting. Firstly, effectively integrating the modalities of time series data and natural language to fully leverage these capabilities remains complex. Secondly, FinLLMs focus more on analysis and interpretability, which can overlook the essential features of time series data. Moreover, due to the abundance of false and redundant information in financial markets, models often produce less accurate predictions when faced with such input data. In this paper, we introduce StockTime, a novel LLM-based architecture designed specifically for stock price data. Unlike recent FinLLMs, StockTime is specifically designed for stock price time series data. It leverages the natural ability of LLMs to predict the next token by treating stock prices as consecutive tokens, extracting textual information such as stock correlations, statistical trends and timestamps directly from these stock prices. StockTime then integrates both textual and time series data into the embedding space. By fusing this multimodal data, StockTime effectively predicts stock prices across arbitrary look-back periods. Our experiments demonstrate that StockTime outperforms recent LLMs, as it gives more accurate predictions while reducing memory usage and runtime costs.">

        <tr id="Deep models for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting have recently demonstrated significant success. Channel-dependent models capture complex dependencies that channel-independent models cannot capture. However, the number of channels in real-world applications outpaces the capabilities of existing channel-dependent models, and contrary to common expectations, some models underperform the channel-independent models in handling high-dimensional data, which raises questions about the performance of channel-dependent models. To address this, our study first investigates the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of these channel-dependent models on high-dimensional MTS data. Our analysis reveals that two primary issues lie in the introduced noise from unrelated series that increases the difficulty of capturing the crucial inter-channel dependencies, and challenges in training strategies due to high-dimensional data. To address these issues, we propose STHD, the Scalable Transformer for High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting. STHD has three components: a) Relation Matrix Sparsity that limits the noise introduced and alleviates the memory issue; b) ReIndex applied as a training strategy to enable a more flexible batch size setting and increase the diversity of training data; and c) Transformer that handles 2-D inputs and captures channel dependencies. These components jointly enable STHD to manage the high-dimensional MTS while maintaining computational feasibility. Furthermore, experimental results show STHD's considerable improvement on three high-dimensional datasets: Crime-Chicago, Wiki-People, and Traffic.

This multifaceted challenge has recently gained attention within the deep learning domain, facilitated by the availability of extensive, long-term earthquake datasets. Despite significant advancements, existing literature on earthquake nowcasting lacks comprehensive evaluations of pre-trained foundation models and modern deep learning architectures. These architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, uniquely focus on different aspects of data, including spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and multi-scale dependencies. This paper addresses the mentioned gap by analyzing different architectures and introducing two innovation approaches called MultiFoundationQuake and GNNCoder. We formulate earthquake nowcasting as a time series forecasting problem for the next 14 days within 0.1-degree spatial bins in Southern California, spanning from 1986 to 2024. Earthquake time series is forecasted as a function of logarithm energy released by quakes. Our comprehensive evaluation employs several key performance metrics, notably Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and Mean Squared Error, over time in each spatial region. The results demonstrate that our introduced models outperform other custom architectures by effectively capturing temporal-spatial relationships inherent in seismic data. The performance of existing foundation models varies significantly based on the pre-training datasets, emphasizing the need for careful dataset selection. However, we introduce a new general approach termed MultiFoundationPattern that combines a bespoke pattern with foundation model results handled as auxiliary streams. In the earthquake case, the resultant MultiFoundationQuake model achieves the best overall performance.">

        <tr id="In recent years, numerous Transformer-based models have been applied to long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. However, recent studies with linear models have questioned their effectiveness, demonstrating that simple linear layers can outperform sophisticated Transformer-based models. In this work, we review and categorize existing Transformer-based models into two main types: (1) modifications to the model structure and (2) modifications to the input data. The former offers scalability but falls short in capturing inter-sequential information, while the latter preprocesses time-series data but is challenging to use as a scalable module. We propose $\textbf{sTransformer}$, which introduces the Sequence and Temporal Convolutional Network (STCN) to fully capture both sequential and temporal information. Additionally, we introduce a Sequence-guided Mask Attention mechanism to capture global feature information. Our approach ensures the capture of inter-sequential information while maintaining module scalability. We compare our model with linear models and existing forecasting models on long-term time-series forecasting, achieving new state-of-the-art results. We also conducted experiments on other time-series tasks, achieving strong performance. These demonstrate that Transformer-based structures remain effective and our model can serve as a viable baseline for time-series tasks.">

This progress has inspired a series of innovative studies that explore the adaptation of PLMs to time series analysis, intending to create a unified foundation model that addresses various time series analytical tasks. However, these efforts predominantly focus on Regularly Sampled Time Series (RSTS), neglecting the unique challenges posed by Irregularly Sampled Time Series (ISTS), which are characterized by non-uniform sampling intervals and prevalent missing data. To bridge this gap, this work explores the potential of PLMs for ISTS analysis. We begin by investigating the effect of various methods for representing ISTS, aiming to maximize the efficacy of PLMs in this under-explored area. Furthermore, we present a unified PLM-based framework, ISTS-PLM, which integrates time-aware and variable-aware PLMs tailored for comprehensive intra and inter-time series modeling and includes a learnable input embedding layer and a task-specific output layer to tackle diverse ISTS analytical tasks. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that the ISTS-PLM, utilizing a simple yet effective series-based representation for ISTS, consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various analytical tasks, such as classification, interpolation, and extrapolation, as well as few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios, spanning scientific domains like healthcare and biomechanics.">

Most existing methods rely on a predefined graph structure or construct a single learnable graph throughout training. However, it is challenging to use a predefined graph structure to capture dynamic ST changes effectively due to evolving node relationships over time. Furthermore, these methods typically utilize only the original data, neglecting external temporal factors. Therefore, we put forward a novel time-varying graph convolutional network model that integrates external factors for multifeature ST series prediction. Firstly, we construct a time-varying adjacency matrix using attention to capture dynamic spatial relationships among nodes. The graph structure adapts over time during training, validation, and testing phases. Then, we model temporal dependence by dilated causal convolution, leveraging gated activation unit and residual connection. Notably, the prediction accuracy is enhanced through the incorporation of embedding absolute time and the fusion of multifeature. This model has been applied to three real-world multifeature datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in all cases. Experiments show that the method has high accuracy and robustness when applied to multifeature and multivariate ST series problems.">

Recently, patch-based transformers have emerged as a promising approach, segmenting data into sub-level patches that serve as input tokens. However, existing methods mostly rely on predetermined patch lengths, necessitating expert knowledge and posing challenges in capturing diverse characteristics across various scales. Moreover, time series data exhibit diverse variations and fluctuations across different temporal scales, which traditional approaches struggle to model effectively. In this paper, we propose a dynamic tokenizer with a dynamic sparse learning algorithm to capture diverse receptive fields and sparse patterns of time series data. In order to build hierarchical receptive fields, we develop a multi-scale Transformer model, coupled with multi-scale sequence extraction, capable of capturing multi-resolution features. Additionally, we introduce a group-aware rotary position encoding technique to enhance intra- and inter-group position awareness among representations across different temporal scales.

However, existing models exhibit limitations in capturing intricate time positional information and effectively utilizing these embeddings. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel model called D2Vformer. Unlike typical prediction methods that rely on RNNs or Transformers, this approach can directly handle scenarios where the predicted sequence is not adjacent to the input sequence or where its length dynamically changes. In comparison to conventional methods, D2Vformer undoubtedly saves a significant amount of training resources. In D2Vformer, the Date2Vec module uses the timestamp information and feature sequences to generate time position embeddings. Afterward, D2Vformer introduces a new fusion block that utilizes an attention mechanism to explore the similarity in time positions between the embeddings of the input sequence and the predicted sequence, thereby generating predictions based on this similarity. Through extensive experiments on six datasets, we demonstrate that Date2Vec outperforms other time position embedding methods, and D2Vformer surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fixed-length and variable-length prediction tasks.">

Mamba provides a near-linear alternative but is reported less effective in time series longterm forecasting due to potential information loss.

The integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers in traffic flow forecasting has gained significant adoption for enhancing prediction accuracy. Yet, the complex spatial and temporal dependencies present in traffic data continue to pose substantial challenges: (1) Most GNN-based methods assume that the graph structure reflects the actual dependencies between nodes, overlooking the complex dependencies present in the real-world context. (2) Standard time-series models are unable to effectively model complex temporal dependencies, hindering prediction accuracy. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a novel Transformer-based Spatiotemporal Graph Diffusion Convolution Network (TSGDC) for Traffic Flow Forecasting, which leverages graph diffusion and transformer to capture the complexity and dynamics of spatial and temporal patterns, thereby enhancing prediction performance. The authors designed an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) that learns separately from the feature dimensions collected by traffic sensors and the temporal dimensions of traffic data, aiding in spatiotemporal modeling. Chebyshev Graph Diffusion Convolution (GDC) is used to capture the complex dependencies within the spatial distribution. Sequence decomposition blocks, as internal operations of transformers, are employed to gradually extract long-term stable trends from hidden complex variables. Additionally, by integrating multi-scale dependencies, including recent, daily, and weekly patterns, accurate traffic flow predictions are achieved. Experimental results on various public datasets show that TSGDC outperforms conventional traffic forecasting models, particularly in accuracy and robustness.">

        <tr id="Long-term traffic flow forecasting plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation as it allows traffic managers to adjust their decisions in advance. However, the problem is challenging due to spatio-temporal correlations and complex dynamic patterns in continuous-time stream data. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) are among the state-of-the-art methods for learning continuous-time traffic dynamics. However, the traditional NDE models face issues in long-term traffic forecasting due to failures in capturing delayed traffic patterns, dynamic edge (location-to-location correlation) patterns, and abrupt trend patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a new NDE architecture called Multi-View Neural Differential Equations. Our model captures current states, delayed states, and trends in different state variables (views) by learning latent multiple representations within Neural Differential Equations. Extensive experiments conducted on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior prediction accuracy for long-term forecasting and robustness with noisy or missing inputs.">

        <tr id="Evolving networks are complex data structures that emerge in a wide range of systems in science and engineering. Learning expressive representations for such networks that encode their structural connectivity and temporal evolution is essential for downstream data analytics and machine learning applications. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised method for learning representations of temporal networks and employ these representations in the dynamic link prediction task. While temporal networks are typically characterized as a sequence of interactions over the continuous time domain, our study focuses on their discrete-time versions. This enables us to balance the trade-off between computational complexity and precise modeling of the interactions. We propose a recurrent message-passing neural network architecture for modeling the information flow over time-respecting paths of temporal networks. The key feature of our method is the contrastive training objective of the model, which is a combination of three loss functions: link prediction, graph reconstruction, and contrastive predictive coding losses. The contrastive predictive coding objective is implemented using infoNCE losses at both local and global scales of the input graphs. We empirically show that the additional self-supervised losses enhance the training and improve the model's performance in the dynamic link prediction task. The proposed method is tested on Enron, COLAB, and Facebook datasets and exhibits superior results compared to existing models.">

However, the highly dynamic and intricate nature of traffic sensor signals presents difficulties for traffic prediction, with current models for traffic prediction inadequate in meeting the requirements of both long-term and short-term prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning framework called dynamic spatial-temporal correlation learning network (DSTLNet) that jointly leverages dynamical spatial and temporal features of traffic sensor signals to further improve the accuracy of long-and short-term traffic modeling and route planning. Specifically, we leverage the temporal convolutional network to capture long-term correlations. In addition, a spatial graph convolutional network is developed to dynamically model spatial features, and long-and short-term fusion layers are used to fuse the extracted long-and short-term temporal features, respectively. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that DSTLNet is competitive with the state-of-the-art, especially for long-term traffic prediction.">

One approach involves training LLM architectures on tokenized time series data using cross-entropy loss. Although this method has demonstrated promising results, cross-entropy loss is primarily designed for classification tasks and does not account for the distance between classes. To address this limitation, we propose using the Wasserstein loss for such architectures. To validate our approach, we fine-tuned a foundational time series model on $22$ zero-shot datasets, comparing the performance of cross-entropy loss with that of Wasserstein loss.

        <tr id="The scaling of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized their capabilities in various tasks, yet this growth must be matched with efficient computational strategies. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture stands out for its ability to scale model size without significantly increasing training costs. Despite their advantages, current MoE models often display parameter inefficiency. For instance, a pre-trained MoE-based LLM with 52 billion parameters might perform comparably to a standard model with 6.7 billion parameters. Being a crucial part of MoE, current routers in different layers independently assign tokens without leveraging historical routing information, potentially leading to suboptimal token-expert combinations and the parameter inefficiency problem. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the Layerwise Recurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts (RMoE). RMoE leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to establish dependencies between routing decisions across consecutive layers. Such layerwise recurrence can be efficiently parallelly computed for input tokens and introduces negotiable costs. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RMoE-based language models consistently outperform a spectrum of baseline models. Furthermore, RMoE integrates a novel computation stage orthogonal to existing methods, allowing seamless compatibility with other MoE architectures. Our analyses attribute RMoE's gains to its effective cross-layer information sharing, which also improves expert selection and diversity. Our code is at https://github.com/qiuzh20/RMoE">

        <tr id="Learning useful representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) is challenging, due to the concurrent need to span long node interaction histories and grasp nuanced temporal details. In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.">

We propose a novel multi-modal time-series LLM approach that learns generalizable information across various domains with powerful zero-shot performance. First, we train a lightweight time-series encoder on top of an LLM to directly extract time-series information.

To address this issue, we propose the Local-Global Representation Alignment framework (LogoRA), which employs a two-branch encoder, comprising a multi-scale convolutional branch and a patching transformer branch. The encoder enables the extraction of both local and global representations from time series. A fusion module is then introduced to integrate these representations, enhancing domain-invariant feature alignment from multi-scale perspectives. To achieve effective alignment, LogoRA employs strategies like invariant feature learning on the source domain, utilizing triplet loss for fine alignment and dynamic time warping-based feature alignment. Additionally, it reduces source-target domain gaps through adversarial training and per-class prototype alignment. Our evaluations on four time-series datasets demonstrate that LogoRA outperforms strong baselines by up to $12.52\%$, showcasing its superiority in time series UDA tasks.">

However, their complex architectures result in large parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their practical application and scalability to global-scale forecasting. This paper aims to explore the key factor for accurate weather forecasting and design more efficient solutions. Interestingly, our empirical findings reveal that absolute positional encoding is what really works in Transformer-based weather forecasting models, which can explicitly model the spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. We theoretically prove that its effectiveness stems from the integration of geographical coordinates and real-world time features, which are intrinsically related to the dynamics of weather. Based on this, we propose LightWeather, a lightweight and effective model for station-based global weather forecasting. We employ absolute positional encoding and a simple MLP in place of other components of Transformer. With under 30k parameters and less than one hour of training time, LightWeather achieves state-of-the-art performance on global weather datasets compared to other advanced DL methods.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting is a crucial task that predicts the future values of variables based on historical data. Time series forecasting techniques have been developing in parallel with the machine learning community, from early statistical learning methods to current deep learning methods. Although existing methods have made significant progress, they still suffer from two challenges. The mathematical theory of mainstream deep learning-based methods does not establish a clear relation between network sizes and fitting capabilities, and these methods often lack interpretability. To this end, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into time series forecasting research, which has better mathematical properties and interpretability. First, we propose the Reversible Mixture of KAN experts (RMoK) model, which is a KAN-based model for time series forecasting. RMoK uses a mixture-of-experts structure to assign variables to KAN experts. Then, we compare performance, integration, and speed between RMoK and various baselines on real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that RMoK achieves the best performance in most cases. And we find the relationship between temporal feature weights and data periodicity through visualization, which roughly explains RMoK's mechanism. Thus, we conclude that KAN and KAN-based models (RMoK) are effective in time series forecasting. Code is available at KAN4TSF: https://github.com/2448845600/KAN4TSF.">

In this paper, we propose TF-TGN, which uses Transformer decoder as the backbone model for TGNN to enjoy Transformer's codebase for efficient training. In particular, Transformer achieves tremendous success for language modeling, and thus the community developed high-performance kernels (e.g., flash-attention and memory-efficient attention) and efficient distributed training schemes (e.g., PyTorch FSDP, DeepSpeed, and Megatron-LM). We observe that TGNN resembles language modeling, i.e., the message aggregation operation between chronologically occurring nodes and their temporal neighbors in TGNNs can be structured as sequence modeling. Beside this similarity, we also incorporate a series of algorithm designs including suffix infilling, temporal graph attention with self-loop, and causal masking self-attention to make TF-TGN work. During training, existing systems are slow in transforming the graph topology and conducting graph sampling. As such, we propose methods to parallelize the CSR format conversion and graph sampling. We also adapt Transformer codebase to train TF-TGN efficiently with multiple GPUs. We experiment with 9 graphs and compare with 2 state-of-the-art TGNN training frameworks. The results show that TF-TGN can accelerate training by over 2.20 while providing comparable or even superior accuracy to existing SOTA TGNNs.

        <tr id="Traffic flow prediction has garnered increasing attention in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Therefore, accurate prediction models are essential for enabling traffic management authorities to guide vehicles more efficiently through the road network. Existing works have employed innovative methods to tackle the traffic prediction problem efficaciously, but the modeling of spatial-temporal correlations in traffic networks and flow data has shown limited effectiveness. Consequently, there is a significant discrepancy between the predicted outcomes and real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduces a novel deep learning model called the Spatial-Temporal Exponential Smoothing Hybrid Transformer Network (STESHTN) for addressing the traffic flow prediction problem. STESHTN effectively captures both temporal and spatial dependencies. In the temporal dimension, we employ temporal exponential smoothing attention and multi-head self-attention to exploit the temporal associations present in traffic time-series data. In the spatial dimension, we utilize multiple graphs to construct the traffic road network. Our model's superior performance is demonstrated through experiments conducted on four real-world datasets, PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, and PEMS08.">

        <tr id="Time-series forecasting is a challenging task that traditionally requires specialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, foundation models preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors, demonstrating a surprisingly strong ability to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the promises and pitfalls of foundation models in making zero-shot forecasts of chaotic systems.">
