        <tr id="Significance Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.">

        <tr id="Significance Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science. The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.">

        <tr id="Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.">

        <tr id="Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.">

        <tr id="Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.">

        <tr id="A key task in the field of modeling and analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems is the recovery of unknown governing equations from measurement data only. There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems (MANDy) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions. The efficiency of the introduced approach will be illustrated with the aid of several high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="First principles modeling of physical systems has led to significant technological advances across all branches of science. For nonlinear systems, however, small modeling errors can lead to significant deviations from the true, measured behavior. Even in mechanical systems, where the equations are assumed to be well-known, there are often model discrepancies corresponding to nonlinear friction, wind resistance, etc. Discovering models for these discrepancies remains an open challenge for many complex systems. In this work, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to discover a model for the discrepancy between a simplified model and measurement data. In particular, we assume that the model mismatch can be sparsely represented in a library of candidate model terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several examples including experimental data from a double pendulum on a cart. We further design and implement a feed-forward controller in simulations, showing improvement with a discrepancy model.">

However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further modification.">

        <tr id="Researchers propose sparse regression for identifying governing partial differential equations for spatiotemporal systems. We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.">

        <tr id="Sparse model identification enables the discovery of nonlinear dynamical systems purely from data; however, this approach is sensitive to noise, especially in the low-data limit. In this work, we leverage the statistical approach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to several synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate substantial improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected from 1900 to 1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be exploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.">

Sparse regression, in particular, has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: 1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning; 2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations; and 3) the methods apply to composite regularizers, essential for total variation (TV) as well as sparsity-promoting formulations using tight frames. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, and greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. Following standards of reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.">

        <tr id="The discovery of dynamical models from data represents a crucial step in advancing our understanding of physical systems. Library-based sparse regression has emerged as a powerful method for inferring governing equations directly from spatiotemporal data, but current model-agnostic implementations remain computationally expensive, limiting their applicability to data that lack substantial complexity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a scalable framework that enables efficient discovery of complex dynamical models across a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, by ``discovering'' the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) from synthetic data generated by high-resolution simulations of turbulent MHD flows with viscous and Ohmic dissipation. Using a library of candidate terms that is $\gtrsim 10$ times larger than those in previous studies, we accurately recover the full set of MHD equations, including the subtle dissipative terms that are critical to the dynamics of the system. Our results establish sparse regression as a practical tool for uncovering fundamental physical laws from complex, high-dimensional data without assumptions on the underlying symmetry or the form of any governing equation.">

        <tr id="Time-delayed differential equations (TDDEs) are widely used to model complex dynamic systems where future states depend on past states with a delay. However, inferring the underlying TDDEs from observed data remains a challenging problem due to the inherent nonlinearity, uncertainty, and noise in real-world systems. Conventional equation discovery methods often exhibit limitations when dealing with large time delays, relying on deterministic techniques or optimization-based approaches that may struggle with scalability and robustness. In this paper, we present BayTiDe - Bayesian Approach for Discovering Time-Delayed Differential Equations from Data, that is capable of identifying arbitrarily large values of time delay to an accuracy that is directly proportional to the resolution of the data input to it. BayTiDe leverages Bayesian inference combined with a sparsity-promoting discontinuous spike-and-slab prior to accurately identify time-delayed differential equations. The approach accommodates arbitrarily large time delays with accuracy proportional to the input data resolution, while efficiently narrowing the search space to achieve significant computational savings. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of BayTiDe through a range of numerical examples, validating its ability to recover delayed differential equations from noisy data.">

Recently, there has been an explosion of interest surrounding data-driven approaches to weather modeling, which in many cases show improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to traditional methods. However, many of the current data-driven approaches employ highly parameterized neural networks, often resulting in uninterpretable models and limited gains in scientific understanding. In this work, we address the interpretability problem by explicitly discovering partial differential equations governing various weather phenomena, identifying symbolic mathematical models with direct physical interpretations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in particular, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm can learn effective weather models from both simulated and assimilated data. Our approach adapts the standard WSINDy algorithm to work with high-dimensional fluid data of arbitrary spatial dimension.

Deep networks offer high-accuracy results but lack interpretability, prompting interest in models built from simple components. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method has become the go-to approach for building such modular and interpretable models. SINDy leverages sparse regression with L1 regularization to identify key terms from a library of candidate functions. However, SINDy's choice of candidate library and optimization method requires significant technical expertise, limiting its widespread applicability. This work introduces Al-Khwarizmi, a novel agentic framework for physical law discovery from data, which integrates foundational models with SINDy. Leveraging LLMs, VLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our approach automates physical law discovery, incorporating prior knowledge and iteratively refining candidate solutions via reflection. Al-Khwarizmi operates in two steps: it summarizes system observations-comprising textual descriptions, raw data, and plots-followed by a secondary step that generates candidate feature libraries and optimizer configurations to identify hidden physics laws correctly. Evaluating our algorithm on over 198 models, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to alternatives, reaching a 20 percent increase against the best-performing alternative.">

The dynamics of the subdomain exhibiting slow singular value decay are learned with sFOM while the dynamics with intrinsically low dimensionality on the complementary subdomain are learned with OpInf. The resulting, coupled OpInf-sFOM formulation leverages the computational efficiency of OpInf and the high resolution of sFOM, and thus enables fast non-intrusive predictions for conditions beyond those sampled in the training data set. A novel regularization technique with a closed-form solution based on the Gershgorin disk theorem is introduced to promote stable sFOM and OpInf models. We also provide a data-driven indicator for the subdomain selection and ensure solution smoothness over the interface via a post-processing interpolation step. We evaluate the efficiency of the approach in terms of offline and online speedup through a quantitative, parametric computational cost analysis. We demonstrate the coupled OpInf-sFOM formulation for two test cases: a one-dimensional Burgers' model for which accurate predictions beyond the span of the training snapshots are presented, and a two-dimensional parametric model for the Pine Island Glacier ice thickness dynamics, for which the OpInf-sFOM model achieves an average prediction error on the order of $1 \%$ with an online speedup factor of approximately $8\times$ compared to the numerical simulation.">

However, purely data-driven approaches often struggle with extrapolation and may yield physically implausible forecasts. Furthermore, the learned dynamics can exhibit instabilities, making it difficult to apply such models safely and robustly. This article proposes stable port-Hamiltonian neural networks, a machine learning architecture that incorporates the physical biases of energy conservation or dissipation while guaranteeing global Lyapunov stability of the learned dynamics. Evaluations with illustrative examples and real-world measurement data demonstrate the model's ability to generalize from sparse data, outperforming purely data-driven approaches and avoiding instability issues.

        <tr id="System identification, the process of deriving mathematical models of dynamical systems from observed input-output data, has undergone a paradigm shift with the advent of learning-based methods. Addressing the intricate challenges of data-driven discovery in nonlinear dynamical systems, these methods have garnered significant attention. Among them, Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) has emerged as a transformative approach, distilling complex dynamical behaviors into interpretable linear combinations of basis functions. However, SINDy relies on domain-specific expertise to construct its foundational"library"of basis functions, which limits its adaptability and universality. In this work, we introduce a nonlinear system identification framework called LeARN that transcends the need for prior domain knowledge by learning the library of basis functions directly from data. To enhance adaptability to evolving system dynamics under varying noise conditions, we employ a novel meta-learning-based system identification approach that uses a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) to dynamically refine these basis functions. This not only captures intricate system behaviors but also adapts seamlessly to new dynamical regimes. We validate our framework on the Neural Fly dataset, showcasing its robust adaptation and generalization capabilities. Despite its simplicity, our LeARN achieves competitive dynamical error performance compared to SINDy. This work presents a step toward the autonomous discovery of dynamical systems, paving the way for a future where machine learning uncovers the governing principles of complex systems without requiring extensive domain-specific interventions.">

Besides deriving differential equations for dynamical systems based on basic scientific reasoning or prior knowledge in recent times a growing interest emerged to infer these equations purely from data. In this article, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key challenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this problem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least squares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the deviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the integrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we integrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated models and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the different error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization parameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's precision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach through applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a wake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a sparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation periods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI example, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent neural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring differential equations that capture potentially causal relationships.">

However, recently developed techniques to learn interpretable dynamical models from data are susceptible to inherent experimental noise, especially in reaction kinetics data. Here, we address these issues by (1) employing a new derivative-free technique for sparse identification of dynamical equations that approximates the integral rather than the derivative (which we call as DF-SINDy) and (2) including domain information such as mass balance and chemistry information. We demonstrate this using retrospective examples to recover the true (known) governing equations from synthetic data under varying noise levels, sampling frequencies, and number of experiments. We observe that (1) models discovered from DF-SINDy have lower errors than those discovered from SINDy (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We introduce ResKoopNet (Residual-based Koopman-learning Network), a novel method that addresses this limitation by explicitly minimizing the spectral residual to compute Koopman eigenpairs, which can identify a more precise and complete spectrum of the Koopman operator. This approach provides theoretical guarantees while maintaining computational adaptability through a neural network implementation. Experiments on physical and biological systems demonstrate ResKoopNet's superior accuracy in spectral approximation compared to existing methods, particularly for systems with continuous spectra and high dimensional, which makes it as an effective tool for analyzing complex dynamical systems.">

The kinetic formulation provides an excellent structure for ML algorithms by separating nonlinear, non-local physics into a nonlinear but local relaxation to equilibrium and a linear non-local transport. This separation allows the ML to focus on the local nonlinear components while addressing the simpler linear transport with efficient classical numerical algorithms. To accomplish this, we design an operator network that maps macroscopic observables to equilibrium states in a manner that maximizes entropy, yielding expressive BGK-type collisions. By incorporating our surrogate equilibrium into the lattice Boltzmann (LB) algorithm, we achieve accurate flow forecasts for a wide range of challenging flows. We show that NeurDE enables accurate prediction of compressible flows, including supersonic flows, while tracking shocks over hundreds of time steps, using a small velocity lattice-a heretofore unattainable feat without expensive numerical root finding.">

        <tr id="Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a pivotal role in scientific machine learning, especially when surrogate models are used to approximate complex systems. Although multilayer perceptions (MLPs) are commonly employed as surrogates, they often suffer from overfitting due to their large number of parameters. Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer an alternative solution with fewer parameters. However, gradient-based inference methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), may result in computational inefficiency when applied to KANs, especially for large-scale datasets, due to the high cost of back-propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, combining the dropout Tikhonov ensemble Kalman inversion (DTEKI) with Chebyshev KANs. This gradient-free method effectively mitigates overfitting and enhances numerical stability. Additionally, we incorporate the active subspace method to reduce the parameter-space dimensionality, allowing us to improve the accuracy of predictions and obtain more reliable uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various test cases, including scenarios with large datasets and high noise levels. Our results show that the new method achieves comparable or better accuracy, much higher efficiency as well as stability compared to HMC, in addition to scalability. Moreover, by leveraging the low-dimensional parameter subspace, our method preserves prediction accuracy while substantially reducing further the computational cost.">

Such an approach enables better predictions. However, the data-driven enrichment is usually represented by a regression, whose main drawbacks are (i) the difficulty of understanding the subjacent physics and (ii) the risks induced by the data-driven model extrapolation. This paper proposes a procedure enabling the extraction of a differential operator associated with the enrichment provided by the data-driven regression. For that purpose, a sparse Singular Value Decomposition, SVD, is introduced. It is then employed, first, in a full operator representation regularized optimization problem, where sparsity is promoted, leading to a linear programming problem, and then in a tensor decomposition of the operator’s identification procedure. The results show the ability of the method to identify the exact missing operators from the model. The regularized optimization problem was also able to identify the weights of the missing terms with a relative error of about 10% on average, depending on the selected use case.">

This tensor type of data is reminiscent of shuffled (multidimensional) puzzle tiles. The independent variables for the evolution equations (their “space” and “time”) as well as their effective parameters are all emergent, i.e. determined in a data-driven way from our disorganized observations of behavior in them. We use a diffusion map based questionnaire approach to build a smooth parametrization of our emergent space/time/parameter space for the data. This approach iteratively processes the data by successively observing them on the “space,” the “time” and the “parameter” axes of a tensor. Once the data become organized, we use machine learning (here, neural networks) to approximate the operators governing the evolution equations in this emergent space. Our illustrative examples are based (i) on a simple advection–diffusion model; (ii) on a previously developed vertex-plus-signaling model of Drosophila embryonic development; and (iii) on two complex dynamic network models (one neuronal and one coupled oscillator model) for which no obvious smooth embedding geometry is known a priori. This allows us to discuss features of the process like symmetry breaking, translational invariance, and autonomousness of the emergent PDE model, as well as its interpretability.">

Using optimal trajectories, we construct a bilinear control system in transformed state variables through a modified Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (EDMDc) that maintains exact dynamical equivalence with the original nonlinear system. We derive Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) optimality conditions for this system, which closely resemble those of the inverse Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem due to the consistent control input and state independence from the control. This similarity allows us to apply modified inverse LQR theory, offering a more tractable and robust alternative to nonlinear Inverse Optimal Control methods, especially when dealing with unknown dynamics.

        <tr id="Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) Systems are a well-established class of nonlinear systems with a rich theory for stability analysis, control, and analytical response finding, among other aspects. Although there are works on data-driven identification of such systems, the literature is quite scarce in terms of works that tackle the identification of LPV models for large-scale systems. Since large-scale systems are ubiquitous in practice, this work develops a methodology for the local and global identification of large-scale LPV systems based on nonintrusive reduced-order modeling. The developed method is coined as DMD-LPV for being inspired in the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). To validate the proposed identification method, we identify a system described by a discretized linear diffusion equation, with the diffusion gain defined by a polynomial over a parameter. The experiments show that the proposed method can easily identify a reduced-order LPV model of a given large-scale system without the need to perform identification in the full-order dimension, and with almost no performance decay over performing a reduction, given that the model structure is well-established.">

        <tr id="Continuous monitoring and real-time control of high-dimensional distributed systems are often crucial in applications to ensure a desired physical behavior, without degrading stability and system performances. Traditional feedback control design that relies on full-order models, such as high-dimensional state-space representations or partial differential equations, fails to meet these requirements due to the delay in the control computation, which requires multiple expensive simulations of the physical system. The computational bottleneck is even more severe when considering parametrized systems, as new strategies have to be determined for every new scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time closed-loop control strategy enhanced by nonlinear non-intrusive Deep Learning-based Reduced Order Models (DL-ROMs). Specifically, in the offline phase, (i) full-order state-control pairs are generated for different scenarios through the adjoint method, (ii) the essential features relevant for control design are extracted from the snapshots through a combination of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and deep autoencoders, and (iii) the low-dimensional policy bridging latent control and state spaces is approximated with a feedforward neural network. After data generation and neural networks training, the optimal control actions are retrieved in real-time for any observed state and scenario. In addition, the dynamics may be approximated through a cheap surrogate model in order to close the loop at the latent level, thus continuously controlling the system in real-time even when full-order state measurements are missing. The effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of computational speed, accuracy, and robustness against noisy data, is finally assessed on two different high-dimensional optimal transport problems, one of which also involving an underlying fluid flow.">

To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory to suppress superfluous parameters. PASTIS outperforms existing methods and reliably identifies minimal models, even with low sampling rates or measurement error.

        <tr id="Laplace Neural Operators (LNOs) have recently emerged as a promising approach in scientific machine learning due to the ability to learn nonlinear maps between functional spaces. However, this framework often requires substantial amounts of high-fidelity (HF) training data, which is often prohibitively expensive to acquire. To address this, we propose multi-fidelity Laplace Neural Operators (MF-LNOs), which combine a low-fidelity (LF) base model with parallel linear/nonlinear HF correctors and dynamic inter-fidelity weighting. This allows us to exploit correlations between LF and HF datasets and achieve accurate inference of quantities of interest even with sparse HF data. We further incorporate a modified replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm, which enables a more effective posterior distribution estimation and uncertainty quantification in model predictions. Extensive validation across four canonical dynamical systems (the Lorenz system, Duffing oscillator, Burgers equation, and Brusselator reaction-diffusion system) demonstrates the framework's effectiveness. The results show significant improvements, with testing losses reduced by 40% to 80% compared to traditional approaches. This validates MF-LNO as a versatile tool for surrogate modeling in parametric PDEs, offering significant improvements in data efficiency and uncertainty-aware prediction.">

In particular, it has shown incredible promise for handling several of the main challenges facing modern dynamics and control, including complexity, unmodeled dynamics, strong nonlinearity, and hidden variables. However, machine learning models are often expensive to train and deploy, fail to generalize beyond the training data, and suffer from a lack of explainability, interpretability, and guarantees, all of which limit their use in real-world and safety-critical control applications. Sparse nonlinear modeling and control techniques are a powerful class of machine learning that promote parsimony through sparse optimization, providing data-efficient models that are more interpretable and generalizable and have proven effective for control. In this review, we explore the use of sparse optimization in the context of machine learning to develop compact models and controllers that are easy to train, require significantly less data, and make low-latency predictions. In particular, we focus on applications in model predictive control and reinforcement learning, two of the foundational algorithms in control theory.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems is a crucial area of machine learning. In many scenarios, a thorough understanding of the model's behavior becomes essential for practical applications. For instance, understanding the behavior of a pharmacokinetic model, constructed as part of drug development, may allow us to both verify its biological plausibility (e.g., the drug concentration curve is non-negative and decays to zero) and to design dosing guidelines. Discovery of closed-form ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be employed to obtain such insights by finding a compact mathematical equation and then analyzing it (a two-step approach). However, its widespread use is currently hindered because the analysis process may be time-consuming, requiring substantial mathematical expertise, or even impossible if the equation is too complex. Moreover, if the found equation's behavior does not satisfy the requirements, editing it or influencing the discovery algorithms to rectify it is challenging as the link between the symbolic form of an ODE and its behavior can be elusive. This paper proposes a conceptual shift to modeling low-dimensional dynamical systems by departing from the traditional two-step modeling process. Instead of first discovering a closed-form equation and then analyzing it, our approach, direct semantic modeling, predicts the semantic representation of the dynamical system (i.e., description of its behavior) directly from data, bypassing the need for complex post-hoc analysis. This direct approach also allows the incorporation of intuitive inductive biases into the optimization algorithm and editing the model's behavior directly, ensuring that the model meets the desired specifications. Our approach not only simplifies the modeling pipeline but also enhances the transparency and flexibility of the resulting models compared to traditional closed-form ODEs.">

        <tr id="The successful application of modern machine learning for time series classification is often hampered by limitations in quality and quantity of available training data. To overcome these limitations, available domain expert knowledge in the form of parametrised mechanistic dynamical models can be used whenever it is available and time series observations may be represented as an element from a given class of parametrised dynamical models. This makes the learning process interpretable and allows the modeller to deal with sparsely and irregularly sampled data in a natural way. However, the internal processes of a dynamical model are often only partially observed. This can lead to ambiguity regarding which particular model realization best explains a given time series observation. This problem is well-known in the literature, and a dynamical model with this issue is referred to as structurally unidentifiable. Training a classifier that incorporates knowledge about a structurally unidentifiable dynamical model can negatively influence classification performance. To address this issue, we employ structural identifiability analysis to explicitly relate parameter configurations that are associated with identical system outputs. Using the derived relations in classifier training, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves the classifier's ability to generalize to unseen data on a number of example models from the biomedical domain. This effect is especially pronounced when the number of training instances is limited. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for structural identifiability, a topic that has received relatively little attention from the machine learning community.">

        <tr id="Predicting the dynamics of chaotic systems is crucial across various practical domains, including the control of infectious diseases and responses to extreme weather events. Such predictions provide quantitative insights into the future behaviors of these complex systems, thereby guiding the decision-making and planning within the respective fields. Recently, data-driven approaches, renowned for their capacity to learn from empirical data, have been widely used to predict chaotic system dynamics. However, these methods rely solely on historical observations while ignoring the underlying mechanisms that govern the systems' behaviors. Consequently, they may perform well in short-term predictions by effectively fitting the data, but their ability to make accurate long-term predictions is limited. A critical challenge in modeling chaotic systems lies in their sensitivity to initial conditions; even a slight variation can lead to significant divergence in actual and predicted trajectories over a finite number of time steps. In this paper, we propose a novel Physics-Guided Learning (PGL) method, aiming at extending the scope of accurate forecasting as much as possible. The proposed method aims to synergize observational data with the governing physical laws of chaotic systems to predict the systems' future dynamics. Specifically, our method consists of three key elements: a data-driven component (DDC) that captures dynamic patterns and mapping functions from historical data; a physics-guided component (PGC) that leverages the governing principles of the system to inform and constrain the learning process; and a nonlinear learning component (NLC) that effectively synthesizes the outputs of both the data-driven and physics-guided components. Empirical validation on six dynamical systems, each exhibiting unique chaotic behaviors, demonstrates that PGL achieves lower prediction errors than existing benchmark predictive models. The results highlight the efficacy of our design of data-physics integration in improving the precision of chaotic system dynamics forecasts.">

While deep learning has proven effective at modeling complex relationships from data, compositional couplings between system components typically introduce algebraic constraints on state variables, posing challenges to many existing data-driven approaches to modeling dynamical systems. Towards developing deep learning models for constrained dynamical systems, we introduce neural port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations (N-PHDAEs), which use neural networks to parametrize unknown terms in both the differential and algebraic components of a port-Hamiltonian DAE. To train these models, we propose an algorithm that uses automatic differentiation to perform index reduction, automatically transforming the neural DAE into an equivalent system of neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), for which established model inference and backpropagation methods exist. The proposed compositional modeling framework and learning algorithms may be applied broadly to learn control-oriented models of dynamical systems in a variety of application areas, however, in this work, we focus on their application to the modeling of electrical networks. Experiments simulating the dynamics of nonlinear circuits exemplify the benefits of our approach: the proposed N-PHDAE model achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy and constraint satisfaction when compared to a baseline N-ODE over long prediction time horizons. We also validate the compositional capabilities of our approach through experiments on a simulated D.C. microgrid: we train individual N-PHDAE models for separate grid components, before coupling them to accurately predict the behavior of larger-scale networks.">

However, traditional CFD methods are resource-intensive, particularly for high-fidelity simulations of complex flows, which are further complicated by high dimensionality, inherent stochasticity, and limited data availability. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a data-driven approach that leverages a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) to encode high-dimensional scientific data into low-dimensional, physically meaningful representations. The GMVAE learns a structured latent space where data can be categorized based on physical properties such as the Reynolds number while maintaining global physical consistency. To assess the interpretability of the learned representations, we introduce a novel metric based on graph spectral theory, quantifying the smoothness of physical quantities along the latent manifold. We validate our approach using 2D Navier-Stokes simulations of flow past a cylinder over a range of Reynolds numbers. Our results demonstrate that the GMVAE provides improved clustering, meaningful latent structure, and robust generative capabilities compared to baseline dimensionality reduction methods. This framework offers a promising direction for data-driven turbulence modeling and broader applications in computational fluid dynamics and engineering systems.">

        <tr id="Leveraging nonlinear parametrizations for model reduction can overcome the Kolmogorov barrier that affects transport-dominated problems. In this work, we build on the reduced dynamics given by Neural Galerkin schemes and propose to parametrize the corresponding reduced solutions on quadratic manifolds. We show that the solutions of the proposed quadratic-manifold Neural Galerkin reduced models are locally unique and minimize the residual norm over time, which promotes stability and accuracy. For linear problems, quadratic-manifold Neural Galerkin reduced models achieve online efficiency in the sense that the costs of predictions scale independently of the state dimension of the underlying full model. For nonlinear problems, we show that Neural Galerkin schemes allow using separate collocation points for evaluating the residual function from the full-model grid points, which can be seen as a form of hyper-reduction. Numerical experiments with advecting waves and densities of charged particles in an electric field show that quadratic-manifold Neural Galerkin reduced models lead to orders of magnitude speedups compared to full models.">

        <tr id="Filtering is concerned with online estimation of the state of a dynamical system from partial and noisy observations. In applications where the state is high dimensional, ensemble Kalman filters are often the method of choice. This paper establishes long-time accuracy of ensemble Kalman filters. We introduce conditions on the dynamics and the observations under which the estimation error remains small in the long-time horizon. Our theory covers a wide class of partially-observed chaotic dynamical systems, which includes the Navier-Stokes equations and Lorenz models. In addition, we prove long-time accuracy of ensemble Kalman filters with surrogate dynamics, thus validating the use of machine-learned forecast models in ensemble data assimilation.">

        <tr id="This paper considers the design of nonlinear data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) using kernel functions. Compared with existing methods that use kernels to parameterize multi-step predictors for nonlinear DeePC, we adopt a novel, operator-based approach. More specifically, we employ a universal product kernel parameterization of nonlinear systems operators as a prediction mechanism for nonlinear DeePC. We show that by using a product reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to learn the system trajectories, big data sets can be handled effectively to construct the corresponding product Gram matrix. Moreover, we show that the structure of the adopted product RKHS representation allows for a computationally efficient DeePC formulation. Compared to existing methods, our approach achieves substantially faster computation times for the same data size. This allows for the use of much larger data sets and enhanced control performance.">

        <tr id="This study investigates a novel application of Random Forest regression for analyzing the unstable set of the cusp catastrophe, a mathematical model
describing abrupt, nonlinear transitions in dynamical systems. The cusp catastrophe effectively captures critical phenomena such as bifurcation, hysteresis,
and multistability; however, modeling its unstable region remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and the localized nature of transitions in real world
data.
Random Forest’s ability to approximate complex, nonlinear relationships was evaluated across varying noise levels and data availabilities. The results
demonstrate that the model excels in low noise scenarios, accurately capturing the critical features of the unstable set. However, performance declines with
increasing noise and limited data, highlighting the need for noise tolerant strategies. This work provides new insights into leveraging machine learning for
robust modeling and prediction of unstable regions in non-linear dynamical systems, offering a foundation for future advancements in catastrophe theory
applications.">

        <tr id="A major challenge in neuroscience is reconciling idealized theoretical models with complex, heterogeneous experimental data. We address this challenge through the lens of continuous-attractor networks, which model how neural circuits may represent continuous variables, such as head direction or spatial location, through collective dynamics. In classical continuous-attractor models, a continuous symmetry of the connectivity generates a manifold of stable states, resulting in tuning curves that are identical up to shifts. However, mouse head-direction cells show substantial heterogeneity in their responses that appears incompatible with this classical picture. To understand the mechanistic origin of these data, we use an optimization principle to construct recurrent-network models that match the observed responses while exhibiting quasi-continuous-attractor dynamics. To study how such systems scale with increasing numbers of neurons N, we develop a statistical generative process that produces artificial tuning curves that match many features of the experimental data quantitatively. Due to a continuous symmetry in the generative process, the connectivity matrix exhibits doublet degeneracy in its spectrum at large N, reflecting an underlying circular geometry. Unlike classical models, where the ring structure is embedded in the neuronal space through a structured Fourier embedding, our model uses a random, disordered embedding. Analysis of the network dynamics in the large-N limit through dynamical mean-field theory reveals that the system becomes equivalent to a classical ring-attractor model. We extend this approach to higher-dimensional symmetries, applying it to grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and showing that the mean-field description recovers classical continuous-attractor models. Our work implies that large mammalian neural circuits could represent continuous variables using continuous-attractor dynamics, complete with continuous symmetry, in a way that is fully compatible with their heterogeneity and disorder.">

        <tr id="Uncovering the underlying dynamics from observed data is a critical task in various scientific fields. Recent advances have shown that combining deep learning techniques with linear multistep methods (LMMs) can be highly effective for this purpose. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) with LMMs for the discovery and approximation of dynamical systems' vector fields. Specifically, we begin by establishing precise error bounds for two-layer B-spline KANs when approximating the governing functions of dynamical systems. Leveraging the approximation capabilities of KANs, we demonstrate that for certain families of LMMs, the total error is constrained within a specific range that accounts for both the method's step size and the network's approximation accuracy. Additionally, we analyze the difference between the numerical solution obtained from solving the ordinary differential equations with the fitted vector fields and the true solution of the dynamical system. To validate our theoretical results, we provide several numerical examples that highlight the effectiveness of our approach.">

        <tr id="Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to describe the time evolution of natural phenomena across various scientific fields. Estimating the parameters of these systems from data is a challenging task, particularly when dealing with nonlinear and high-dimensional models. In this paper, we propose novel methodologies for parameter estimation in systems of ODEs by using the Newton-Raphson (NR) method and Gradient Descent (GD) method. By leveraging the discrete derivative and Taylor expansion, the problem is formulated in a way that enables the application of both methods, allowing for flexible, efficient solutions. Additionally, we extend these approaches to stochastic versions - Stochastic Newton-Raphson (SNR) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) - to handle large-scale systems with reduced computational cost. The proposed methods are evaluated by using numerical examples, including both linear and nonlinear parameter models, and compare the results to the well-known Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) method. While NR converges rapidly to the optimal solution, GD demonstrates robustness in handling chaotic systems, though it may occasionally lead to suboptimal results. Overall, the proposed methods provide improved accuracy in parameter estimation for ODE systems, outperforming NLS in terms of error metrics such as bias, mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination R2. These methods offer a valuable tool for fitting ODE models, particularly in scenarios involving big data and complex dynamics.">
