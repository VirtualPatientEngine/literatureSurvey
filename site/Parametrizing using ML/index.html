        <tr id="Many real-world systems such as social networks and moving planets are dynamic in nature, where a set of coupled objects are connected via the interaction graph and exhibit complex behavior along the time. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered as a dynamical system, where objects represent geographical locations (e.g., states) whose daily confirmed cases of infection evolve over time. Outbreak at one location may influence another location as people travel between these locations, forming a graph. Thus, how to model and predict the complex dynamics for these systems becomes a critical research problem. Existing work on modeling graph-structured data mostly assumes a static setting. How to handle dynamic graphs remains to be further explored. On one hand, features of objects change over time, influenced by the linked objects in the interaction graph. On the other hand, the graph itself can also evolve, where new interactions (links) may form and existing links may drop, which may in turn be affected by the dynamic features of objects. In this paper, we propose coupled graph ODE: a novel latent ordinary differential equation (ODE) generative model that learns the coupled dynamics of nodes and edges with a graph neural network (GNN) based ODE in a continuous manner. Our model consists of two coupled ODE functions for modeling the dynamics of edges and nodes based on their latent representations respectively. It employs a novel encoder parameterized by a GNN for inferring the initial states from historical data, which serves as the starting point of the predicted latent trajectories. Experiment results on the COVID-19 dataset and the simulated social network dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.">

        <tr id="We introduce a flexible, scalable Bayesian inference framework for nonlinear dynamical systems characterised by distinct and hierarchical variability at the individual, group, and population levels. Our model class is a generalisation of nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) dynamical systems, the statistical workhorse for many experimental sciences. We cast parameter inference as stochastic optimisation of an end-to-end differentiable, block-conditional variational autoencoder. We specify the dynamics of the data-generating process as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) such that both the ODE and its solver are fully differentiable. This model class is highly flexible: the ODE right-hand sides can be a mixture of user-prescribed or “white-box” sub-components and neural network or “black-box” sub-components. Using stochastic optimisation, our amortised inference algorithm could seamlessly scale up to massive data collection pipelines (common in labs with robotic automation). Finally, our framework supports interpretability with respect to the underlying dynamics, as well as predictive generalization to unseen combinations of group components (also called “zero-shot” learning). We empirically validate our method by predicting the dynamic behaviour of bacteria that were genetically engineered to function as biosensors.">

        <tr id="A patient's digital twin is a computational model that describes the evolution of their health over time. Digital twins have the potential to revolutionize medicine by enabling individual-level computer simulations of human health, which can be used to conduct more efficient clinical trials or to recommend personalized treatment options. Due to the overwhelming complexity of human biology, machine learning approaches that leverage large datasets of historical patients' longitudinal health records to generate patients' digital twins are more tractable than potential mechanistic models. In this manuscript, we describe a neural network architecture that can learn conditional generative models of clinical trajectories, which we call Digital Twin Generators (DTGs), that can create digital twins of individual patients. We show that the same neural network architecture can be trained to generate accurate digital twins for patients across 13 different indications simply by changing the training set and tuning hyperparameters. By introducing a general purpose architecture, we aim to unlock the ability to scale machine learning approaches to larger datasets and across more indications so that a digital twin could be created for any patient in the world.">

        <tr id="Pharmacometric models are pivotal across drug discovery and development, playing a decisive role in determining the progression of candidate molecules. However, the derivation of mathematical equations governing the system is a labor-intensive trial-and-error process, often constrained by tight timelines. In this study, we introduce PKINNs, a novel purely data-driven pharmacokinetic-informed neural network model. PKINNs efficiently discovers and models intrinsic multi-compartment-based pharmacometric structures, reliably forecasting their derivatives. The resulting models are both interpretable and explainable through Symbolic Regression methods. Our computational framework demonstrates the potential for closed-form model discovery in pharmacometric applications, addressing the labor-intensive nature of traditional model derivation. With the increasing availability of large datasets, this framework holds the potential to significantly enhance model-informed drug discovery.">

        <tr id="Multi-factor screenings are commonly used in diverse applications in medicine and bioengineering, including optimizing combination drug treatments and microbiome engineering. Despite the advances in high-throughput technologies, large-scale experiments typically remain prohibitively expensive. Here we introduce a machine learning platform, structure-augmented regression (SAR), that exploits the intrinsic structure of each biological system to learn a high-accuracy model with minimal data requirement. Under different environmental perturbations, each biological system exhibits a unique, structured phenotypic response. This structure can be learned based on limited data and once learned, can constrain subsequent quantitative predictions. We demonstrate that SAR requires significantly fewer data comparing to other existing machine-learning methods to achieve a high prediction accuracy, first on simulated data, then on experimental data of various systems and input dimensions. We then show how a learned structure can guide effective design of new experiments. Our approach has implications for predictive control of biological systems and an integration of machine learning prediction and experimental design.">

        <tr id="Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has demonstrated remarkable potential in drug dis-covery, where pharmacokinetics plays a crucial role in determining the dosage, safety, and efficacy of new drugs. A major challenge for AI-driven drug discovery (AIDD) is the scarcity of high-quality data, which often requires extensive wet-lab work. A typical example of this is pharmacokinetic experiments. In this work, we develop a physical formula enhanced mul-ti-task learning (PEMAL) method that predicts four key parameters of pharmacokinetics simultaneously. By incorporating physical formulas into the multi-task framework, PEMAL facilitates effective knowledge sharing and target alignment among the pharmacokinetic parameters, thereby enhancing the accuracy of prediction. Our experiments reveal that PEMAL significantly lowers the data demand, compared to typical Graph Neural Networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that PEMAL enhances the robustness to noise, an advantage that conventional Neural Networks do not possess. Another advantage of PEMAL is its high flexibility, which can be potentially applied to other multi-task machine learning scenarios. Overall, our work illustrates the benefits and potential of using PEMAL in AIDD and other scenarios with data scarcity and noise.">

        <tr id="Predicting cancer dynamics under treatment is challenging due to high inter-patient heterogeneity, lack of predictive biomarkers, and sparse and noisy longitudinal data. Mathematical models can summarize cancer dynamics by a few interpretable parameters per patient. Machine learning methods can then be trained to predict the model parameters from baseline covariates, but do not account for uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Instead, hierarchical Bayesian modeling can model the relationship between baseline covariates to longitudinal measurements via mechanistic parameters while accounting for uncertainty in every part of the model. The mapping from baseline covariates to model parameters can be modeled in several ways. A linear mapping simplifies inference but fails to capture nonlinear covariate effects and scale poorly for interaction modeling when the number of covariates is large. In contrast, Bayesian neural networks can potentially discover interactions between covariates automatically, but at a substantial cost in computational complexity. In this work, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of subpopulation dynamics that uses baseline covariate information to predict cancer dynamics under treatment, inspired by cancer dynamics in multiple myeloma (MM), where serum M protein is a well-known proxy of tumor burden. As a working example, we apply the model to a simulated dataset and compare its ability to predict M protein trajectories to a model with linear covariate effects. Our results show that the Bayesian neural network covariate effect model predicts cancer dynamics more accurately than a linear covariate effect model when covariate interactions are present. The framework can also be applied to other types of cancer or other time series prediction problems that can be described with a parametric model.">

        <tr id="Analyzing the drug response at the cellular level is crucial for identifying biomarkers and understanding the mechanisms of resistance. Although studies on the drug response of individual cells can provide novel insights into tumor heterogeneity, pharmacogenomic data related to single-cell (SC) RNA sequencing is often limited. Transfer learning provides a promising approach to translate the knowledge of drug response from bulk cell lines to SC analysis, potentially providing an effective solution to this challenge. Previous studies often use data from single drug-cell lines to pre-train specific models and adapt the models on SC datasets, which lack pharmacogenomic information from other drugs and hinder model generalization. In this work, we introduce MetaSCDrug as a unified meta pre-training framework that integrates molecular information with transcriptomic data to simultaneously modeling cellular heterogeneity in response to multiple pre-trained drugs and generalize to unseen drugs. Our model requires only one pre-training session, followed by fine-tuning on multiple single-cell datasets by few-shot learning, achieving an average of 4.58% accuracy increase in drug response prediction compared to the baselines. Furthermore, our meta pre-training strategy effectively captures transcriptome heterogeneity in the generalization of unseen drugs, achieving a 20% improvement over the model without meta pre-training. Case studies of our framework highlight its capability to identify critical genes for resistance, providing a method for exploring drug action pathways and understanding resistance mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) addresses the challenge of training predictive models under temporally varying data distributions. Traditional TDG approaches typically focus on domain data collected at fixed, discrete time intervals, which limits their capability to capture the inherent dynamics within continuous-evolving and irregularly-observed temporal domains. To overcome this, this work formalizes the concept of Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), where domain data are derived from continuous times and are collected at arbitrary times. CTDG tackles critical challenges including: 1) Characterizing the continuous dynamics of both data and models, 2) Learning complex high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and 3) Optimizing and controlling the generalization across continuous temporal domains. To address them, we propose a Koopman operator-driven continuous temporal domain generalization (Koodos) framework. We formulate the problem within a continuous dynamic system and leverage the Koopman theory to learn the underlying dynamics; the framework is further enhanced with a comprehensive optimization strategy equipped with analysis and control driven by prior knowledge of the dynamics patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.">

        <tr id="Abstract Motivation With the rapid advancement of single-cell sequencing technology, it becomes gradually possible to delve into the cellular responses to various external perturbations at the gene expression level. However, obtaining perturbed samples in certain scenarios may be considerably challenging, and the substantial costs associated with sequencing also curtail the feasibility of large-scale experimentation. A repertoire of methodologies has been employed for forecasting perturbative responses in single-cell gene expression. However, existing methods primarily focus on the average response of a specific cell type to perturbation, overlooking the single-cell specificity of perturbation responses and a more comprehensive prediction of the entire perturbation response distribution. Results Here, we present scPRAM, a method for predicting perturbation responses in single-cell gene expression based on attention mechanisms. Leveraging variational autoencoders and optimal transport, scPRAM aligns cell states before and after perturbation, followed by accurate prediction of gene expression responses to perturbations for unseen cell types through attention mechanisms. Experiments on multiple real perturbation datasets involving drug treatments and bacterial infections demonstrate that scPRAM attains heightened accuracy in perturbation prediction across cell types, species, and individuals, surpassing existing methodologies. Furthermore, scPRAM demonstrates outstanding capability in identifying differentially expressed genes under perturbation, capturing heterogeneity in perturbation responses across species, and maintaining stability in the presence of data noise and sample size variations.

Prediction of pharmacokinetic (PK) properties is crucial for drug discovery and development. Machine-learning (ML) models, which use statistical pattern recognition to learn correlations between input features (such as chemical structures) and target variables (such as PK parameters), are being increasingly used for this purpose. To embed ML models for PK prediction into workflows and to guide future development, a solid understanding of their applicability, advantages, limitations, and synergies with other approaches is necessary.


AREAS COVERED
This narrative review discusses the design and application of ML models to predict PK parameters of small molecules, especially in light of established approaches including in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. The authors illustrate scenarios in which the three approaches are used and emphasize how they enhance and complement each other. In particular, they highlight achievements, the state of the art and potentials of applying machine learning for PK prediction through a comphrehensive literature review.


EXPERT OPINION
ML models, when carefully crafted, regularly updated, and appropriately used, empower users to prioritize molecules with favorable PK properties. Informed practitioners can leverage these models to improve the efficiency of drug discovery and development process.">

        <tr id="Background The potential benefits of drug combination synergy in cancer medicine are significant, yet the risks must be carefully managed due to the possibility of increased toxicity. Although artificial intelligence applications have demonstrated notable success in predicting drug combination synergy, several key challenges persist: (1) Existing models often predict average synergy values across a restricted range of testing dosages, neglecting crucial dose amounts and the mechanisms of action of the drugs involved. (2) Many graph-based models rely on static protein-protein interactions, failing to adapt to dynamic and context-dependent networks. This limitation constrains the applicability of current methods. Results We introduced SAFER, a Sub-hypergraph Attention-based graph model, addressing these issues by incorporating complex relationships among biological knowledge networks and considering dosing effects on subject-specific networks. SAFER outperformed previous models on the benchmark and the independent test set. The analysis of subgraph attention weight for the lung cancer cell line highlighted JAK-STAT signaling pathway, PRDM12, ZNF781, and CDC5L that have been implicated in lung fibrosis. Conclusions SAFER presents an interpretable framework designed to identify drug-responsive signals. Tailored for comprehending dose effects on subject-specific molecular contexts, our model uniquely captures dose-level drug combination responses. This capability unlocks previously inaccessible avenues of investigation compared to earlier models. Finally, the SAFER framework can be leveraged by future inquiries to investigate molecular networks that uniquely characterize individual patients.">

        <tr id="Mammalian cells are commonly used as hosts in cell culture for biologics production in the pharmaceutical industry. Structured mechanistic models of metabolism have been used to capture complex cellular mechanisms that contribute to varying metabolic shifts in different cell lines. However, little research has focused on the impact of temporal changes in enzyme abundance and activity on the modeling of cell metabolism. In this work, we present a framework for constructing mechanistic models of metabolism that integrate growth-signaling control of enzyme activity and transcript dynamics. The proposed approach is applied to build models for three Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines using fed-batch culture data and time-series transcript profiles. Leveraging information from the transcriptome data, we develop a parameter estimation approach based on multi-cell-line (MCL) learning, which combines data sets from different cell lines and trains the individual cell-line models jointly to improve model accuracy. The computational results demonstrate the important role of growth signaling and transcript variability in metabolic models as well as the virtue of the MCL approach for constructing cell-line models with a limited amount of data. The resulting models exhibit a high level of accuracy in predicting distinct metabolic behaviors in the different cell lines; these models can potentially be used to accelerate the process and cell-line development for the biomanufacturing of new protein therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Drug synergy therapy is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, the extensive variety of available drugs and the time-intensive process of determining effective drug combinations through clinical trials pose significant challenges. It requires a reliable method for the rapid and precise selection of drug synergies. In response, various computational strategies have been developed for predicting drug synergies, yet the exploitation of heterogeneous biological network features remains underexplored. In this study, we construct a heterogeneous graph that encompasses diverse biological entities and interactions, utilizing rich data sets from sources, such as DrugCombDB, PubChem, UniProt, and cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE). We initialize node feature representations and introduce a novel virtual node to enhance drug representation. Our proposed method, the heterogeneous graph attention network for drug-drug synergy prediction (HANSynergy), has been experimentally validated to demonstrate that the heterogeneous graph attention network can extract key node features, efficiently harness the diversity of information, and further enhance network functionality through the incorporation of a multihead attention mechanism. In the comparative experiment, the highest accuracy (Acc) and area under the curve (AUC) are 0.877 and 0.947, respectively, in DrugCombDB_early data set, demonstrating the superiority of HANSynergy over the competing methods. Moreover, protein-protein interactions are important in understanding the mechanism of action of drugs. The heterogeneous attention mechanism facilitates protein-protein interaction analysis. By analyzing the changes of attention weight before and after heterogeneous network training, we investigated proteins that may be associated with drug combinations. Additionally, case studies align our findings with existing research, underscoring the potential of HANSynergy in drug synergy prediction. This advancement not only contributes to the burgeoning field of drug synergy prediction but also holds the potential to provide valuable insights and uncover new drug synergies for combating cancer.">

        <tr id="Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, more data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalizable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than the neural network alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularization, penalizing biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularization not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularization reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses. Author summary Systems biology concerns the modelling and analysis of biological processes, by viewing these as interconnected systems. Modelling is typically done either using mechanistic differential equations that are derived from experiments and known biology, or using machine learning on large biological datasets. While mathematical modelling from biological experiments can provide useful insights with limited data, building and validating these models takes a long time and often requires highly invasive measurements in humans. Efforts to combine this classical technique with machine learning have resulted in a framework termed universal differential equations, where the model equations contain a neural network to describe unknown biological interactions. While these methods have shown success in numerous fields, applications in biology are more challenging due to limited data-availability, high data sparsity. In this work, we have introduced physiology-informed regularization to overcome these instabilities and to constrain the model to biologically plausible behavior. Our results show that by using physiology-informed regularization, we can accurately predict future unseen observations in a simulated example, with much more limited data than a similar model without regularization. Additionally, we show an application of this technique on human data, applying a neural network to learn the appearance of glucose in the blood plasma after a meal.">

        <tr id="Representation learning for tumor gene expression (GEx) data with deep neural networks is limited by the large gene feature space and the scarcity of available clinical and preclinical data. The translation of the learned representation between these data sources is further hindered by inherent molecular differences. To address these challenges, we propose GExMix (Gene Expression Mixup), a data augmentation method, which extends the Mixup concept to generate training samples accounting for the imbalance in both data classes and data sources. We leverage the GExMix-augmented training set in encoder-decoder models to learn a GEx latent representation. Subsequently, we combine the learned representation with drug chemical features in a dual-objective enhanced gene-centric drug response prediction, i.e., reconstruction of GEx latent embeddings and drug response classification. This dual-objective design strategically prioritizes gene-centric information to enhance the final drug response prediction. We demonstrate that augmenting training samples improves the GEx representation, benefiting the gene-centric drug response prediction model. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of our proposed GExMix in enriching GEx data for deep neural networks. Moreover, our proposed gene-centricity further improves drug response prediction when translating preclinical to clinical datasets. This highlights the untapped potential of the proposed framework for GEx data analysis, paving the way toward precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Interventions play a pivotal role in the study of complex biological systems. In drug discovery, genetic interventions (such as CRISPR base editing) have become central to both identifying potential therapeutic targets and understanding a drug's mechanism of action. With the advancement of CRISPR and the proliferation of genome-scale analyses such as transcriptomics, a new challenge is to navigate the vast combinatorial space of concurrent genetic interventions. Addressing this, our work concentrates on estimating the effects of pairwise genetic combinations on the cellular transcriptome. We introduce two novel contributions: Salt, a biologically-inspired baseline that posits the mostly additive nature of combination effects, and Peper, a deep learning model that extends Salt's additive assumption to achieve unprecedented accuracy. Our comprehensive comparison against existing state-of-the-art methods, grounded in diverse metrics, and our out-of-distribution analysis highlight the limitations of current models in realistic settings. This analysis underscores the necessity for improved modelling techniques and data acquisition strategies, paving the way for more effective exploration of genetic intervention effects.">

Within dynamical systems, neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where the system equations are set to be governed by a neural network, have become a popular tool for this challenge in recent years. However, less emphasis has been placed on systems that are only partially-observed. In this work, we employ a hybrid neural ODE structure, where the system equations are governed by a combination of a neural network and domain-specific knowledge, together with symbolic regression (SR), to learn governing equations of partially-observed dynamical systems. We test this approach on two case studies: A 3-dimensional model of the Lotka-Volterra system and a 5-dimensional model of the Lorenz system. We demonstrate that the method is capable of successfully learning the true underlying governing equations of unobserved states within these systems, with robustness to measurement noise.">

        <tr id="Based on multi-omics data and drug information, predicting the response of cancer cell lines to drugs is a crucial area of research in modern oncology, as it can promote the development of personalized treatments. Despite the promising performance achieved by existing models, most of them overlook the variations among different omics and lack effective integration of multi-omics data. Moreover, the explicit modeling of cell line/drug attribute and cell line-drug association has not been thoroughly investigated in existing approaches. To address these issues, we propose RedCDR, a dual relation distillation model for cancer drug response (CDR) prediction. Specifically, a parallel dual-branch architecture is designed to enable both the independent learning and interactive fusion feasible for cell line/drug attribute and cell line-drug association information. To facilitate the adaptive interacting integration of multi-omics data, the proposed multi-omics encoder introduces the multiple similarity relations between cell lines and takes the importance of different omics data into account. To accomplish knowledge transfer from the two independent attribute and association branches to their fusion, a dual relation distillation mechanism consisting of representation distillation and prediction distillation is presented. Experiments conducted on the GDSC and CCLE datasets show that RedCDR outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in CDR prediction.

However, due to their complex structure, it is difficult to understand predictions made by these models which limits confidence. Current techniques to tackle this problem such as SHAP or integrated gradients provide insights by attributing importance to the input features of individual compounds. While these methods have produced promising results in some cases, they do not shed light on how representations of compounds are transformed in hidden layers, which constitute how neural networks learn. We present a novel technique to interpret neural networks which identifies chemical substructures in training data found to be responsible for the activation of hidden neurons. For individual test compounds, the importance of hidden neurons is determined, and the associated substructures are leveraged to explain the model prediction. Using structural alerts for mutagenicity from the Derek Nexus expert system as ground truth, we demonstrate the validity of the approach and show that model explanations are competitive with and complementary to explanations obtained from an established feature attribution method.">

Being one of the deadliest cancers that mandates longer medication and treatment phases, there is an inevitable need to have the knowledge of drug response of anti-pancreatic cancer drugs before it is recommended for a patient. AI-driven drug response prediction has proven potential to personalize treatment strategies, improve therapeutic outcomes, and reduce adverse effects and treatment costs for cancer patients. In this research work, we have accounted for the use of different drug descriptors and their core structures known as scaffolds along with three cell line features, chromatin profiling, reverse phase protein array, and metabolomics data to build a feature engineered dataset for drug response prediction tested on various computational learning models. The 53 unique drugs against 18 unique pancreatic cancer cell lines were taken as the raw dataset. The initial dataset having a large dimension was feature selected using an ensemble method derived from five different techniques. The dataset was evaluated on various computational methods and an accuracy of 89% was achieved using the TabNet architecture. Furthermore, the common scaffolds that were persistently found among the drugs that possess high IC50-valued drug clusters were also recorded.">

        <tr id="Combination therapy is a promising strategy for the successful treatment of cancer. The large number of possible combinations, however, mean that it is laborious and expensive to screen for synergistic drug combinations in vitro. Nevertheless, because of the availability of high-throughput screening data and advances in computational techniques, deep learning (DL) can be a useful tool for the prediction of synergistic drug combinations. In this study, we proposed a multimodal DL framework, MMSyn, for the prediction of synergistic drug combinations. First, features embedded in the drug molecules were extracted: structure, fingerprint, and string encoding. Then, gene expression data, DNA copy number, and pathway activity were used to describe cancer cell lines. Finally, these processed features were integrated using an attention mechanism and an interaction module and then input into a multilayer perceptron to predict drug synergy. Experimental results showed that our method outperformed five state-of-the-art DL methods and three traditional machine learning models for drug combination prediction. We verified that MMSyn achieved superior performance in stratified cross-validation settings using both the drug combination and cell line data. Moreover, we performed a set of ablation experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of each component and the efficacy of our model. In addition, our visual representation and case studies further confirmed the effectiveness of our model. All results showed that MMSyn can be used as a powerful tool for the prediction of synergistic drug combinations.">

This process predominantly involves the development of machine learning models that utilize a variety of data sources such as descriptions of the clinical trials, characteristics of the drug molecules, and specific disease conditions being targeted. Accurate predictions of trial outcomes are crucial for optimizing trial planning and prioritizing investments in a drug portfolio. While previous research has largely concentrated on small-molecule drugs, there is a growing need to focus on biologics-a rapidly expanding category of therapeutic agents that often lack the well-defined molecular properties associated with traditional drugs. Additionally, applying conventional methods like graph neural networks to biologics data proves challenging due to their complex nature. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language Interaction Network (LINT), a novel approach that predicts trial outcomes using only the free-text descriptions of the trials. We have rigorously tested the effectiveness of LINT across three phases of clinical trials, where it achieved ROC-AUC scores of 0.770, 0.740, and 0.748 for phases I, II, and III, respectively, specifically concerning trials involving biologic interventions.">

They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learn- ing models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irreg- ular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based mod- els, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experi- ments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.">

        <tr id="The mammalian genome organizes into complex three-dimensional structures, where interactions among chromatin regulatory elements play a pivotal role in mediating biological functions, highlighting the significance of genomic region interactions in biological research. Traditional biological sequencing techniques like HiC and MicroC, commonly employed to estimate these interactions, are resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially given the vast array of cell lines and tissues involved. With the advent of advanced machine learning (ML) methodologies, there has been a push towards developing ML models to predict genomic interactions. However, while these models excel in predicting interactions for cell lines similar to their training data, they often fail to generalize across distantly related cell lines or accurately predict interactions specific to certain cell lines. Identifying the potential oversight of excluding example genomic region interaction information from model inputs as a fundamental limitation, this paper introduces GRACHIP, a model rooted in graph neural network technology aiming to address this issue by incorporating detailed interaction information as a hint. Through extensive testing across various cell lines, GRACHIP not only demonstrates exceptional accuracy in predicting chromatin interaction intensity but showcases remarkable generalizability to cell lines not encountered during training. Consequently, GRACHIP emerges as a potent research tool, offering a viable alternative to conventional sequencing methods for analyzing the interactions and three-dimensional organization of mammalian genomes, thus alleviating the dependency on expensive and time-consuming biological sequencing techniques. It also offers an alternative way for researchers to investigate 3D chromatin interactions and simulate their changes in model systems to test their hypotheses.">

We present CoVar, an ML-based framework that builds upon the properties of existing inference models, to find the central genes driving perturbed gene expression across biological states. Unlike differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that capture changes in individual gene expression across conditions, CoVar focuses on identifying variational genes that undergo changes in their expression network interaction profiles, providing insights into changes in the regulatory dynamics, such as in disease pathogenesis. Subsequently, it finds core genes from among the nearest neighbors of these variational genes, which are central to the variational activity and influence the coordinated regulatory processes underlying the observed changes in gene expression. Through the analysis of simulated as well as yeast expression data perturbed by the deletion of the mitochondrial genome, we show that CoVar captures the intrinsic variationality and modularity in the expression data, identifying key driver genes not found through existing differential analysis methodologies.">

To advance research on personalized treatment strategies, the effectiveness of various drugs on cells derived from cancers (`cell lines') is experimentally determined in laboratory settings. Nevertheless, variations in the distribution of genomic data and drug responses between cell lines and humans arise due to biological and environmental differences. Moreover, while genomic profiles of many cancer patients are readily available, the scarcity of corresponding drug response data limits the ability to train machine learning models that can predict drug response in patients effectively. Recent cancer drug response prediction methods have largely followed the paradigm of unsupervised domain-invariant representation learning followed by a downstream drug response classification step. Introducing supervision in both stages is challenging due to heterogeneous patient response to drugs and limited drug response data. This paper addresses these challenges through a novel representation learning method in the first phase and weak supervision in the second. Experimental results on real patient data demonstrate the efficacy of our method (WISER) over state-of-the-art alternatives on predicting personalized drug response.">

However, a major challenge in drug response (DR) prediction is model interpretability as it aids in the validation of findings. This is important in biomedicine, where models need to be understandable in comparison with established knowledge of drug interactions with proteins. drGAT, a graph deep learning model, leverages a heterogeneous graph composed of relationships between proteins, cell lines, and drugs. drGAT is designed with two objectives: DR prediction as a binary sensitivity prediction and elucidation of drug mechanism from attention coefficients. drGAT has demonstrated superior performance over existing models, achieving 78% accuracy (and precision), and 76% F1 score for 269 DNA-damaging compounds of the NCI60 drug response dataset. To assess the model’s interpretability, we conducted a review of drug-gene co-occurrences in Pubmed abstracts in comparison to the top 5 genes with the highest attention coefficients for each drug. We also examined whether known relationships were retained in the model by inspecting the neighborhoods of topoisomerase-related drugs. For example, our model retained TOP1 as a highly weighted predictive feature for irinotecan and topotecan, in addition to other genes that could potentially be regulators of the drugs. Our method can be used to accurately predict sensitivity to drugs and may be useful in the identification of biomarkers relating to the treatment of cancer patients.">

        <tr id="The clinical trial process, also known as drug development, is an indispensable step toward the development of new treatments. The major objective of interventional clinical trials is to assess the safety and effectiveness of drug-based treatment in treating certain diseases in the human body. However, clinical trials are lengthy, labor-intensive, and costly. The duration of a clinical trial is a crucial factor that influences overall expenses. Therefore, effective management of the timeline of a clinical trial is essential for controlling the budget and maximizing the economic viability of the research. To address this issue, We propose TrialDura, a machine learning-based method that estimates the duration of clinical trials using multimodal data, including disease names, drug molecules, trial phases, and eligibility criteria. Then, we encode them into Bio-BERT embeddings specifically tuned for biomedical contexts to provide a deeper and more relevant semantic understanding of clinical trial data. Finally, the model's hierarchical attention mechanism connects all of the embeddings to capture their interactions and predict clinical trial duration. Our proposed model demonstrated superior performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.04 years and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.39 years compared to the other models, indicating more accurate clinical trial duration prediction.

With the advent of advanced microscopy, detailed images of complex tissue formations involving multiple cell types have become more accessible in recent years. However, deciphering the underlying rules that govern cell movements is far from trivial. Here, we present a novel deep learning framework to estimate the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the function of two-body interactions, thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.">

Alternatively, machine learning (ML) approaches may predict gene interactions if provided with enough data but they lack interpretability. Here, we propose an ML approach for interpretable genotype-fitness mapping, the Direct-Latent Interpretable Model (D-LIM). The neural network is built on a strong hypothesis: mutations in different genes cause independent effects in phenotypes, which then interact via non-linear relationships to determine fitness. D-LIM predicts genotype-fitness maps for combinations of mutations in multiple genes with state-of-the-art accuracy, showing the validity of the hypothesis in the case of a deep mutational scanning in a metabolic pathway. The hypothesisdriven structure of D-LIM offers interpretable features reminiscent of mechanistic models: the inference of phenotypes, fitness extrapolation outside of the data domain, and enhanced prediction in low-data regimes by the integration of prior knowledge.">

However, there has been limited research done on how best to combine or fuse the two types of features. Using a visible neural network with two deep learning branches for genes and drug features as the base architecture, we experimented with different fusion functions and fusion points. Our experiments show that injecting multiplicative relationships between gene and drug latent features into the original concatenation-based architecture DrugCell significantly improved the overall predictive performance and outperformed other baseline models. We also show that different fusion methods respond differently to different fusion points, indicating that the relationship between drug features and different hierarchical biological level of gene features is optimally captured using different methods. Considering both predictive performance and runtime speed, tensor product partial is the best-performing fusion function to combine late-stage representations of drug and gene features to predict cancer drug response.">

        <tr id="Motivation Mathematical modelling plays a crucial role in understanding of inter- and intracellular signalling processes. Currently, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are the predominant approach utilized in systems biology for modelling such pathways. While such mechanistic ODE models offer interpretability, they also suffer from limitations, including the need to consider all relevant compounds, resulting in large models that are difficult to handle numerically and require extensive data. Results In our previous work, we introduced the retarded transient function (RTF) as an alternative method for modelling the temporal response of signalling pathways. In this work, we extend the RTF approach to also integrate concentration or dose-dependencies of dynamics to fully cover the application range of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. This extension enables time- and dose-dependent predictions and offers an intuitive means to investigate and characterize signalling differences between biological conditions or cell types. To demonstrate the applicability of our extended RTF approach, we employ data from time- and dose-dependent inflammasome activation in primary murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our results show the effectiveness of the extended RTF approach as a generic framework for modelling dose-dependent kinetic data as they typically occur in cellular signalling. The presented approach offers intuitive interpretability of signal dynamics and enables predictive modelling of time- and dose-dependencies even if only individual cellular components are quantified.

        <tr id="The spread of infectious diseases is a highly complex spatiotemporal process, difficult to understand, predict, and effectively respond to. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have achieved impressive results in other learning and prediction tasks; however, while many AI solutions are developed for disease prediction, only a few of them are adopted by decision-makers to support policy interventions. Among several issues preventing their uptake, AI methods are known to amplify the bias in the data they are trained on. This is especially problematic for infectious disease models that typically leverage large, open, and inherently biased spatiotemporal data. These biases may propagate through the modeling pipeline to decision-making, resulting in inequitable policy interventions. Therefore, there is a need to gain an understanding of how the AI disease modeling pipeline can mitigate biased input data, in-processing models, and biased outputs. Specifically, our vision is to develop a large-scale micro-simulation of individuals from which human mobility, population, and disease ground truth data can be obtained. From this complete dataset – which may not reflect the real world – we can sample and inject different types of bias. By using the sampled data in which bias is known (as it is given as the simulation parameter), we can explore how existing solutions for fairness in AI can mitigate and correct these biases and investigate novel AI fairness solutions. Achieving this vision would result in improved trust in such models for informing fair and equitable policy interventions.">

        <tr id="Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) modeling attempts to describe the time course changes in tumor size for patients undergoing cancer therapy. TGI models present several advantages over traditional exposure-response models that are based explicitly on clinical end points and have become a popular tool in the pharmacometrics community. Unfortunately, the data required to fit TGI models, namely longitudinal tumor measurements, are sparse or often not available in literature or publicly accessible databases. On the contrary, common end points such as progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) are directly derived from longitudinal tumor measurements and are routinely published. To this end, a Bayesian generative model relating underlying tumor dynamics to summary PFS and ORR data is introduced to learn TGI model parameters using only published summary data. The parameterized model can describe the tumor dynamics, quantify treatment effect, and account for differences in the study population. The utility of this model is shown by applying it to several published studies, and learned parameters are combined to simulate an in silico trial of a novel combination therapy in a novel setting.">

The development of a mechanism-based model describing complex dynamics requires high expertise in pharmacometric (PMX) modeling and substantial model development time. A recently published machine learning (ML) approach of low-dimensional neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) is capable of modeling such data from newborns automatically. However, this efficient data-driven approach in itself does not result in a clinically interpretable model. In this work, an approach to deriving an interpretable model with reasonable PMX-type functions is presented. This "translation" was applied to derive a PMX model for serum creatinine in neonates considering maturation processes and covariates. The developed model was compared to a previously published mechanism-based PMX model whereas both models had similar mechanistic structures. The developed model was then utilized to simulate serum creatinine concentrations in the first few weeks of life considering different covariate values for gestational age and birth weight. The reference serum creatinine values derived from these simulations are consistent with observed serum creatinine values and previously published reference values. Thus, the presented NODE-based ML approach to model complex serum creatinine dynamics in newborns and derive interpretable, mathematical-statistical components similar to those in a conventional PMX model demonstrates a novel, viable approach to facilitate the modeling of complex dynamics in clinical settings and pediatric drug development.">

        <tr id="Background
Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are linear combinations of genetic markers weighted by effect size that are commonly used to predict disease risk. For complex heritable diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), PRS models fail to capture much of the heritability. Additionally, PRS models are highly dependent on the population structure of the data on which effect sizes are assessed and have poor generalizability to new data.


Objective
The goal of this study is to construct a paragenic risk score that, in addition to single genetic marker data used in PRS, incorporates epistatic interaction features and machine learning methods to predict risk for LOAD.


Methods
We construct a new state-of-the-art genetic model for risk of Alzheimer's disease. Our approach innovates over PRS models in two ways: First, by directly incorporating epistatic interactions between SNP loci using an evolutionary algorithm guided by shared pathway information; and second, by estimating risk via an ensemble of non-linear machine learning models rather than a single linear model. We compare the paragenic model to several PRS models from the literature trained on the same dataset.


Results
The paragenic model is significantly more accurate than the PRS models under 10-fold cross-validation, obtaining an AUC of 83% and near-clinically significant matched sensitivity/specificity of 75%. It remains significantly more accurate when evaluated on an independent holdout dataset and maintains accuracy within APOE genotype strata.


Conclusions
Paragenic models show potential for improving disease risk prediction for complex heritable diseases such as LOAD over PRS models.">

This paper delves into the development of a novel predictive model that leverages diverse data sources, including chemical structures, pharmacological properties, and scientific literature, to comprehensively analyse and foresee potential DDIs. The current state of DDIs is rife with limitations in scope and accuracy, making the development of an advanced system not only a necessity for enhancing patient safety but also a boon to pharmaceutical research and regulatory oversight. The relationship between two medications in which one drug’s pharmacological actions are altered by another is known as a drug-drug interaction (DDI). Favourable drug-drug interactions (DDIs) generally contribute to improved therapeutic results for patients. On the contrary, adverse DDIs pose a significant risk, often resulting in undesirable drug reactions that can potentially lead to the withdrawal of a drug from the market and even patient fatalities. Consequently, the identification of DDIs is essential for advancing new drug development and effectively managing diseases.

        <tr id="Abstract Computational drug sensitivity models have the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes by identifying targeted drugs components that are tailored to the transcriptomic profile of a given primary tumor. The SMILES representation of molecules that is used by state-of-the-art drug-sensitivity models is not conducive for neural networks to generalize to new drugs, in part because the distance between atoms does not generally correspond to the distance between their representation in the SMILES strings. Graph-attention networks, on the other hand, are high-capacity models that require large training-data volumes which are not available for drug-sensitivity estimation. We develop a modular drug-sensitivity graph-attentional neural network. The modular architecture allows us to separately pre-train the graph encoder and graph-attentional pooling layer on related tasks for which more data are available. We observe that this model outperforms reference models for the use cases of precision oncology and drug discovery; in particular, it is better able to predict the specific interaction between drug and cell line that is not explained by the general cytotoxicity of the drug and the overall survivability of the cell line.

        <tr id="Traditional cancer treatment methods have become less effective due to the increasing diversity of cancer types. To address this, precision medicine has gained support within the medical community. This approach tailors treatment to individual patients based on their specific disease characteristics. However, a major challenge lies in accurately predicting how a patient will respond to a specialized drug. Numerous machine learning-based predictive systems have been developed to address this challenge. These systems utilize genomic signatures and the chemical structure of drugs to predict drug activity. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based system for predicting the response of anticancer drugs. Our system utilizes hybrid features derived from both genetic expression and the chemical structure of drugs. It is developed using the well-known GDSC dataset (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer). Our system achieved a lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 0.889, in contrast to the RMSE value of 0.983 obtained by the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) system, SwNet. This indicates superior predictive accuracy. The findings suggest that our proposed research holds promise for the development of targeted drugs for anticancer treatments.">

Traditional compartmental modeling, while foundational, commonly struggles to fully capture the complexities of biological systems, including non-linear dynamics and variability. This study introduces an innovative data-driven neural network-based framework, inspired by Reaction Diffusion systems, designed to address these limitations. Our approach, which adaptively fits TACs from dPET, enables the direct calibration of diffusion coefficients and reaction terms from observed data, offering significant improvements in predictive accuracy and robustness over traditional methods, especially in complex biological scenarios. By more accurately modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of radiopharmaceuticals, our method advances modeling of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes, enabling new possibilities in quantitative nuclear medicine.">

        <tr id="Abstract Motivation Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) encode gene regulation in living organisms, and have become a critical tool to understand complex biological processes. However, due to the dynamic and complex nature of gene regulation, inferring GRNs from scRNA-seq data is still a challenging task. Existing computational methods usually focus on the close connections between genes, and ignore the global structure and distal regulatory relationships. Results In this study, we develop a supervised deep learning framework, IGEGRNS, to infer GRNs from scRNA-seq data based on graph embedding. In the framework, contextual information of genes is captured by GraphSAGE, which aggregates gene features and neighborhood structures to generate low-dimensional embedding for genes. Then, the k most influential nodes in the whole graph are filtered through Top-k pooling. Finally, potential regulatory relationships between genes are predicted by stacking CNNs. Compared with nine competing supervised and unsupervised methods, our method achieves better performance on six time-series scRNA-seq datasets. Availability and implementation Our method IGEGRNS is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/DHUDBlab/IGEGRNS.">

        <tr id="Diabetes is a worldwide health issue affecting millions of people. Machine learning methods have shown promising results in improving diabetes prediction, particularly through the analysis of diverse data types, namely gene expression data. While gene expression data can provide valuable insights, challenges arise from the fact that the sample sizes in expression datasets are usually limited, and the data from different datasets with different gene expressions cannot be easily combined. This work proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating multiple gene expression datasets and domain-specific knowledge using knowledge graphs, a unique tool for biomedical data integration. KG embedding methods are then employed to generate vector representations, serving as inputs for a classifier. Experiments demonstrated the efficacy of our approach, revealing improvements in diabetes prediction when integrating multiple gene expression datasets and domain-specific knowledge about protein functions and interactions.">

        <tr id="Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. In those applications, ML models are used to predict the properties of biological systems, and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates as new biological hypotheses for downstream experimental validations. However, when applied to unseen situations, these models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. One solution to address this issue is to quantify the model's prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) pre-specified by researchers. We propose CPEC, an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery. We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool known as conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme. Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. We expect CPEC to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited.">

Analyzing these data sets becomes especially daunting in the presence of rare events. Machine learning (ML) methods have gained traction for analyzing rare events, yet there has been limited exploration of bioinformatics tools that integrate ML techniques to comprehend the underlying biology. Expanding upon our previously developed computational framework of an integrative machine learning approach, we introduce PerSEveML, an interactive web-based tool that uses crowd-sourced intelligence to predict rare events and determine feature selection structures. PerSEveML provides a comprehensive overview of the integrative approach through evaluation metrics that help users understand the contribution of individual ML methods to the prediction process. Additionally, PerSEveML calculates entropy and rank scores, which visually organize input features into a persistent structure of selected, unselected, and fluctuating categories that help researchers uncover meaningful hypotheses regarding the underlying biology. We have evaluated PerSEveML on three diverse biologically complex data sets with extremely rare events from small to large scale and have demonstrated its ability to generate valid hypotheses.

Here, we develop BioDiscoveryAgent, an agent that designs new experiments, reasons about their outcomes, and efficiently navigates the hypothesis space to reach desired solutions. We demonstrate our agent on the problem of designing genetic perturbation experiments, where the aim is to find a small subset out of many possible genes that, when perturbed, result in a specific phenotype (e.g., cell growth). Utilizing its biological knowledge, BioDiscoveryAgent can uniquely design new experiments without the need to train a machine learning model or explicitly design an acquisition function. Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent achieves an average of 18% improvement in detecting desired phenotypes across five datasets, compared to existing Bayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our evaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of the language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts gene combinations to perturb twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task so far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent also has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing code to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically evaluate its predictions. Overall, BioDiscoveryAgent is interpretable at every stage, representing an accessible new paradigm in the computational design of biological experiments with the potential to augment scientists' capabilities.">

We also explore ongoing efforts to address these challenges, such as the development of standardized datasets, explainable AI techniques, and collaborations between academia, industry, and regulatory agencies.Overall, this paper highlights the potential of deep learning for early detection of ADRs in drug development and underscores the need for continued research and collaboration to realize the full benefits of these techniques in ensuring drug safety and improving public health.">

We believe the research community will be interested and can utilize our results here for the further development of biomarker-specific drug therapies in both GBM as well as other disease types. Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the deadliest, most heterogeneous, and most common brain cancer in adults. Not only is there an urgent need to identify efficacious therapeutics, but there is also a great need to pair these therapeutics with biomarkers that can help tailor treatment to the right patient populations. We built patient drug response models by integrating patient tumor transcriptome data with high-throughput cell line drug screening data as well as Bayesian networks to infer relationships between patient gene expression and drug response. Through these discovery pipelines, we identified agents of interest for GBM to be effective across five independent patient cohorts and in a mouse avatar model: among them are a number of MEK inhibitors (MEKis). We also predicted phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase enzyme (PHGDH) gene expression levels to be causally associated with MEKi efficacy, where knockdown of this gene increased tumor sensitivity to MEKi and overexpression led to MEKi resistance. Overall, our work demonstrated the power of integrating computational approaches. In doing so, we quickly nominated several drugs with varying known mechanisms of action that can efficaciously target GBM. By simultaneously identifying biomarkers with these drugs, we also provide tools to select the right patient populations for subsequent evaluation.">

        <tr id="Developing new pharmaceuticals is a costly and time-consuming endeavor fraught with significant safety risks. A critical aspect of drug research and disease therapy is discerning the existence of interactions between drugs and proteins. The evolution of deep learning (DL) in computer science has been remarkably aided in this regard in recent years. Yet, two challenges remain: (i) balancing the extraction of profound, local cohesive characteristics while warding off gradient disappearance and (ii) globally representing and understanding the interactions between the drug and target local attributes, which is vital for delivering molecular level insights indispensable to drug development. In response to these challenges, we propose a DL network structure, MolLoG, primarily comprising two modules: local feature encoders (LFE) and global interactive learning (GIL). Within the LFE module, graph convolution networks and leap blocks capture the local features of drug and protein molecules, respectively. The GIL module enables the efficient amalgamation of feature information, facilitating the global learning of feature structural semantics and procuring multihead attention weights for abstract features stemming from two modalities, providing biologically pertinent explanations for black-box results. Finally, predictive outcomes are achieved by decoding the unified representation via a multilayer perceptron. Our experimental analysis reveals that MolLoG outperforms several cutting-edge baselines across four data sets, delivering superior overall performance and providing satisfactory results when elucidating various facets of drug-target interaction predictions.">

        <tr id="Drug-Drug Interactions is a critical health and safety concern that receives a lot of attention from both academia and business. Polypharmacy is often employed as a strategy to manage complex diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and age-related ailments. However, combining medications with other drugs can lead to unintended adverse reactions. Interactions between drugs may increase the chance of unanticipated negative effects and even unknown toxicity, putting patients at risk. Detecting and identifying Interactions not only helps clinicians avoid chronic but will also encourage the co-prescription of safe drugs for more effective therapies. It is expensive and time-consuming to identify drug-drug interactions and Adverse Reactions among several medication pairings, both in vivo and in vitro. Recent advancements in computer science, specifically in the field of Artificial Intelligence, have yielded techniques that enable researchers to identify drug-drug interactions. We present comprehensive approaches that enable in-depth analysis of potential interactions by taking into account various factors, including molecular structure, clinical data, network relationships, and existing literature. This paper offers an all-encompassing survey of research studies that utilize Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms for the prediction of Drug-Drug interactions.">

        <tr id="e13603 Background: Oncology therapeutic development has high failure rates with substantial costs. Advances in technology, including molecular characterisations of cancer and computational power, provide the opportunity to better model therapeutic response for existing and emerging therapies. Methods: Concr adapted Bayesian statistical principles used by astrophysicists to effectively integrate multi-dimensional data (genomic & transcriptomic) for accurate modelling of cancer biology. Our proprietary computational framework was applied to predict clinical response and survival through construction of digital twins and in silico simulations of clinical trials. Predicted log odds ratios (LOR) were generated for drug response and compared to published data from 8 suitable historical clinical trials. Three distinct models underpin this framework: Drug Efficacy, Treatment Response & Overall Survival (OS). Three publicly available datasets were used for training: Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal ( in vitro dose-response data), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia and TCGA. Results: For all 8 clinical studies, the digital twin model accurately simulated both trial arms, compared drug efficacy across arms and predicted which treatment was most active. Unblinded evaluation: Our model accurately predicted gemcitabine would have greater clinical benefit than 5-FU (LOR -0.10, P <0.0001) in metastatic pancreatic cancer. In advanced breast cancer, the model predicted docetaxel had a higher response rate than doxorubicin, and carboplatin response rates were similar to docetaxel in BRCA wild-type patients. In platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, the model predicted cisplatin-based combination had a higher response rate than paclitaxel. Blinded evaluation: Using data for paclitaxel, the model correctly predicted that nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine response rates were higher than gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic cancer (predicted LOR -0.090, p = <0.001). In all 3 early breast cancer studies, predictions mirrored clinical trial results, adjuvant ECF > CMF, adjuvant TC > AC and adjuvant tamoxifen was superior to capecitabine. The underlying pan-tumour Overall Survival model used a Random Survival Forest approach, trained on 23 cancers with predictive accuracy of 0.78 AUC ROC and C-index 0.71. To enable cohort enrichment for drug response, the model segmented patient cohorts into treatment responder and non-responder. Using this approach, the log odds increased for drug response rate for 16 of the 19 different cancers and 14 of the different 17 drugs. Conclusions: Our digital twin model represents transformative technology for clinical trial simulation with strong potential for accelerating and de-risking clinical drug development, and utility for synthetic control arms.">

 A reliable means of hydrate plugging risk assessment in pipelines is critical to the modern practice of production in the hydrate management regime. Flow assurance engineers utilize computationally expensive multiphase flow simulations to characterize hydrate formation at desired conditions, however, there is no numerical method to assess the risk of a plug occurring from these results. Traditional machine learning models have shown reasonably accurate plugging risk classification and require just milliseconds to return an assessment. Despite this, there has been limited industry use due to concerns about the statistical nature of predictions and the sparsity of available training data.
 Deep neural networks (DNNs) are a purely data-driven machine learning model that require large quantities of labeled data to make accurate statistical predictions in their trained domain. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a variation of DNNs in which training additionally considers embedded domain physics, in the form of partial differential equations, to increase accuracy, lessen reliance on training data, and ground predictions. This work presents a PINN that has been trained to predict hydrate plugging risk. Training was directed by the mean squared error of the model's prediction against flowloop data and, critically, the residual of the hydrate intrinsic kinetics equation. The trained model showed improved accuracy over reference DNNs. A PINN of novel architecture embedded with the hydrate intrinsic kinetics equation was built in TensorFlow. Flowloop data from pilot-scale flowloops was used for the training and evaluation of the presented PINN. Performance was compared to two DNNs for plugging risk assessment. DNN1 was an earlier model presented at OTC 2019. DNN2 features identical architecture to the subject PINN but absent of the embedded physics. DNN1 was employed as a baseline for plugging risk assessment performance, whereas DNN2 was used to isolate the contribution of the embedded domain knowledge on inference accuracy. The PINN showed a plugging risk assessment accuracy of 98.7%, which is a meaningful improvement over the 95.0% accuracy offered by DNN1. Moreover, case studies show improved confidence in plug prediction. The effect of the embedded physics on model accuracy is quantified by a reduction in mean squared error of 13.3% in inference of hydrate volume fraction when compared to DNN2. These findings indicate that the increased accuracy is the result of the embedding of the hydrate intrinsic kinetics equation as well as the novel network architecture. Two additional PINNs were presented, further establish the superior behavior of PINNs in learning the solution to PDEs and under data-sparse conditions. This work provides a new approach for machine learning in hydrates by demonstrating a technique to accurately train neural networks through a combination of empirical data and domain knowledge. This line of research could ultimately lead to more informed quantification of hydrate plugging risk.">

        <tr id="Temporal link prediction is one of the most important tasks for predicting time-varying links by capturing dynamics within complex networks. However, it suffers from difficulties such as vulnerability to adversarial attacks and inadaptation to distinct evolutionary patterns. In this article, we propose a robust temporal link prediction architecture via stable gated models with reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL) consisting of a state encoding network (SEN) and a self-adaptive policy network (SPN). The former is utilized to capture network dynamics, while the latter helps the former adapt to distinct evolutionary patterns across various time periods. Within the SEN, a novel stable gate is introduced to ensure multiple spatiotemporal dependency paths and defend against adversarial attacks. An SPN is proposed to select different SEN instances by approximating the optimal action function, thereby adapting to various evolutionary patterns to learn the robust temporal and structural features from dynamic complex networks. It is proven that SAGE-LR with integral Lipschitz graph convolution is stable to relative perturbations in dynamic complex networks. With the aid of extensive experiments on five real-world graph benchmarks, SAGE-LR is shown to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision and stability of temporal link prediction and ability to successfully defend against various attacks. We also implement the temporal link prediction in shipping transaction networks, which forecast effectively its potential transaction risks.">

In pursuit of this goal, large cancer cell line panels have successfully been studied to elucidate the relationship between cellular features and treatment response. Due to the high dimensionality of these datasets, machine learning (ML) is commonly used for their analysis. However, choosing a suitable algorithm and set of input features can be challenging. We performed a comprehensive benchmarking of ML methods and dimension reduction (DR) techniques for predicting drug response metrics. Using the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer cell line panel, we trained random forests, neural networks, boosting trees and elastic nets for 179 anti-cancer compounds with feature sets derived from nine DR approaches. We compare the results regarding statistical performance, runtime and interpretability. Additionally, we provide strategies for assessing model performance compared with a simple baseline model and measuring the trade-off between models of different complexity. Lastly, we show that complex ML models benefit from using an optimized DR strategy, and that standard models—even when using considerably fewer features—can still be superior in performance.">

This study combines Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) with the Cox model to enhance the model's performance in analyzing recurrent events with dynamic temporal information. Compared to classical models, the LSTM-Cox model significantly improves the accuracy of extracting clinical risk features and exhibits lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values, while maintaining good performance on simulated datasets. In an empirical analysis of bladder cancer recurrence data, the model successfully reduced the mean squared error during the training phase and achieved a Concordance index of up to 0.90 on the test set. Furthermore, the model effectively distinguished between high and low-risk patient groups, and the identified recurrence risk features such as the number of tumor recurrences and maximum size were consistent with other research and clinical trial results. This study not only provides a straightforward and efficient method for analyzing recurrent data and extracting features but also offers a convenient pathway for integrating deep learning techniques into clinical risk prediction systems.">

Due to the complex nature of nanopore measurements and the high cost of obtaining ground truth datasets, there is a need for nanopore simulators. Existing simulators rely on handcrafted rules and parameters and do not learn an internal representation that would allow for analysing underlying biological factors of interest. Instead, we propose VADA, a purely data-driven method for simulating nanopores based on an autoregressive latent variable model. We embed subsequences of DNA and introduce a conditional prior to address the challenge of a collapsing conditioning. We introduce an auxiliary regressor on the latent variable to encourage our model to learn an informative latent representation. We empirically demonstrate that our model achieves competitive simulation performance on experimental nanopore data. Moreover, we show we have learned an informative latent representation that is predictive of the DNA labels. We hypothesize that other biological factors of interest, beyond the DNA labels, can potentially be extracted from such a learned latent representation.">

        <tr id="Identifying latent interactions within complex systems is key to unlocking deeper insights into their operational dynamics, including how their elements affect each other and contribute to the overall system behavior. For instance, in neuroscience, discovering neuron-to-neuron interactions is essential for understanding brain function; in ecology, recognizing the interactions among populations is key for understanding complex ecosystems. Such systems, often modeled as dynamical systems, typically exhibit noisy high-dimensional and non-stationary temporal behavior that renders their identification challenging. Existing dynamical system identification methods often yield operators that accurately capture short-term behavior but fail to predict long-term trends, suggesting an incomplete capture of the underlying process. Methods that consider extended forecasts (e.g., recurrent neural networks) lack explicit representations of element-wise interactions and require substantial training data, thereby failing to capture interpretable network operators. Here we introduce Lookahead-driven Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability (LINOCS), a robust learning procedure for identifying hidden dynamical interactions in noisy time-series data. LINOCS integrates several multi-step predictions with adaptive weights during training to recover dynamical operators that can yield accurate long-term predictions. We demonstrate LINOCS' ability to recover the ground truth dynamical operators underlying synthetic time-series data for multiple dynamical systems models (including linear, piece-wise linear, time-changing linear systems' decomposition, and regularized linear time-varying systems) as well as its capability to produce meaningful operators with robust reconstructions through various real-world examples.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In recent years, analyzing complex biological networks to predict future links in such networks has attracted the attention of many medical and computer science researchers. The discovery of new drugs is one of the application cases for predicting future connections in biological networks. The operation of drug-target interactions prediction (DTIP) can be considered a fundamental step in identifying potential interactions between drug and target to identify new drugs.


OBJECTIVE
The previous studies reveal that predictions are made based on known interactions using computational methods to solve the cost problem and avoid blind study of all interactions. But, there seem to be challenges such as the lack of confirmed negative samples and the low accuracy in some computational methods. Thus, we have proposed an efficient and hybrid approach called MKPUL-BLM to manage some of the aforementioned challenges for predicting drug-target interactions.


METHODS
The MKPUL-BLM combins multi-kernel and positive unlabeled learning (PUL) approaches. Our method uses more information to increase accuracy, in addition to minimizing small similarities using network information. Also, potential negative samples are produced using a PUL approach because of lacking negative laboratory samples. Finally, labels are expanded via a semi-supervised.


RESULTS
Our method improved to 0.98 and 0.94 in the old interactions set for the ROCAUC and AUPR criteria, respectively. Also, this method enhanced ROCAUC and AUPR criteria by 0.89 and 0.77 for the new interactions set.


CONCLUSION
The MKPUL-BLM can be considered an efficient alternative to achieve more reliable predictions in the field of DTIP.">

        <tr id="Physiological and pathological processes are governed by a network of genes called gene regulatory networks (GRNs). By reconstructing GRNs, we can accurately model how cells behave in their natural state and predict how genetic changes will affect them. Transcriptomic data of single cells are now available for a wide range of cellular processes in multiple species. Thus, a method building predictive GRNs from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, without any additional prior knowledge, could have a great impact on our understanding of biological processes and the genes playing a key role in them. To this aim, we developed IGNITE (Inference of Gene Networks using Inverse kinetic Theory and Experiments), an unsupervised machine learning framework designed to infer directed, weighted, and signed GRNs directly from unperturbed single-cell RNA sequencing data. IGNITE uses the GRNs to generate gene expression data upon single and multiple genetic perturbations. IGNITE is based on the inverse problem for a kinetic Ising model, a model from statistical physics that has been successfully applied to biological networks. We tested IGNITE on murine pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) transitioning from the naïve to formative states. Using as input only scRNA-seq data of unperturbed PSCs, IGNITE simulated single and triple gene knockouts. Comparison with experimental data revealed high accuracy, up to 74%, outperforming currently available methods. In sum, IGNITE identifies predictive GRNs from scRNA-seq data without additional prior knowledge and faithfully simulates single and multiple gene perturbations. Applications of IGNITE range from studying cell differentiation to identifying genes specifically active under pathological conditions.">

        <tr id="Machine learning techniques are steadily becoming more important in modern biology, and are used to build predictive models, discover patterns, and investigate biological problems. However, models trained on one dataset are often not generalizable to other datasets from different cohorts or laboratories, due to differences in the statistical properties of these datasets. These could stem from technical differences, such as the measurement technique used, or from relevant biological differences between the populations studied. Domain adaptation, a type of transfer learning, can alleviate this problem by aligning the statistical distributions of features and samples among different datasets so that similar models can be applied across them. However, a majority of state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods are designed to work with large-scale data, mostly text and images, while biological datasets often suffer from small sample sizes, and possess complexities such as heterogeneity of the feature space. This Review aims to synthetically discuss domain adaptation methods in the context of small-scale and highly heterogeneous biological data. We describe the benefits and challenges of domain adaptation in biological research and critically discuss some of its objectives, strengths, and weaknesses through key representative methodologies. We argue for the incorporation of domain adaptation techniques to the computational biologist's toolkit, with further development of customized approaches.">

        <tr id="In the era of big data, the sheer volume and complexity of datasets pose significant challenges in machine learning, particularly in image processing tasks. This paper introduces an innovative Autoencoder-based Dataset Condensation Model backed by Koopman operator theory that effectively packs large datasets into compact, information-rich representations. Inspired by the predictive coding mechanisms of the human brain, our model leverages a novel approach to encode and reconstruct data, maintaining essential features and label distributions. The condensation process utilizes an autoencoder neural network architecture, coupled with Optimal Transport theory and Wasserstein distance, to minimize the distributional discrepancies between the original and synthesized datasets. We present a two-stage implementation strategy: first, condensing the large dataset into a smaller synthesized subset; second, evaluating the synthesized data by training a classifier and comparing its performance with a classifier trained on an equivalent subset of the original data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the classifiers trained on condensed data exhibit comparable performance to those trained on the original datasets, thus affirming the efficacy of our condensation model. This work not only contributes to the reduction of computational resources but also paves the way for efficient data handling in constrained environments, marking a significant step forward in data-efficient machine learning.">

        <tr id="Advances in deep learning and sparse sensing have emerged as powerful tools for monitoring human motion in natural environments. We develop a deep learning architecture, constructed from a shallow recurrent decoder network, that expands human motion data by mapping a limited (sparse) number of sensors to a comprehensive (dense) configuration, thereby inferring the motion of unmonitored body segments. Even with a single sensor, we reconstruct the comprehensive set of time series measurements, which are important for tracking and informing movement-related health and performance outcomes. Notably, this mapping leverages sensor time histories to inform the transformation from sparse to dense sensor configurations. We apply this mapping architecture to a variety of datasets, including controlled movement tasks, gait pattern exploration, and free-moving environments. Additionally, this mapping can be subject-specific (based on an individual’s unique data for deployment at home and in the community) or group-based (where data from a large group are used to learn a general movement model and predict outcomes for unknown subjects). By expanding our datasets to unmeasured or unavailable quantities, this work can impact clinical trials, robotic/device control, and human performance by improving the accuracy and availability of digital biomarker estimates.">

        <tr id="10061 Background: Genomics precision medicine, deployed via tumor panel sequencing, now assists in deploying targeted therapies to cancer patients. Numerous clinical trials have investigated the utility and benefit of genomics precision medicine in multiple cancer indications. Current large-scale studies report actionability rates from ~35% to ~60%, although clinical benefit rates have been shown to be closer to 10%. While this has positively impacted patients in need, the gap between actionability and benefit remains a clinical challenge attributed to multiple factors including the complex, multi-factorial relationship between molecular status and response to therapy. These differences go beyond simple disease states and may be reflective of multiple clinically relevant features including age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Methods: We implemented a functional precision medicine (FPM) program where patients with advanced pediatric cancers were prospectively profiled via high-throughput drug sensitivity testing (DST) of FDA-approved agents on patient-derived tumor cells as well as genomics testing. The objective was to investigate the clinical utility and benefit of FPM guidance in the treatment of pediatric cancer and elucidate the relationship between molecular status of patients’ diseases and treatment responses. We generated DST data (n = 21 patients) and genomic profiling data (n = 20 patients) on pediatric cancer patients in Miami, FL, as well as post-hoc whole exome and transcriptome sequencing data (n = 13 patients) and investigated three specific relationships. Results: We analyzed the relationship between racial/ethnic background and functional response to anti-cancer agents, determining potential differences in response to therapeutic classes. Next, we examined relationships between functional response and cancer type, identifying an unanticipated lack of clustering between disease indications in patients with advanced pediatric cancers. Finally, we applied an explainable machine learning (xML) framework to the functional genomic dataset to develop multi-omics biomarker hypotheses for the chemotherapy agent idarubicin, pinpointing a potential multi-cancer relationship between response to idarubicin and known disease mechanisms in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the sole indication where idarubicin is approved. We further present additional proof-of-concept studies generating biomarker hypotheses via xML, demonstrating a framework for development of multi-omics biomarkers. Conclusions: We are now expanding our pan-pediatric cancer functional genomics dataset through an NIMHD-funded expansion cohort (NCT05857969, n = 65 patients) to further investigate multi-omics relationships between functional and molecular characteristics and understand the role of race/ethnicity in the complex relationship.">

        <tr id="The complexity, scale, and uncertainty in regulatory networks (e.g., gene regulatory networks and microbial networks) regularly pose a huge uncertainty in their models. These uncertainties often cannot be entirely reduced using limited and costly data acquired from the normal condition of systems. Meanwhile, regulatory networks often suffer from the non-identifiability issue, which refers to scenarios where the true underlying network model cannot be clearly distinguished from other possible models. Perturbation or excitation is a well-known process in systems biology for acquiring targeted data to reveal the complex underlying mechanisms of regulatory networks and overcome the non-identifiability issue. We consider a general class of Boolean network models for capturing the activation and inactivation of components and their complex interactions. Assuming partial available knowledge about the interactions between components of the networks, this paper formulates the inference process through the maximum aposteriori (MAP) criterion. We develop a Bayesian lookahead policy that systematically perturbs regulatory networks to maximize the performance of MAP inference under the perturbed data. This is achieved by optimally formulating the perturbation process in a reinforcement learning context and deriving a scalable deep reinforcement learning perturbation policy to compute near-optimal Bayesian policy. The proposed method learns the perturbation policy through planning without the need for any real data. The high performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comprehensive numerical experiments using the well-known mammalian cell cycle and gut microbial community networks.">

        <tr id="Inferring potential drug indications plays a vital role in the drug discovery process. It can be time-consuming and costly to discover novel drug indications through biological experiments. Recently, graph learning-based methods have gained popularity for this task. These methods typically treat the prediction task as a binary classification problem, focusing on modeling associations between drugs and diseases within a graph. However, labeled data for drug indication prediction is often limited and expensive to acquire. Contrastive learning addresses this challenge by aligning similar drug-disease pairs and separating dissimilar pairs in the embedding space. Thus, we developed a model called DrIGCL for drug indication prediction, which utilizes graph convolutional networks and contrastive learning. DrIGCL incorporates drug structure, disease comorbidities, and known drug indications to extract representations of drugs and diseases. By combining contrastive and classification losses, DrIGCL predicts drug indications effectively. In multiple runs of hold-out validation experiments, DrIGCL consistently outperformed existing computational methods for drug indication prediction, particularly in terms of top-k. Furthermore, our ablation study has demonstrated a significant improvement in the predictive capabilities of our model when utilizing contrastive learning. Finally, we validated the practical usefulness of DrIGCL by examining the predicted novel indications of Aspirin. The prediction model's code is available at https://github.com/yuxunluo9/DrIGCL.">

        <tr id="Evaluating pharmacokinetic properties of small molecules is considered a key feature in most drug development and high-throughput screening processes. Generally, pharmacokinetics, which represent the fate of drugs in the human body, are described from four perspectives: absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion-all of which are closely related to a fifth perspective, toxicity (ADMET). Since obtaining ADMET data from in vitro, in vivo or pre-clinical stages is time consuming and expensive, many efforts have been made to predict ADMET properties via computational approaches. However, the majority of available methods are limited in their ability to provide pharmacokinetics and toxicity for diverse targets, ensure good overall accuracy, and offer ease of use, interpretability and extensibility for further optimizations. Here, we introduce Deep-PK, a deep learning-based pharmacokinetic and toxicity prediction, analysis and optimization platform. We applied graph neural networks and graph-based signatures as a graph-level feature to yield the best predictive performance across 73 endpoints, including 64 ADMET and 9 general properties. With these powerful models, Deep-PK supports molecular optimization and interpretation, aiding users in optimizing and understanding pharmacokinetics and toxicity for given input molecules.

Our motivation comes from the important areas of predicting mortality and phenotyping where using different modalities of data could significantly improve our ability to predict. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new method that uses two separate encoders, one for each type of data, allowing the model to understand complex patterns in both visual and time-based information. Apart from the technical challenges, our goal is to make the predictive model more robust in noisy conditions and perform better than current methods. We also deal with imbalanced datasets and use an uncertainty loss function, yielding improved results while simultaneously providing a principled means of modeling uncertainty. Additionally, we include attention mechanisms to fuse different modalities, allowing the model to focus on what's important for each task. We tested our approach using the comprehensive multimodal MIMIC dataset, combining MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets. Our experiments show that our method is effective in improving multimodal deep learning for clinical applications. The code will be made available online.">

        <tr id="We consider the problem of learning the dynamics in the topology of time-evolving point clouds, the prevalent spatiotemporal model for systems exhibiting collective behavior, such as swarms of insects and birds or particles in physics. In such systems, patterns emerge from (local) interactions among self-propelled entities. While several well-understood governing equations for motion and interaction exist, they are difficult to fit to data due to the often large number of entities and missing correspondences between the observation times, which may also not be equidistant. To evade such confounding factors, we investigate collective behavior from a \textit{topological perspective}, but instead of summarizing entire observation sequences (as in prior work), we propose learning a latent dynamical model from topological features \textit{per time point}. The latter is then used to formulate a downstream regression task to predict the parametrization of some a priori specified governing equation. We implement this idea based on a latent ODE learned from vectorized (static) persistence diagrams and show that this modeling choice is justified by a combination of recent stability results for persistent homology. Various (ablation) experiments not only demonstrate the relevance of each individual model component, but provide compelling empirical evidence that our proposed model -- \textit{neural persistence dynamics} -- substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art across a diverse set of parameter regression tasks.">

Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allow the capture of high- resolution snapshots of cell states as they transition along temporal trajectories. Using these high-throughput datasets, we can train computational models to generate in silico ‘synthetic’ cells that faithfully mimic the temporal trajectories. Here we present OneSC, a platform that can simulate synthetic cells across developmental trajectories using systems of stochastic differential equations govern by a core transcription factors (TFs) regulatory network. Different from the current network inference methods, OneSC prioritizes on generating Boolean network that produces faithful cell state transitions and steady cell states that mimic real biological systems. Applying OneSC to real data, we inferred a core TF network using a mouse myeloid progenitor scRNA-seq dataset and showed that the dynamical simulations of that network generate synthetic single-cell expression profiles that faithfully recapitulate the four myeloid differentiation trajectories going into differentiated cell states (erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, granulocytes and monocytes).

There are few, if any, computational methods for variants comparable to biological activity predictions. To address this gap, we developed a machine learning method that uses protein three-dimensional structures from AlphaFold to predict how a variant will influence changes to a gene's downstream biological pathways. We trained state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers to predict which protein regions will most likely impact transcriptional activities of two proto-oncogenes, nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2L2)-related factor 2 (NRF2) and c-Myc.

We need to utilize them to better stratify patients into risk groups, discover new biomarkers and targets, repurpose known and discover new drugs to personalize medical treatment. Existing methodologies are limited and a paradigm shift is needed to achieve quantitative and qualitative breakthroughs. In this perspective paper, we survey the literature and argue for the development of a comprehensive, general framework for embedding of multi-scale molecular network data that would enable their explainable exploitation in precision medicine in linear time. Network embedding methods map nodes to points in low-dimensional space, so that proximity in the learned space reflects the network's topology-function relationships. They have recently achieved unprecedented performance on hard problems of utilizing few omic data in various biomedical applications. However, research thus far has been limited to special variants of the problems and data, with the performance depending on the underlying topology-function network biology hypotheses, the biomedical applications and evaluation metrics. The availability of multi-omic data, modern graph embedding paradigms and compute power call for a creation and training of efficient, explainable and controllable models, having no potentially dangerous, unexpected behaviour, that make a qualitative breakthrough. We propose to develop a general, comprehensive embedding framework for multi-omic network data, from models to efficient and scalable software implementation, and to apply it to biomedical informatics. It will lead to a paradigm shift in computational and biomedical understanding of data and diseases that will open up ways to solving some of the major bottlenecks in precision medicine and other domains.">

This study examines how atom-level pretraining with quantum mechanics (QM) data can mitigate violations of assumptions regarding the distributional similarity between training and test data and therefore improve performance and generalization in downstream tasks. In the public dataset Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC), we show how pretraining on atom-level QM improves performance overall and makes the activation of the features distributes more Gaussian-like which results in a representation that is more robust to distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that hidden state molecular representations are analyzed to compare the effects of molecule-level and atom-level pretraining on QM data.">

        <tr id="Drug response prediction (DRP) is a crucial phase in drug discovery, and the most important metric for its evaluation is the IC50 score. DRP results are heavily dependent on the quality of the generated molecules. Existing molecule generation methods typically employ classifier-based guidance, enabling sampling within the IC50 classification range. However, these methods fail to ensure the sampling space range's effectiveness, generating numerous ineffective molecules. Through experimental and theoretical study, we hypothesize that conditional generation based on the target IC50 score can obtain a more effective sampling space. As a result, we introduce regressor-free guidance molecule generation to ensure sampling within a more effective space and support DRP. Regressor-free guidance combines a diffusion model's score estimation with a regression controller model's gradient based on number labels. To effectively map regression labels between drugs and cell lines, we design a common-sense numerical knowledge graph that constrains the order of text representations. Experimental results on the real-world dataset for the DRP task demonstrate our method's effectiveness in drug discovery. The code is available at:https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RMCD-DBD1.">

        <tr id="Artificial intelligence is expected to help identify excellent candidates in drug discovery. However, we face a lack of data, as it is time-consuming and expensive to acquire raw data perfectly for many compounds. Hence, we tried to develop a novel quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) method to predict a parameter more precisely from an incomplete data set via optimizing data handling by making use of predicted explanatory variables. As a case study we focused on the tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient (Kp), which is an important parameter for understanding drug distribution in tissues and building the physiologically based pharmacokinetic model and is a representative of small and sparse data sets. In this study, we predicted the Kp values of 119 compounds in nine tissues (adipose, brain, gut, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, and skin), although some of these were not available. To fill the missing values in Kp for each tissue, first we predicted those Kp values by the nonmissing data set using a random forest (RF) model with in vitro parameters (log P, fu, Drug Class, and fi) like a classical prediction by a QSAR model. Next, to predict the tissue-specific Kp values in a test data set, we constructed a second RF model with not only in vitro parameters but also the Kp values of other tissues (i.e., other than target tissues) predicted by the first RF model as explanatory variables. Furthermore, we tested all possible combinations of explanatory variables and selected the model with the highest predictability from the test data set as the final model. The evaluation of Kp prediction accuracy based on the root-mean-square error and R2 value revealed that the proposed models outperformed other machine learning methods such as the conventional RF and message-passing neural networks. Significant improvements were observed in the Kp values of adipose tissue, brain, kidney, liver, and skin. These improvements indicated that the Kp information on other tissues can be used to predict the same for a specific tissue. Additionally, we found a novel relationship between each tissue by evaluating all combinations of explanatory variables. In conclusion, we developed a novel RF model to predict Kp values. We hope that this method will be applied to various problems in the field of experimental biology which often contains missing values in the near future.">

This study aims to optimize predictive accuracy through advanced machine learning methodologies, facilitating timely and targeted healthcare interventions for at-risk individuals. By analyzing relevant clinical data, predictive models developed in this research offer promising avenues for early identification of CKD, enabling proactive disease management strategies. The integration of machine learning techniques in CKD prediction not only enhances predictive accuracy but also contributes to advancing personalized healthcare.

        <tr id=" The emergence of machine learning in the recent decade has excelled in determining new potential features and nonlinear relationships existing between the data derived from the DNA sequences of genetic diseases. Machine learning also enhances the process of handling data with maximum predicted variables compared to observations during the data mining process of prediction. In this context, our study presents a deep learning model for predicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) in DNA sequences, with a focus on features within genetic data associated with diseases. Transcription Factors (TFs) play a crucial role in modulating gene expression by binding to TFBS. The accurate prediction of TFBS is essential for understanding genome function and evolution. Thus, we develop an efficient deep learning model that considers TFBS prediction as a nucleotide-level binary classification task. In our proposed model, first we create an input matrix using the original DNA sequences. Next, we encode these DNA sequences using one-hot encoding, representing them as a sequence of numerical values. We then employ three convolutional layers, allowing our model to capture intricate patterns and motif features over a larger spatial range. To capture important features within the DNA sequence and to focus on them, we incorporate an attention layer. Finally, a dense layer, consisting of two fully connected layers and a dropout layer, calculates the probability of TF binding site occurrence based on the features learned by the proposed model. Our experimental results, using in-vivo datasets obtained from Chip-seq, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed deep learning model in TFBS prediction compared to other existing state-of-the-art methods. The improvement in accuracy is due to additional layers of CNN and then an attention layer in the model. Thus, this result in a better performance of our approach in predicting the transcription factor binding sites and enhancing our understanding of gene regulation and genome function.">

        <tr id="Large language models manifest the ability of few-shot adaptation to a sequence of provided examples. This behavior, known as in-context learning, allows for performing nontrivial machine learning tasks during inference only. In this work, we address the question: can we leverage in-context learning to predict out-of-distribution materials properties? However, this would not be possible for structure property prediction tasks unless an effective method is found to pass atomic-level geometric features to the transformer model. To address this problem, we employ a compound model in which GPT-2 acts on the output of geometry-aware graph neural networks to adapt in-context information. To demonstrate our model's capabilities, we partition the QM9 dataset into sequences of molecules that share a common substructure and use them for in-context learning. This approach significantly improves the performance of the model on out-of-distribution examples, surpassing the one of general graph neural network models.">

Additionally, we train Cox proportional hazard models for each disease to perform survival analysis. Although the integration of multi-omics data significantly improves risk prediction for 8 diseases, we find that the contribution of metabolomic data is marginal when compared to standard demographic, genetic, and biomarker features. Nonetheless, we see that metabolomics is a useful replacement for the standard biomarker panel when it is not readily available.">

        <tr id="Cardiomyopathies, often caused by mutations in genes encoding muscle proteins, are traditionally treated by phenotyping hearts and addressing symptoms post irreversible damage. With advancements in genotyping, early diagnosis is now possible, potentially preventing such damage. However, the intricate structure of muscle and its myriad proteins make treatment predictions challenging. Here we approach the problem of estimating therapeutic targets for a mutation in mouse muscle using a spatially explicit half sarcomere muscle model. We selected 9 rate parameters in our model linked to both small molecules and cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. We then randomly varied these rate parameters and simulated an isometric twitch for each combination to generate a large training dataset. We used this dataset to train a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), a technique used in Bayesian parameter estimation. Given simulated or experimental isometric twitches, this machine learning model is able to then predict the set of rate parameters which are most likely to yield that result. We then predict the set of rate parameters associated with both control and the cardiac Troponin C (cTnC) I61Q variant in mouse trabeculae and and model parameters that recover the abnormal 61Q cTnC twitches. Significance Statement Machine learning techniques have potential to accelerate discoveries in biologically complex systems. However, they require large data sets and can be challenging in high dimensional systems such as cardiac muscle. In this study, we combined experimental measures of cardiac muscle twitch forces with mechanistic simulations and a newly developed mixture of Bayesian inference with neural networks (in autoencoders) to solve the inverse problem of determining the underlying kinetics for observed force generation by cardiac muscle. The autoencoders are trained on millions of simulations spanning parameter spaces that correspond to the mechanochemistry of cardiac sarcomeres. We apply the trained model to experimental data in order to infer parameters that can explain a diseased twitch and ways to recover it.">

 The temporal resolution of environmental data sets plays a major role in the granularity of the information that can be derived from the data. In most cases, it is required that different data sets have a common temporal resolution to enable their consistent evaluations and applications in making informed decisions. This study leverages deep learning with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and model inference to enhance the temporal resolution of climate datasets, specifically temperature, and precipitation, from daily to sub-daily scales. We trained our model to learn the relationship between daily and sub-daily data, subsequently applying this knowledge to increase the resolution of a separate dataset with a coarser (daily) temporal resolution. Our findings reveal a high degree of accuracy for temperature predictions, evidenced by a correlation of 0.99 and a mean absolute error of 0.21 °C, between the actual and predicted sub-daily values. In contrast, the approach was less effective for precipitation, achieving an explained variance of only 37%, compared to 98% for temperature. Further, besides the sub-daily interpolation of the climate data sets, we adapted our approach to increase the resolution of the Normalized difference vegetation index of Landsat (from 16-day to 5-day interval) using the LSTM model pre-trained from the Sentinel 2 Normalized difference vegetation index - that exists at a relatively higher temporal resolution. The explained variance between the predicted Landsat and Sentinel 1 data is 70% with a mean absolute error of 0.03. These results suggest that our method is particularly suitable for environmental datasets with less pronounced short-term variability, offering a promising tool for improving the resolution and utility of the data.">

        <tr id="In many real-world applications where the system dynamics has an underlying interdependency among its variables (such as power grid, economics, neuroscience, omics networks, environmental ecosystems, and others), one is often interested in knowing whether the past values of one time series influences the future of another, known as Granger causality, and the associated underlying dynamics. This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go. NKDCD also utilizes sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights of the lag matrices, encouraging the model to select only the needed causal dependencies within the data. Through extensive testing on practically applicable datasets, it is shown that the NKDCD outperforms the existing nonlinear Granger causality discovery approaches.">

        <tr id="Measurement and analysis of cardio-respiratory function in animal models is essential for our understanding of functional and disease mechanisms that pave the way for human therapeutics and treatments. However, physiological phenotyping in conscious animals is often an onerous process requiring significant observer time, attention, and manual effort while being susceptible to bias and variability that ultimately limits the kinds of questions that can be asked and answered. Once data is collected, comprehensive and accurate analysis is challenging as it often requires either the use of expensive commercial software(s) with limited flexibility to meet the investigator’s needs or lab developed scripts that are often arduous and require specialized skills to utilize, resulting in incremental insights. Here we present an overview of our high throughput physiology assessment and analysis pipeline for interrogating disease mechanisms and enabling drug discovery in congenital cardio-respiratory disorders such as the lethal sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We first developed a closed loop robotic platform for automated neonate cardio-respiratory experiments (Looper) that enables automated interventional studies (i.e. hypoxic induction or drug application) based on real-time physiological feedback during the experiment. We show that deployment of multiple Looper platforms in parallel enables an order of magnitude increase in data collection for a single observer over a single workday and is highly scalable to achieve yet greater outputs. When combined with well designed genetically engineered or other disease mouse models, large scale genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanistic insights and drug discovery become feasible through physiological screening paradigms. Next, we developed an open-sourced cardio-respiratory assessment software tool (Breathe Easy) that enables facile deep interrogation of terabytes of data in a high throughput fashion while offering extensive customization capabilities to allow for unique case by case analysis by more skilled users. Breathe Easy output offers near publication ready graphical outputs with significance markings and statistical tables for rapid presentation of results through manuscripts and web-publishing. Lastly, we will present our early work leveraging our robotic and software pipeline to build an analytical machine learning framework that can predict cardio-respiratory failure (death) with high temporal specificity (more than 10 min out) in our SIDS like assay and our efforts to utilize the trained algorithms for 1) real-time prediction, feedback, and intervention application in our SIDS like assays on the Looper platform to screen small molecules for novel therapeutics; 2) elucidating unique physiological mechanisms through comparative training in distinct SIDS models; and 3) determining the potential for these machine learning approaches to be used in human polysomnographic recordings to identify at risk infants.

        <tr id="e13641 Background: Patient eligibility is a routine concept in clinical research, comprised of simple or complex set of inclusion or exclusion criteria applied in a specific sequence. Our methodology introduces the concept of ‘availability’ as a narrower term that is closer to the actual number that will be considered for a specific study and who may decide to participate. This specific research develops Machine Learning (ML) model that dynamically predicts likelihood of Multiple Myeloma progression and departure from targeted outcomes to sustain therapy and to indicate potential availability for clinical trials – to reduce screening efforts and improve screening precision of clinical research organizations. Methods: The cohort for training these models was drawn from the ConcertAI Oncology Research database, further enriched by key variables derived from unstructured data sources. Eligible patients for the analysis had a diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma made after Jan 1, 2020. Progressions were labelled using International Myeloma Working Group Criteria. Patients that did not satisfy the criteria were censored. Labels were assigned to patients after initial diagnosis of MM, and the duration between diagnosis to label was computed to build time to event (TTE) models. Over 2000 features were created to build this model, e.g., laboratory values, vitals, biomarkers, medications, ECOG, stage, etc. Variable creation preserved temporality of lab variables and vitals and noted presence of other variables. Several ML methods were employed to build the TTE models, with gradient boosting resulting in the highest c-index (0.8) based on 12 clinically relevant features. A temporal validation of the model was performed on a simulated index date. Results: Cohort used for training the model comprised of N = 4315 patients with average age at diagnosis of 72.3 years, and ~11% of the patients labelled as progressing. Temporal validation was performed on N = 1874 patients, with ~9% progression rate. The area under the curve (AUC) and weighted F1 score for this cohort was 87% and 89% respectively. Conclusions: Patient availability assessments are complex, not supported effectively by existing solutions and often require 100’s of hours from highly trained clinical personnel. An AI model predicting Multiple Myeloma progression built using a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrated 2-4x improvement in forecasting patient availability over other approaches. Integrating these solutions into clinical workflows can improve the effectiveness of research teams; enable more patients to have clinical trials as viable options at the right time; and allow care teams to have forward visibility to choices of standard-of-care and clinical trial alternatives in the best interest of patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Abstract How complex phenotypes emerge from intricate gene expression patterns is a fundamental question in biology. Quantitative characterization of this relationship, however, is challenging due to the vast combinatorial possibilities and dynamic interplay between genotype and phenotype landscapes. Integrating high-content genotyping approaches such as single-cell RNA sequencing and advanced learning methods such as language models offers an opportunity for dissecting this complex relationship. Here, we present a computational integrated genetics framework designed to analyze and interpret the high-dimensional landscape of genotypes and their associated phenotypes simultaneously. We applied this approach to develop a multimodal foundation model to explore the genotype-phenotype relationship manifold for human transcriptomics at the cellular level. Analyzing this joint manifold showed a refined resolution of cellular heterogeneity, enhanced precision in phenotype annotating, and uncovered potential cross-tissue biomarkers that are undetectable through conventional gene expression analysis alone. Moreover, our results revealed that the gene networks are characterized by scale-free patterns and show context-dependent gene-gene interactions, both of which result in significant variations in the topology of the gene network, particularly evident during aging. Finally, utilizing contextualized embeddings, we investigated gene polyfunctionality which illustrates the multifaceted roles that genes play in different biological processes, and demonstrated that for VWF gene in endothelial cells. Overall, this study advances our understanding of the dynamic interplay between gene expression and phenotypic manifestation and demonstrates the potential of integrated genetics in uncovering new dimensions of cellular function and complexity.">

Inspired by the variational framework of quantitative genetics, we create a population of individual networks possessing identical topology yet showcasing diversity in regulatory strengths.

        <tr id="The intricate nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge in predicting drug permeability, which is crucial for assessing central nervous system (CNS) drug efficacy and safety. This research utilizes an innovative approach, the classification read-across structure-activity relationship (c-RASAR) framework, that leverages machine learning (ML) to enhance the accuracy of BBB permeability predictions. The c-RASAR framework seamlessly integrates principles from both read-across and QSAR methodologies, underscoring the need to consider similarity-related aspects during the development of the c-RASAR model. It is crucial to note that the primary goal of this research is not to introduce yet another model for predicting BBB permeability but rather to showcase the refinement in predicting the BBB permeability of organic compounds through the introduction of a c-RASAR approach. This groundbreaking methodology aims to elevate the accuracy of assessing neuropharmacological implications and streamline the process of drug development. In this study, an ML-based c-RASAR linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model was developed using a dataset of 7807 compounds, encompassing both BBB-permeable and -nonpermeable substances sourced from the B3DB database (freely accessible from https://github.com/theochem/B3DB), for predicting BBB permeability in lead discovery for CNS drugs. The model's predictive capability was then validated using three external sets: one containing 276,518 natural products (NPs) from the LOTUS database (accessible from https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/download) for data gap filling, another comprising 13,002 drug-like/drug compounds from the DrugBank database (available from https://go.drugbank.com/), and a third set of 56 FDA-approved drugs to assess the model's reliability. Further diversifying the predictive arsenal, various other ML-based c-RASAR models were also developed for comparison purposes. The proposed c-RASAR framework emerged as a powerful tool for predicting BBB permeability. This research not only advances the understanding of molecular determinants influencing CNS drug permeability but also provides a versatile computational platform for the rapid assessment of diverse compounds, facilitating informed decision-making in drug development and design.">

        <tr id="Interpretable machine learning has emerged as central in leveraging artificial intelligence within high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where understanding the rationale behind model predictions is as critical as achieving high predictive accuracy. In this context, feature selection assumes a pivotal role in enhancing model interpretability by identifying the most important input features in black-box models. While random forests are frequently used in biomedicine for their remarkable performance on tabular datasets, the accuracy gained from aggregating decision trees comes at the expense of interpretability. Consequently, feature selection for enhancing interpretability in random forests has been extensively explored in supervised settings. However, its investigation in the unsupervised regime remains notably limited. To address this gap, the study introduces novel methods to construct feature graphs from unsupervised random forests and feature selection strategies to derive effective feature combinations from these graphs. Feature graphs are constructed for the entire dataset as well as individual clusters leveraging the parent-child node splits within the trees, such that feature centrality captures their relevance to the clustering task, while edge weights reflect the discriminating power of feature pairs. Graph-based feature selection methods are extensively evaluated on synthetic and benchmark datasets both in terms of their ability to reduce dimensionality while improving clustering performance, as well as to enhance model interpretability. An application on omics data for disease subtyping identifies the top features for each cluster, showcasing the potential of the proposed approach to enhance interpretability in clustering analyses and its utility in a real-world biomedical application.">

        <tr id="GPU kernels have come to the forefront of computing due to their utility in varied fields, from high-performance computing to machine learning. A typical GPU compute kernel is invoked millions, if not billions of times in a typical application, which makes their performance highly critical. Due to the unknown nature of the optimization surface, an exhaustive search is required to discover the global optimum, which is infeasible due to the possible exponential number of parameter combinations. In this work, we propose a methodology that uses deep sequence-to-sequence models to predict the optimal tuning parameters governing compute kernels. This work considers the prediction of kernel parameters as a sequence to the sequence translation problem, borrowing models from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. Parameters describing the input, output and weight tensors are considered as the input language to the model that emits the corresponding kernel parameters. In essence, the model translates the problem parameter language to kernel parameter language. The core contributions of this work are: a) Proposing that a sequence to sequence model can accurately learn the performance dynamics of a GPU compute kernel b) A novel network architecture which predicts the kernel tuning parameters for GPU kernels, c) A constrained beam search which incorporates the physical limits of the GPU hardware as well as other expert knowledge reducing the search space. The proposed algorithm can achieve more than 90% accuracy on various convolutional kernels in MIOpen, the AMD machine learning primitives library. As a result, the proposed technique can reduce the development time and compute resources required to tune unseen input configurations, resulting in shorter development cycles, reduced development costs, and better user experience.">

Historically, optimization for a given application would be accomplished via a design of experiment (DOE) study across the various external control parameters. Machine learning (ML) techniques show the potential to “forecast” process conditions not tested in a traditional DOE study and thereby allow better optimization and control of a plasma tool. In this article, we have used standard DOE as well as ML predictions to analyze I-V data in a moderate-pressure CCP system. We have demonstrated that supervised regression ML techniques can be a useful tool for extrapolating data even when a plasma system is undergoing a transition in the heating mode, in this case from the alpha to gamma mode. Classification analysis of control parameters is another possible application of ML techniques that can be deployed for system control. Here, we show that given a large set of measured data, the models can identify the gas ratio in the feed gas as well as correctly identify the operating pressure and electrode gap in almost all the cases.">

        <tr id="Modeling tools aim to predict potential drug side effects, although they suffer from imperfect performance. Specifically, protein-protein interaction models predict drug effects from proteins surrounding drug targets, but they tend to overpredict drug phenotypes and require well-defined pathway phenotypes. In this study, we used PathFX, a protein-protein interaction tool, to predict side effects for active ingredient-side effect pairs extracted from drug labels. We observed limited performance and defined new pathway phenotypes using pathway engineering strategies. We defined new pathway phenotypes using a network-based and gene expression-based approach. Overall, we discovered a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity values and demonstrated a way to limit overprediction for side effects with sufficient true positive examples. We compared our predictions to animal models and demonstrated similar performance metrics, suggesting that protein-protein interaction models do not need perfect evaluation metrics to be useful. Pathway engineering, through the inclusion of true positive examples and omics measurements, emerges as a promising approach to enhance the utility of protein interaction network models for drug effect prediction.">

        <tr id="Various published COVID-19 models have been used in epidemiological studies and healthcare planning to model and predict the spread of the disease and appropriately realign health measures and priorities given the resource limitations in the field of healthcare. However, a significant issue arises when these models need help identifying the distribution of the constituent variants of COVID-19 infections. The emergence of such a challenge means that, given limited healthcare resources, health planning would be ineffective and cost lives. This work presents a universal neural network (NN) computational instrument for predicting the mainstream symptomatic infection rate of COVID-19 and models of the distribution of its associated variants. The NN is based on a mixture density network (MDN) with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) object as a backbone. Twelve use cases were used to demonstrate the validity and reliability of the proposed MDN. The use cases included COVID-19 data for Canada and Saudi Arabia, two date ranges (300 and 500 days), two input data modes, and three activation functions, each with different implementations of the batch size and epoch value. This array of scenarios provided an opportunity to investigate the impacts of epistemic uncertainty (EU) and aleatoric uncertainty (AU) on the prediction model’s fitting. The model accuracy readings were in the high nineties based on a tolerance margin of 0.0125. The primary outcome of this work indicates that this easy-to-use universal MDN helps provide reliable predictions of COVID-19 variant distributions and the corresponding synthesized profile of the mainstream infection rate.">

However, the high dimensionality of data and the lack of aligned samples across disease stages have posed challenges in addressing these tasks. We present a novel framework, Gaussian Graphical Optimal Transport (GGOT), for analyzing disease progressions. The proposed GGOT uses Gaussian graphical models, incorporating protein interaction networks, to characterize the data distributions at different disease stages. Then we use population-level optimal transport to calculate the Wasserstein distances and transport maps between stages, enabling us to detect critical transitions. By analyzing the per-molecule transport distance, we quantify the importance of each molecule and identify trigger molecules. Moreover, GGOT predicts the occurrence of critical transitions in unseen samples and visualizes the disease progression process. We apply GGOT to the simulation dataset and six disease datasets with varying disease progression rates, to show its effectiveness for detecting critical transitions and identifying trigger molecules.">

        <tr id="Intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity is nowadays understood to play a critical role in disease progression and treatment failure. Accordingly, there has been increasing interest in the development of mathematical models capable of capturing its role in cancer cell adaptation. This can be systematically achieved by means of models comprising phenotype-structured nonlocal partial differential equations, tracking the evolution of the phenotypic density distribution of the cell population, which may be compared to gene and protein expression distributions obtained experimentally. Nevertheless, given the high analytical and computational cost of solving these models, much is to be gained from reducing them to systems of ordinary differential equations for the moments of the distribution. We propose a generalised method of model-reduction, relying on the use of a moment generating function, Taylor series expansion and truncation closure, to reduce a nonlocal reaction-advection-diffusion equation, with general phenotypic drift and proliferation rate functions, to a system of moment equations up to arbitrary order. Our method extends previous results in the literature, which we address via two examples, by removing any \textit{a priori} assumption on the shape of the distribution, and provides a flexible framework for mathematical modellers to account for the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer adaptive dynamics, in a simpler mathematical framework.">

Despite these advanced capabilities and broad potential, the current study presents critical findings that question these models’ adherence to fundamental physical principles and its susceptibility to overfitting specific protein families.

These discrepancies reveal a significant divergence from expected physical behaviors, indicating potential overfitting to particular data subsets within its training corpus. Our findings underscore the models’ limitations in generalizing effectively across diverse biological structures and highlight the necessity of integrating robust physical and chemical priors in the development of such predictive tools.

In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of two different meta-learning methods, namely model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and adaptive deep kernel fitting (ADKF), specifically in the regression setting. We investigated how factors such as dataset size and the similarity of training tasks impact predictability. The results indicate that ADKF significantly outperformed both MAML and a single-task baseline model on the inhibition data. However, the performance of ADKF varied across different test tasks. Our findings suggest that considerable enhancements in performance can be anticipated primarily when the task of interest is similar to the tasks incorporated in the meta-learning process.">

        <tr id="A network, whose nodes are genes and whose directed edges represent positive or negative influences of a regulatory gene and its targets, is often used as a representation of causality. To infer a network, researchers often develop a machine learning model and then evaluate the model based on its match with experimentally verified “gold standard” edges. The desired result of such a model is a network that may extend the gold standard edges. Since networks are a form of visual representation, one can compare their utility with architectural or machine blueprints. Blueprints are clearly useful because they provide precise guidance to builders in construction. If the primary role of gene regulatory networks is to characterize causality, then such networks should be good tools of prediction because prediction is the actionable benefit of knowing causality. But are they? In this paper, we compare prediction quality based on “gold standard” regulatory edges from previous experimental work with non-linear models inferred from time series data across four different species. We show that the same non-linear machine learning models have better predictive performance, with improvements from 5.3% to 25.3% in terms of the reduction in the root mean square error (RMSE) compared with the same models based on the gold standard edges. Having established that networks fail to characterize causality properly, we suggest that causality research should focus on four goals: (i) predictive accuracy; (ii) a parsimonious enumeration of predictive regulatory genes for each target gene g; (iii) the identification of disjoint sets of predictive regulatory genes for each target g of roughly equal accuracy; and (iv) the construction of a bipartite network (whose node types are genes and models) representation of causality. We provide algorithms for all goals.">

        <tr id="In recent years, deep generative models have been successfully adopted for various molecular design tasks, particularly in the life and material sciences. A critical challenge for pre-trained generative molecular design (GMD) models is to fine-tune them to be better suited for downstream design tasks aimed at optimizing specific molecular properties. However, redesigning and training an existing effective generative model from scratch for each new design task is impractical. Furthermore, the black-box nature of typical downstream tasks$\unicode{x2013}$such as property prediction$\unicode{x2013}$makes it nontrivial to optimize the generative model in a task-specific manner. In this work, we propose a novel approach for a model uncertainty-guided fine-tuning of a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE)-based GMD model through performance feedback in an active learning setting. The main idea is to quantify model uncertainty in the generative model, which is made efficient by working within a low-dimensional active subspace of the high-dimensional VAE parameters explaining most of the variability in the model's output. The inclusion of model uncertainty expands the space of viable molecules through decoder diversity. We then explore the resulting model uncertainty class via black-box optimization made tractable by low-dimensionality of the active subspace. This enables us to identify and leverage a diverse set of high-performing models to generate enhanced molecules. Empirical results across six target molecular properties, using multiple VAE-based generative models, demonstrate that our uncertainty-guided fine-tuning approach consistently outperforms the original pre-trained models.">

        <tr id="Time series data in real-world scenarios contain a substantial amount of nonlinear information, which significantly interferes with the training process of models, leading to decreased prediction performance. Therefore, during the time series forecasting process, extracting the local and global time series patterns and understanding the potential nonlinear features among different time observations are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information at different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture potential nonlinear features among time observations. Building upon this, we propose ACNet, an adaptive convolutional network designed to effectively model the local and global temporal dependencies and the nonlinear features between observations in multivariate time series. Specifically, by extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, we capture both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed nonlinear feature adaptive extraction module captures the nonlinear features among different time observations in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ACNet across twelve real-world datasets. The results indicate that ACNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks with favorable runtime efficiency.">

        <tr id="Abstract In precision medicine, both predicting the disease susceptibility of an individual and forecasting its disease-free survival are areas of key research. Besides the classical epidemiological predictor variables, data from multiple (omic) platforms are increasingly available. To integrate this wealth of information, we propose new methodology to combine both cooperative learning, a recent approach to leverage the predictive power of several datasets, and polygenic hazard score models. Polygenic hazard score models provide a practitioner with a more differentiated view of the predicted disease-free survival than the one given by merely a point estimate, for instance computed with a polygenic risk score. Our aim is to leverage the advantages of cooperative learning for the computation of polygenic hazard score models via Cox’s proportional hazard model, thereby improving the prediction of the disease-free survival. In our experimental study, we apply our methodology to forecast the disease-free survival for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using three layers of data. One layer contains epidemiological variables such as sex, APOE (apolipoprotein E, a genetic risk factor for AD) status and 10 leading principal components. Another layer contains selected genomic loci, and the last layer contains methylation data for selected CpG sites. We demonstrate that the survival curves computed via cooperative learning yield an AUC of around \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} $0.7$\end{document}, above the state-of-the-art performance of its competitors. Importantly, the proposed methodology returns (1) a linear score that can be easily interpreted (in contrast to machine learning approaches), and (2) a weighting of the predictive power of the involved data layers, allowing for an assessment of the importance of each omic (or other) platform. Similarly to polygenic hazard score models, our methodology also allows one to compute individual survival curves for each patient.">

The accurate prediction and management of ADEs are crucial for improving the development of safer, more effective medications, and enhancing patient outcomes. To support this effort, we introduce CT-ADE, a novel dataset compiled to enhance the predictive modeling of ADEs. Encompassing over 12,000 instances extracted from clinical trial results, the CT-ADE dataset integrates drug, patient population, and contextual information for multilabel ADE classification tasks in monopharmacy treatments, providing a comprehensive resource for developing advanced predictive models. To mirror the complex nature of ADEs, annotations are standardized at the system organ class level of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) ontology. Preliminary analyses using baseline models have demonstrated promising results, achieving 73.33% F1 score and 81.54% balanced accuracy, highlighting CT-ADE's potential to advance ADE prediction. CT-ADE provides an essential tool for researchers aiming to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance patient safety and minimize the impact of ADEs on pharmaceutical research and development.

        <tr id="Randomized Clinical trials (RCT) suffer from a high failure rate which could be caused by heterogeneous responses to treatment. Despite many models being developed to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE), there remains a lack of interpretable methods to identify responsive subgroups. This work aims to develop a framework to identify subgroups based on treatment effects that prioritize model interpretability. The proposed framework leverages an ensemble uplift tree method to generate descriptive decision rules that separate samples given estimated responses to the treatment. Subsequently, we select a complementary set of these decision rules and rank them using a sparse linear model. To address the trial’s limited sample size problem, we proposed a data augmentation strategy by borrowing control patients from external studies and generating synthetic data. We apply the proposed framework to a failed randomized clinical trial for investigating an intracerebral hemorrhage therapy plan. The Qini-scores show that the proposed data augmentation strategy plan can boost the model’s performance and the framework achieves greater interpretability by selecting complementary descriptive rules without compromising estimation quality. Our model derives clinically meaningful subgroups. Specifically, we find those patients with Diastolic Blood Pressure≥70 mm hg and Systolic Blood Pressure<215 mm hg benefit more from intensive blood pressure reduction therapy. The proposed interpretable HTE analysis framework offers a promising potential for extracting meaningful insight from RCTs with neutral treatment effects. By identifying responsive subgroups, our framework can contribute to developing personalized treatment strategies for patients more efficiently.">

        <tr id="Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, with its heterogeneous and patient-specific nature complicating treatment. Immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint blockades (ICB), shows promising potential by reactivating the immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells. However, their effectiveness largely depends on the patient’s clinical and molecular characteristics, making them unsuitable for everyone. This highlights the importance of developing predictive and interpretable models that could distinguish potential responders from non-responders. This study aims to utilize gene expression data to predict patients’ responses to ICB and identify key genes whose expression is associated with treatment outcome using probabilistic Bayesian networks (BNs). To address the high-dimensional nature of gene expression data, we propose and compare the use of machine learning-based feature selection (FS) and clustering by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply BNs along with FS and WGCNA dimensionality reduction techniques to tackle ICB response using transcriptomic data. We achieved a maximal classification accuracy of 75% and identified eight genes and two gene clusters directly influencing ICB response. These results may offer more biological insights and mechanisms underlying ICB response. The proposed pipeline will contribute to guiding treatment decisions, minimizing harmful side effects, and reducing the financial costs associated with ineffective treatments.">

        <tr id="Identifying functionally important cell states and structure within a heterogeneous tumor remains a significant biological and computational challenge. Moreover, current clustering or trajectory-based computational models are ill-equipped to address the notion that cancer cells reside along a phenotypic continuum. To address this, we present Archetypal Analysis network (AAnet), a neural network that learns key archetypal cell states within a phenotypic continuum of cell states in single-cell data. Applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data from pre-clinical models and a cohort of 34 clinical breast cancers, AAnet identifies archetypes that resolve distinct biological cell states and processes, including cell proliferation, hypoxia, metabolism and immune interactions. Notably, archetypes identified in primary tumors are recapitulated in matched liver, lung and lymph node metastases, demonstrating that a significant component of intratumoral heterogeneity is driven by cell intrinsic properties. Using spatial transcriptomics as orthogonal validation, AAnet-derived archetypes show discrete spatial organization within tumors, supporting their distinct archetypal biology. We further reveal that ligand:receptor cross-talk between cancer and adjacent stromal cells contributes to intra-archetypal biological mimicry. Finally, we use AAnet archetype identifiers to validate GLUT3 as a critical mediator of a hypoxic cell archetype harboring a cancer stem cell population, which we validate in human triple-negative breast cancer specimens. AAnet is a powerful tool to reveal functional cell states within complex samples from multimodal single-cell data.">

        <tr id="Thyroid disease classification plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and effective treatment of thyroid disorders. Machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated remarkable potential in this domain, offering accurate and efficient diagnostic tools. Most of the real-life datasets have imbalanced characteristics that hamper the overall performance of the classifiers. Existing data balancing techniques process the whole dataset at a time that sometimes causes overfitting and underfitting. However, the complexity of some ML models, often referred to as “black boxes,” raises concerns about their interpretability and clinical applicability. This paper presents a comprehensive study focused on the analysis and interpretability of various ML models for classifying thyroid diseases. In our work, we first applied a new data-balancing mechanism using a clustering technique and then analyzed the performance of different ML algorithms. To address the interpretability challenge, we explored techniques for model explanation and feature importance analysis using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools globally as well as locally. Finally, the XAI results are validated with the domain experts. Experimental results have shown that our proposed mechanism is efficient in diagnosing thyroid disease and can explain the models effectively. The findings can contribute to bridging the gap between adopting advanced ML techniques and the clinical requirements of transparency and accountability in diagnostic decision-making.">

        <tr id="The purpose of this article is to infer patient level outcomes from population level randomized control trials (RCTs). In this pursuit, we utilize the recently proposed synthetic nearest neighbors (SNN) estimator. At its core, SNN leverages information across patients to impute missing data associated with each patient of interest. We focus on two types of missing data: (i) unrecorded outcomes from discontinuing the assigned treatments and (ii) unobserved outcomes associated with unassigned treatments. Data imputation in the former powers and de-biases RCTs, while data imputation in the latter simulates"synthetic RCTs"to predict the outcomes for each patient under every treatment. The SNN estimator is interpretable, transparent, and causally justified under a broad class of missing data scenarios. Relative to several standard methods, we empirically find that SNN performs well for the above two applications using Phase 3 clinical trial data on patients with Alzheimer's Disease. Our findings directly suggest that SNN can tackle a current pain point within the clinical trial workflow on patient dropouts and serve as a new tool towards the development of precision medicine. Building on our insights, we discuss how SNN can further generalize to real-world applications.">

However, identifying the most vital associations among features and outputs can be beset by a high degree of spurious connections due to indirect effects of various immune features propagating through an unmapped biological network. Here, we applied a probabilistic graphical modeling approach, Markov Fields, to empirically dissect the most direct associations correlations between features from a public multi-modal dataset (antibody titers, antibody-dependent functions, cytokines, cytometry) from macaques undergoing intravenous BCG vaccination—a promising vaccine strategy against the major public health threat tuberculosis. This yielded a network influence model that interprets the assemblage of multi-scale paths by which vaccine effects propagate through the immune network to eventually protect against tuberculosis infection. Importantly, our modeling shows that the vast majority of apparent correlations between features arise from indirect effects relating distant immune features. For a test of predictive capability, we conducted experimental depletion of B cells during BCG IV vaccination in macaques--which did not reduce BCG IV-mediated protection against tuberculosis— and validated that our Markov Field model can predict systems-wide modulation of numerous features across the immune system in response to this perturbation. Finally, we applied our model to discern perturbations in the network that could have strong effects on IV-BCG efficacy. All together, we have demonstrated that probabilistic graphical modeling can increase interpretability and predictive value of multi-modal datasets for identifying new disease treatment targets.

We next conducted experimental depletion of B cells during vaccination in macaques—which did not reduce protection against tuberculosis—to validate our Markov Field model’s predictions of network-wide shifts post-depletion. Finally, we highlight immune changes predicted to strongly affect intravenous BCG vaccine efficacy, showing that probabilistic graphical models increase the interpretability of multi-modal datasets for identifying new disease targets.">

        <tr id="Large Language Models (LLMs) have made great strides in areas such as language processing and computer vision. Despite the emergence of diverse techniques to improve few-shot learning capacity, current LLMs fall short in handling the languages in biology and chemistry. For example, they are struggling to capture the relationship between molecule structure and pharmacochemical properties. Consequently, the few-shot learning capacity of small-molecule drug modification remains impeded. In this work, we introduced DrugLLM, a LLM tailored for drug design. During the training process, we employed Group-based Molecular Representation (GMR) to represent molecules, arranging them in sequences that reflect modifications aimed at enhancing specific molecular properties. DrugLLM learns how to modify molecules in drug discovery by predicting the next molecule based on past modifications. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that DrugLLM can generate new molecules with expected properties based on limited examples, presenting a powerful few-shot molecule generation capacity.">

        <tr id="Abstract Motivation Systems biology aims to better understand living systems through mathematical modelling of experimental and clinical data. A pervasive challenge in quantitative dynamical modelling is the integration of time series measurements, which often have high variability and low sampling resolution. Approaches are required to utilize such information while consistently handling uncertainties. Results We present BayModTS (Bayesian modelling of time series data), a new FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) workflow for processing and analysing sparse and highly variable time series data. BayModTS consistently transfers uncertainties from data to model predictions, including process knowledge via parameterized models. Further, credible differences in the dynamics of different conditions can be identified by filtering noise. To demonstrate the power and versatility of BayModTS, we applied it to three hepatic datasets gathered from three different species and with different measurement techniques: (i) blood perfusion measurements by magnetic resonance imaging in rat livers after portal vein ligation, (ii) pharmacokinetic time series of different drugs in normal and steatotic mice, and (iii) CT-based volumetric assessment of human liver remnants after clinical liver resection. Availability and implementation The BayModTS codebase is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Systems-Theory-in-Systems-Biology/BayModTS. The repository contains a Python script for the executable BayModTS workflow and a widely applicable SBML (systems biology markup language) model for retarded transient functions. In addition, all examples from the paper are included in the repository. Data and code of the application examples are stored on DaRUS: https://doi.org/10.18419/darus-3876.

        <tr id="The dynamics of biological systems, from proteins to cells to organisms, is complex and stochastic. To decipher their physical laws, we need to bridge between experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Thanks to progress in microscopy and tracking, there is today an abundance of experimental trajectories reflecting these dynamical laws. Inferring physical models from noisy and imperfect experimental data, however, is challenging. Because there are no inference methods that are robust and efficient, model reconstruction from experimental trajectories is a bottleneck to data-driven biophysics. In this Thesis, I present a set of tools developed to bridge this gap and permit robust and universal inference of stochastic dynamical models from experimental trajectories. These methods are rooted in an information-theoretical framework that quantifies how much can be inferred from trajectories that are short, partial and noisy. They permit the efficient inference of dynamical models for overdamped and underdamped Langevin systems, as well as the inference of entropy production rates. I finally present early applications of these techniques, as well as future research directions.">

Whilst natural language processing (NLP) techniques have proven highly effective for protein sequence modelling, structure modelling presents a complex challenge, primarily due to its continuous and three-dimensional nature. Motivated by this discrepancy, we introduce an approach using a vector-quantized autoencoder that effectively tokenizes protein structures into discrete representations. This method transforms the continuous, complex space of protein structures into a manageable, discrete format with a codebook ranging from 4096 to 64000 tokens, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions with backbone root mean square deviations (RMSD) of approximately 1-5 \AA. To demonstrate the efficacy of our learned representations, we show that a simple GPT model trained on our codebooks can generate novel, diverse, and designable protein structures. Our approach not only provides representations of protein structure, but also mitigates the challenges of disparate modal representations and sets a foundation for seamless, multi-modal integration, enhancing the capabilities of computational methods in protein design.">

Previous studies have primarily concentrated on developing medication embeddings, achieving significant progress. Nonetheless, these approaches often fall short in accurately reflecting individual patient profiles, mainly due to challenges in distinguishing between various patient conditions and the inability to establish precise correlations between specific conditions and appropriate medications. In response to these issues, we introduce DisMed, a model that focuses on patient conditions to enhance personalization. DisMed employs causal inference to discern clear, quantifiable causal links. It then examines patient conditions in depth, recognizing and adapting to the evolving nuances of these conditions, and mapping them directly to corresponding medications. Additionally, DisMed leverages data from multiple patient visits to propose combinations of medications. Comprehensive testing on real-world datasets demonstrates that DisMed not only improves the customization of patient profiles but also surpasses leading models in both precision and safety.">

        <tr id="Stepwise covariate modeling (SCM) has a high computational burden and can select the wrong covariates. Machine learning (ML) has been proposed as a screening tool to improve the efficiency of covariate selection, but little is known about how to apply ML on actual clinical data. First, we simulated datasets based on clinical data to compare the performance of various ML and traditional pharmacometrics (PMX) techniques with and without accounting for highly-correlated covariates. This simulation step identified the ML algorithm and the number of top covariates to select when using the actual clinical data. A previously developed desipramine population-pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate virtual subjects. Fifteen covariates were considered with four having an effect included. Based on the F1 score (an accuracy measure), ridge regression was the most accurate ML technique on 200 simulated datasets (F1 score = 0.475 ± 0.231), a performance which almost doubled when highly-correlated covariates were accounted for (F1 score = 0.860 ± 0.158). These performances were better than forwards selection with SCM (F1 score = 0.251 ± 0.274 and 0.499 ± 0.381 without/with correlations respectively). In terms of computational cost, ridge regression (0.42 ± 0.07 seconds/simulated dataset, 1 thread) was ~20,000 times faster than SCM (2.30 ± 2.29 hours, 15 threads). On the clinical dataset, prescreening with the selected ML algorithm reduced SCM runtime by 42.86% (from 1.75 to 1.00 days) and produced the same final model as SCM only. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that accounting for highly-correlated covariates improves ML prescreening accuracy. The choice of ML method and the proportion of important covariates (unknown a priori) can be guided by simulations.">

        <tr id="Modern recordings of neural activity provide diverse observations of neurons across brain areas, behavioral conditions, and subjects -- thus presenting an exciting opportunity to reveal the fundamentals of brain-wide dynamics underlying cognitive function. Current methods, however, often fail to fully harness the richness of such data as they either provide an uninterpretable representation (e.g., via"black box"deep networks) or over-simplify the model (e.g., assume stationary dynamics or analyze each session independently). Here, instead of regarding asynchronous recordings that lack alignment in neural identity or brain areas as a limitation, we exploit these diverse views of the same brain system to learn a unified model of brain dynamics. We assume that brain observations stem from the joint activity of a set of functional neural ensembles (groups of co-active neurons) that are similar in functionality across recordings, and propose to discover the ensemble and their non-stationary dynamical interactions in a new model we term CrEIMBO (Cross-Ensemble Interactions in Multi-view Brain Observations). CrEIMBO identifies the composition of the per-session neural ensembles through graph-driven dictionary learning and models the ensemble dynamics as a latent sparse time-varying decomposition of global sub-circuits, thereby capturing non-stationary dynamics. CrEIMBO identifies multiple co-active sub-circuits while maintaining representation interpretability due to sharing sub-circuits across sessions. CrEIMBO distinguishes session-specific from global (session-invariant) computations by exploring when distinct sub-circuits are active. We demonstrate CrEIMBO's ability to recover ground truth components in synthetic data and uncover meaningful brain dynamics, capturing cross-subject and inter- and intra-area variability, in high-density electrode recordings of humans performing a memory task.">

        <tr id="Motivation: Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the early detection of genetic diseases and the development of personalized medicine. However, the variance explained by genetic variations is typically small compared to the heritability estimates. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop enhanced polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction models. We seek an approach that transcends the limitations of the routinely used additive model for PRS. Results: Here we present DROP-DEEP, a novel method for calculating PRS that enhances the explanation of the heritability variance of complex traits by incorporating high-dimensional genetic interactions. The first stage of DROP-DEEP employs an unsupervised approach to reduce dimensionality, while the second stage involves training a prediction model using a supervised machine-learning algorithm. Notably, the first stage of training is phenotype-agnostic. Thus, while it is computationally intensive, it is performed only once. Its output can serve as input for predicting any chosen trait or disease. We evaluated the efficacy of the DROP-DEEP dimensionality reduction models using principal component analysis (PCA) and deep neural networks (DNN). All models were trained using the UK Biobank (UKB) dataset with over 340,000 subjects and a set of approximately 460,000 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across the genome. The results of DROP-DEEP, which was established for patients diagnosed with hypertension, outperformed other approaches. We extended the analysis to include an additional five binary and continuous phenotypes, each repeated five times for reproducibility assessment. For each phenotype, DROP-DEEP results were compared to commonly used PRS methodologies, and the performance of all models was discussed. Conclusion: Our approach overcomes the need for variable selection while maintaining computational feasibility. We conclude that the DROP-DEEP approach exhibits significant advantages compared to commonly used PRS methods and can be used efficiently for hundreds of genetic traits.

        <tr id="Clinical variant classification of pathogenic versus benign genetic variants remains a challenge in clinical genetics. Recently, the proposition of genomic foundation models has improved the generic variant effect prediction (VEP) accuracy via weakly-supervised or unsupervised training. However, these VEPs are not disease-specific, limiting their adaptation at the point of care. To address this problem, we propose DYNA: Disease-specificity fine-tuning via a Siamese neural network broadly applicable to all genomic foundation models for more effective variant effect predictions in disease-specific contexts. We evaluate DYNA in two distinct disease-relevant tasks. For coding VEPs, we focus on various cardiovascular diseases, where gene-disease relationships of loss-of-function vs. gain-of-function dictate disease-specific VEP. For non-coding VEPs, we apply DYNA to an essential post-transcriptional regulatory axis of RNA splicing, the most common non-coding pathogenic mechanism in established clinical VEP guidelines. In both cases, DYNA fine-tunes various pre-trained genomic foundation models on small, rare variant sets. The DYNA fine-tuned models show superior performance in the held-out rare variant testing set and are further replicated in large, clinically-relevant variant annotations in ClinVAR. Thus, DYNA offers a potent disease-specific variant effect prediction method, excelling in intra-gene generalization and generalization to unseen genetic variants, making it particularly valuable for disease associations and clinical applicability.">

        <tr id="Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived neurons offer a valuable platform for studying neurological disorders in a patient-specific manner. These neurons can be rapidly differentiated into excitatory neuronal networks, whose activity is measurable using multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). Neuronal networks derived from patients exhibit distinct characteristics, reflecting underlying pathological molecular mechanisms. However, elucidating these mechanisms traditionally requires extensive and hypothesis-driven additional experiments. Computational models can link observable network activity to underlying molecular mechanisms by identifying biophysical model parameters that simulate the activity, but this identification process is challenging. Here, we address this challenge by using simulation-based inference (SBI), a machine-learning approach, to automatically identify the full range of model parameters able to explain the patient-derived MEA activity. Our study demonstrates that SBI can accurately identify ground-truth parameters in simulated data, and successfully estimate the parameters that replicate the network activity of healthy hiPSC-derived neuronal networks. Furthermore, we show that SBI can pinpoint molecular mechanisms affected by pharmacological agents and identify key disease mechanisms in neuronal networks derived from patients. These findings underscore the potential of SBI to automate and enhance the identification of disease mechanisms from MEA measurements, offering a robust and scalable method for advancing research with hiPSC-derived neuronal networks.">

In order to provide effective therapy and more favorable outcomes for patients, early detection and correct diagnosis are absolutely necessary. This research explores the integration of operational research (OR) methodologies and advanced statistical methods within machine learning frameworks to enhance the prediction accuracy of breast cancer outcomes. By harnessing the power of nonlinear optimization and statistical techniques, including regression analysis and probability distribution models, we aim to refine the predictive capabilities of existing algorithms. The research employs a comprehensive dataset derived from clinical trials and patient records, analyzed through a series of machine learning models that incorporate elements of combinatorial optimization, decision analysis, and stochastic modeling. Key performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, are evaluated against standard benchmarks to determine the efficacy of the integrated approaches. Preliminary results indicate that incorporating OR and statistical methods significantly improves model robustness and predictive accuracy.

        <tr id="Epilepsy is a complex disease spanning across multiple scales, from ion channels in neurons to neuronal circuits across the entire brain. Over the past decades, computational models have been used to describe the pathophysiological activity of the epileptic brain from different aspects. Traditionally, each computational model can aid in optimizing therapeutic interventions, therefore, providing a particular view to design strategies for treating epilepsy. As a result, most studies are concerned with generating specific models of the epileptic brain that can help us understand the certain machinery of the pathological state. Those specific models vary in complexity and biological accuracy, with system-level models often lacking biological details. Here, we review various types of computational models of epilepsy and discuss their potential for different therapeutic approaches and scenarios, including drug discovery, surgical strategies, brain stimulation, and seizure prediction. We propose that we need to consider an integrated approach with a unified modelling framework across multiple scales to understand the epileptic brain. Our proposal is based on the recent increase in computational power, which has opened up the possibility of unifying those specific epileptic models into simulations with an unprecedented level of detail. A multi-scale epilepsy model can bridge the gap between biologically detailed models, used to address molecular and cellular questions, and brain-wide models based on abstract models which can account for complex neurological and behavioral observations. With these efforts, we move toward the next generation of epileptic brain models capable of connecting cellular features, such as ion channel properties, with standard clinical measures such as seizure severity.">

        <tr id="Time-series data in real-world settings typically exhibit long-range dependencies and are observed at non-uniform intervals. In these settings, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose \textit{multi-view signature attention}, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Approximately 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, with many not achieving seizure freedom. Organ-on-chip technology, which mimics organ-level physiology, could revolutionize drug development for epilepsy by replacing animal models in preclinical studies. The authors’ goal is to determine if customized micro-physiological systems can lead to tailored drug treatments for epileptic patients. Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted utilizing various databases, including PubMed, Ebscohost, Medline, and the National Library of Medicine, using a predetermined search strategy. The authors focused on articles that addressed the role of personalized micro-physiological systems in individual drug responses and articles that discussed different types of epilepsy, diagnosis, and current treatment options. Additionally, articles that explored the components and design considerations of micro-physiological systems were reviewed to identify challenges and opportunities in drug development for challenging epilepsy cases. Results: The micro-physiological system offers a more accurate and cost-effective alternative to traditional models for assessing drug effects, toxicities, and disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, designing patient-specific models presents critical considerations, including the integration of analytical biosensors and patient-derived cells, while addressing regulatory, material, and biological complexities. Material selection, standardization, integration of vascular systems, cost efficiency, real-time monitoring, and ethical considerations are also crucial to the successful use of this technology in drug development. Conclusion: The future of organ-on-chip technology holds great promise, with the potential to integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning for personalized treatment of epileptic patients.">

        <tr id="Widespread deployment of societal-scale machine learning systems necessitates a thorough understanding of the resulting long-term effects these systems have on their environment, including loss of trustworthiness, bias amplification, and violation of AI safety requirements. We introduce a repeated learning process to jointly describe several phenomena attributed to unintended hidden feedback loops, such as error amplification, induced concept drift, echo chambers and others. The process comprises the entire cycle of obtaining the data, training the predictive model, and delivering predictions to end-users within a single mathematical model. A distinctive feature of such repeated learning setting is that the state of the environment becomes causally dependent on the learner itself over time, thus violating the usual assumptions about the data distribution. We present a novel dynamical systems model of the repeated learning process and prove the limiting set of probability distributions for positive and negative feedback loop modes of the system operation. We conduct a series of computational experiments using an exemplary supervised learning problem on two synthetic data sets. The results of the experiments correspond to the theoretical predictions derived from the dynamical model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for studying the repeated learning processes in machine learning systems and open a range of opportunities for further research in the area.">

        <tr id="Generating novel active molecules for a given protein is an extremely challenging task for generative models that requires an understanding of the complex physical interactions between the molecule and its environment. In this paper, we present a novel generative model, BindGPT which uses a conceptually simple but powerful approach to create 3D molecules within the protein's binding site. Our model produces molecular graphs and conformations jointly, eliminating the need for an extra graph reconstruction step. We pretrain BindGPT on a large-scale dataset and fine-tune it with reinforcement learning using scores from external simulation software. We demonstrate how a single pretrained language model can serve at the same time as a 3D molecular generative model, conformer generator conditioned on the molecular graph, and a pocket-conditioned 3D molecule generator. Notably, the model does not make any representational equivariance assumptions about the domain of generation. We show how such simple conceptual approach combined with pretraining and scaling can perform on par or better than the current best specialized diffusion models, language models, and graph neural networks while being two orders of magnitude cheaper to sample.">

In-silico modeling of bioelectrical networks can be performed using BETSE, an application that models gap junctions and ion channel activity of networked cells, but its usage of matrix-based differential equations to estimate these properties limits simulations based on the amount of computational resources available. To alleviate this issue, we trained a total of 8 machine learning models to replace three core functions of BETSE, that is, 1) predicting the average transmembrane potential (Vmem) of an entire cellular network, 2) predicting the Vmem of each individual cell within the network, and finally, 3) predicting the average ion concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium within the cell network. For objective 1, the random forest model was shown to be most performant over all 4 scoring metrics, in objective 2 both the decision tree and k-nearest neighbors models scored best in half of all metrics, and for objective 3 the super learner, a meta-learner comprised of multiple base learners, scored best among all scoring metrics. Overall, these models provide a more resource efficient method of predicting properties of bioelectric cellular networks, and future work will include further properties such as temperature and pressure.">

        <tr id="One of the central goals of neuroscience is to gain a mechanistic understanding of how the dynamics of neural circuits give rise to their observed function. A popular approach towards this end is to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to reproduce experimental recordings of neural activity. These trained RNNs are then treated as surrogate models of biological neural circuits, whose properties can be dissected via dynamical systems analysis. How reliable are the mechanistic insights derived from this procedure? While recent advances in population-level recording technologies have allowed simultaneous recording of up to tens of thousands of neurons, this represents only a tiny fraction of most cortical circuits. Here we show that observing only a subset of neurons in a circuit can create mechanistic mismatches between a simulated teacher network and a data-constrained student, even when the two networks have matching single-unit dynamics. In particular, partial observation of models of low-dimensional cortical dynamics based on functionally feedforward or low-rank connectivity can lead to surrogate models with spurious attractor structure. Our results illustrate the challenges inherent in accurately uncovering neural mechanisms from single-trial data, and suggest the need for new methods of validating data-constrained models for neural dynamics.">

However, traditional experimental methods for f5C detection are often laborious and time-consuming, limiting their ability to map f5C sites across the transcriptome comprehensively. While computational approaches offer a cost-effective and high-throughput alternative, no recognition model for f5C has been developed to date. Drawing inspiration from language models in natural language processing, this study presents f5C-finder, an ensemble neural network-based model utilizing multi-head attention for the identification of f5C. Five distinct feature extraction methods were employed to construct five individual artificial neural networks, and these networks were subsequently integrated through ensemble learning to create f5C-finder. 10-fold cross-validation and independent tests demonstrate that f5C-finder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with AUC of 0.807 and 0.827, respectively. The result highlights the effectiveness of biological language model in capturing both the order (sequential) and functional meaning (semantics) within genomes. Furthermore, the built-in interpretability allows us to understand what the model is learning, creating a bridge between identifying key sequential elements and a deeper exploration of their biological functions.">

        <tr id="Prevalent solution for BioNER involves using representation learning techniques coupled with sequence labeling. However, such methods are inherently task-specific, demonstrate poor generalizability, and often require dedicated model for each dataset. To leverage the versatile capabilities of recently remarkable large language models (LLMs), several endeavors have explored generative approaches to entity extraction. Yet, these approaches often fall short of the effectiveness of previouly sequence labeling approaches. In this paper, we utilize the open-sourced LLM LLaMA2 as the backbone model, and design specific instructions to distinguish between different types of entities and datasets. By combining the LLM's understanding of instructions with sequence labeling techniques, we use mix of datasets to train a model capable of extracting various types of entities. Given that the backbone LLMs lacks specialized medical knowledge, we also integrate external entity knowledge bases and employ instruction tuning to compel the model to densely recognize carefully curated entities. Our model VANER, trained with a small partition of parameters, significantly outperforms previous LLMs-based models and, for the first time, as a model based on LLM, surpasses the majority of conventional state-of-the-art BioNER systems, achieving the highest F1 scores across three datasets.">

        <tr id="Despite innumerable efforts to characterize C. elegans neural activity and behavior, the roles of each individual neuron and the compositional mechanisms of all their interactions are still not completely known. In particular, there is evidence that C. elegans neurons perform changing roles over time, in different behavioral contexts, etc.; however, existing stationary anatomical and functional connectivity can average across time and obfuscate the nonstationary nature of the neural dynamics. We contribute to these efforts by leveraging recent advances in decomposed linear dynamical systems (dLDS) models. dLDS models neural dynamics in a latent space with a set of linear operators that can be recombined and reused over time, enabling the discovery of multiple parallel neural processes on different timescales. We leverage the ability to identify reused patterns of dynamical neural interactions, which we call “dynamical connectivity,” to 1) identify contextually dependent roles of neurons; 2) discover the underlying variability of neural representations even under discrete behaviors; 3) quantify differences between anatomical, functional, and dynamical connectivity; and 4) learn a single aligned latent space underlying multiple individual worms’ activity. These results highlight the importance of defining a neuron’s functions not solely by its internal activity or place in a time-averaged network, but by its evolving interactions across context-dependent circuits.">

        <tr id="Epidemics are inherently stochastic, and stochastic models provide an appropriate way to describe and analyse such phenomena. Given temporal incidence data consisting of, for example, the number of new infections or removals in a given time window, a continuous-time discrete-valued Markov process provides a natural description of the dynamics of each model component, typically taken to be the number of susceptible, exposed, infected or removed individuals. Fitting the SEIR model to time-course data is a challenging problem due incomplete observations and, consequently, the intractability of the observed data likelihood. Whilst sampling based inference schemes such as Markov chain Monte Carlo are routinely applied, their computational cost typically restricts analysis to data sets of no more than a few thousand infective cases. Instead, we develop a sequential inference scheme that makes use of a computationally cheap approximation of the most natural Markov process model. Crucially, the resulting model allows a tractable conditional parameter posterior which can be summarised in terms of a set of low dimensional statistics. This is used to rejuvenate parameter samples in conjunction with a novel bridge construct for propagating state trajectories conditional on the next observation of cumulative incidence. The resulting inference framework also allows for stochastic infection and reporting rates. We illustrate our approach using synthetic and real data applications.">

By avoiding placing strong parametric assumptions on the event density, this approach tends to improve prediction performance, particularly when data are plentiful. However, in clinical settings with limited available data, it is often preferable to judiciously partition the event time space into a limited number of intervals well suited to the prediction task at hand. In this work, we develop Adaptive Discretization for Event PredicTion (ADEPT) to learn from data a set of cut points defining such a partition. We show that in two simulated datasets, we are able to recover intervals that match the underlying generative model. We then demonstrate improved prediction performance on three real-world observational datasets, including a large, newly harmonized stroke risk prediction dataset. Finally, we argue that our approach facilitates clinical decision-making by suggesting time intervals that are most appropriate for each task, in the sense that they facilitate more accurate risk prediction.">

In this work, we propose $\texttt{MiniMol}$, a foundational model for molecular learning with 10 million parameters. $\texttt{MiniMol}$ is pre-trained on a mix of roughly 3300 sparsely defined graph- and node-level tasks of both quantum and biological nature. The pre-training dataset includes approximately 6 million molecules and 500 million labels. To demonstrate the generalizability of $\texttt{MiniMol}$ across tasks, we evaluate it on downstream tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC) ADMET group showing significant improvements over the prior state-of-the-art foundation model across 17 tasks. $\texttt{MiniMol}$ will be a public and open-sourced model for future research.">

        <tr id="Plasma medicine has attracted tremendous interest in a variety of medical conditions, ranging from wound healing to antimicrobial applications, even in cancer treatment, through the interactions of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) and various biological tissues directly or indirectly. The underlying mechanisms of CAP treatment are still poorly understood although the oxidative effects of CAP with amino acids, peptides, and proteins have been explored experimentally. In this study, machine learning (ML) technology is introduced to efficiently unveil the interaction mechanisms of amino acids and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in seconds based on the data obtained from the reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are performed to probe the interaction of five types of amino acids with various ROS on the timescale of hundreds of picoseconds but with the huge computational load of several days. The oxidative reactions typically start with H‐abstraction, and the details of the breaking and formation of chemical bonds are revealed; the modification types, such as nitrosylation, hydroxylation, and carbonylation, can be observed. The dose effects of ROS are also investigated by varying the number of ROS in the simulation box, indicating agreement with the experimental observation. To overcome the limits of timescales and the size of molecular systems in reactive MD simulations, a deep neural network (DNN) with five hidden layers is constructed according to the reaction data and employed to predict the type of oxidative modification and the probability of occurrence only in seconds as the dose of ROS varies. The well‐trained DNN can effectively and accurately predict the oxidative processes and productions, which greatly improves the computational efficiency by almost ten orders of magnitude compared with the reactive MD simulation. This study shows the great potential of ML technology to efficiently unveil the underpinning mechanisms in plasma medicine based on the data from reactive MD simulations or experimental measurements.">

Integrating large-scale multi-omics epigenomic data enables the elucidation of the complex epigenomic control patterns of regulatory elements and regulators. Here, we propose TRAPT, a multi-modality deep learning framework that predicts functional transcriptional regulators from a queried gene set by integrating large-scale multi-omics epigenomic data, including histone modifications, ATAC-seq and TR-ChIP-seq. We design two-stage self-knowledge distillation model to learn nonlinear embedded representation of upstream and downstream regulatory element activity, and merge multi-modality epigenomic features from TR and the queried gene sets for inferring regulator activity. Experimental results on 1072 TR-related datasets demonstrate that TRAPT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in predicting transcriptional regulators, especially in the prediction of transcription co-factors and chromatin regulators. Additionally, we have successfully identified key transcriptional regulators associated with the disease, genetic variation, cell fate decisions, and tissues. Our method provides an innovative perspective for integrating epigenomic data and has the potential to significantly assist researchers in deepening their understanding of gene expression regulation mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Many clinical trials generate both longitudinal biomarker and time-to-event data. We might be interested in their relationship, as in the case of tumor size and overall survival in oncology drug development. Many well-established methods exist for analyzing such data either sequentially (two-stage models) or simultaneously (joint models). Two-stage modeling (2stgM) has been challenged (i) for not acknowledging that biomarkers are endogenous covariable to the survival submodel and (ii) for not propagating the uncertainty of the longitudinal biomarker submodel to the survival submodel. On the other hand, joint modeling (JM), which properly circumvents both problems, has been criticized for being time-consuming, and difficult to use in practice. In this paper, we explore a third approach, referred to as a novel two-stage modeling (N2stgM). This strategy reduces the model complexity without compromising the parameter estimate accuracy. The three approaches (2stgM, JM, and N2stgM) are formulated, and a Bayesian framework is considered for their implementation. Both real and simulated data were used to analyze the performance of such approaches. In all scenarios, our proposal estimated the parameters approximately as JM but without being computationally expensive, while 2stgM produced biased results.">

 In the real world, many dynamic behaviors can be explained by the propagation of perturbations, such as the transfer of chemical signals and the spread of infectious diseases. Previous researchers have achieved excellent results in approximating the global propagation time, revealing the mechanism of signal propagation through multiple paths. However, the known frameworks rely on the extension of physical concepts rather than mathematically rigorous derivations. As a result, they may not perfectly predict time or explain the underlying physical significance in certain specific cases. In this paper, we propose a novel method for decomposing network topology, focusing on two modules: the tree-like module and the path-module. Subsequently, we introduce a new framework for signal propagation analysis, which can be applied to estimate the propagation time for two fundamental global topology modules and provide a rigorous proof for the propagation time in global topology. Compared to previous work, our results are not only more concise, clearly defined, efficient, but also are more powerful in predicting propagation time which outperforms some known results in some cases, for example, biochemical dynamics. Additionally, the proposed framework is based on information transfer pathways, which can be also applied to other physical fields, such as network stability, network controlling and network resilience.">

        <tr id="1614 Background: Despite the unique ability of machine learning (ML) techniques to uncover complex interactive effects in datasets, studies exploring predictors of clinical trial enrollment have largely used standard statistical methods to discern associations. Furthermore, there have been limited applications of ML to close existing disparities in clinical trial enrollment of underrepresented patients in neuro-oncology. This study aims to use supervised machine learning to define and validate primary contributors of therapeutic clinical trial enrollment for a) all patients, b) women and c) NIH-designated minority patients with low- and high-grade glioma. Methods: Adult glioma patients who received care from the UCSF Brain Tumor Center between 1997- 2017 were identified in a prospective registry. Bootstrap forest (BF) and Recursive Partitioning (RP) models were created by randomly dividing patients in a 70/30 split into development (DEV) and validation (VAL) cohorts among all patients, women, and NIH-designated minority patients, separately. Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) in the DEV and VAL cohorts. Results: Among 1042 patients, 350 patients (33.6%) enrolled in a therapeutic clinical trial. There were 445 women (42.7%), of which 144 (32.4%) enrolled, and 141 minority patients (13.5%), of which 39 (27.7%) enrolled. For all patients, in order of decreasing influence, the BF model selected median neighborhood household income, age, neighborhood poverty level, distance from hospital, tumor location, tumor volume, treatment with chemotherapy, occupation, KPS, insurance status, employment status, seizure at presentation, and volumetric extent of resection (EOR) to predict trial enrollment (DEV AUC: 0.984; VAL AUC: 0.746). For women, the BF model selected distance from hospital, age, household income, neighborhood poverty level, tumor location, treatment with chemotherapy, and KPS for trial prediction (DEV AUC: 0.972; VAL AUC: 0.746), whereas for minority patients, the BF model selected neighborhood poverty level, age, occupation, distance from hospital, tumor volume, insurance status, employment status, and EOR to predict trial enrollment (DEV AUC: 0.9830; VAL AUC: 0.769). The RP model for women designated those with non-White race as less likely to enroll (DEV AUC: 0.735; VAL AUC: 0.665) while the RP model for minority patients characterized those who preferred a non-English language or who were divorced or widowed as less likely to enroll (DEV AUC: 0.775; VAL AUC: 0.601). Conclusions: Supervised machine learning models achieved similar predictive performance among patient subgroups, while uncovering interactions between gender identity, minority status, and sociodemographic variables. These findings can guide targeted recruiting efforts to advance equitable trial enrollment for women and minorities.">

One group of methods that has seemingly been under-utilised in this area is tensor factorisation, despite their clear applicability to this type of data. In this work, we apply three such models to a benchmark dataset in order to compare them against established techniques.

        <tr id="Breast cancer remains a significant public health issue worldwide, underlining the need for accurate and efficient diagnostic methods. In this paper, we propose a new technique to enhance breast cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple machine-learning models. Our strategy employs a combination of the Naive Bayes classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Bagging, and the ZeroR classifier, alongside Bayes Network learning. The cornerstone of our approach is Bayes Network learning, a probabilistic graphical model designed to map out the intricate interconnections among various diagnostic factors. This is significant in the way that it can help to uncover complex relationships in the data for the sake of leading to more accurate predictions. Added to the above, we use the Naïve Bayes classifier, a classifier showing good validity in classification tasks and based on probabilistic reasoning, for the screening of breast cancer. Further, a refined model's parameter is included using the SGD and leads to enhancement of the generalization and overall performance of the model. In addition, as part of controlling overfitting, one can also use Bagging. It is an ensemble method in the sense that it considers several models. ZeroR classifier is a very basic classifier and is just used to compare its performance with our composite approach. We are comparing complex ensemble results to its simplicity. We will validate the ability of our proposed methodology to compare the performance of our integrated models against ZeroR.">

        <tr id="The presence of interference, where the outcome of an individual may depend on the treatment assignment and behavior of neighboring nodes, can lead to biased causal effect estimation. Current approaches to network experiment design focus on limiting interference through cluster-based randomization, in which clusters are identified using graph clustering, and cluster randomization dictates the node assignment to treatment and control. However, cluster-based randomization approaches perform poorly when interference propagates in cascades, whereby the response of individuals to treatment propagates to their multi-hop neighbors. When we have knowledge of the cascade seed nodes, we can leverage this interference structure to mitigate the resulting causal effect estimation bias. With this goal, we propose a cascade-based network experiment design that initiates treatment assignment from the cascade seed node and propagates the assignment to their multi-hop neighbors to limit interference during cascade growth and thereby reduce the overall causal effect estimation error. Our extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in estimating causal effects in network data.">

Here, we explored more possibilities about it and developed the R package CWGCNA (causal WGCNA), which works from the traditional WGCNA pipeline but mines more information. It couples a mediation model with WGCNA, so the causal relationships among WGCNA modules, module features, and phenotypes can be found, demonstrating whether the module change causes the phenotype change or vice versa. After that, when annotating the module gene set functions, it uses a novel network-based method, considering the modules' topological structures and capturing their influence on the gene set functions. In addition to conducting these biological explorations, CWGCNA also contains a machine learning section to perform clustering and classification on multi-omics data, given the increasing popularity of this data type. Some basic functions, such as differential feature identification, are also available in our package. Its effectiveness is proved by the performance on three single or multi-omics datasets, showing better performance than existing methods.

We present an extension to the ARGOS framework, ARGOS-RAL, which leverages sparse regression with the recurrent adaptive lasso to identify PDEs from limited prior knowledge automatically. Our method automates calculating partial derivatives, constructing a candidate library, and estimating a sparse model. We rigorously evaluate the performance of ARGOS-RAL in identifying canonical PDEs under various noise levels and sample sizes, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy and non-uniformly distributed data. We also test the algorithm's performance on datasets consisting solely of random noise to simulate scenarios with severely compromised data quality. Our results show that ARGOS-RAL effectively and reliably identifies the underlying PDEs from data, outperforming the sequential threshold ridge regression method in most cases. We highlight the potential of combining statistical methods, machine learning, and dynamical systems theory to automatically discover governing equations from collected data, streamlining the scientific modeling process.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Drug repositioning (DR) refers to a method used to find new targets for existing drugs. This method can effectively reduce the development cost of drugs, save time on drug development, and reduce the risks of drug design. The traditional experimental methods related to DR are time-consuming, expensive, and have a high failure rate. Several computational methods have been developed with the increase in data volume and computing power. In the last decade, matrix factorization (MF) methods have been widely used in DR issues. However, these methods still have some challenges. (1) The model easily falls into a bad local optimal solution due to the high noise and high missing rate in the data. (2) Single similarity information makes the learning power of the model insufficient in terms of identifying the potential associations accurately.


OBJECTIVE
We proposed self-paced learning with dual similarity information and MF (SPLDMF), which introduced the self-paced learning method and more information related to drugs and targets into the model to improve prediction performance.


METHODS
Combining self-paced learning first can effectively alleviate the model prone to fall into a bad local optimal solution because of the high noise and high data missing rate. Then, we incorporated more data into the model to improve the model's capacity for learning.


RESULTS
Our model achieved the best results on each dataset tested. For example, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the precision-recall curve of SPLDMF was 0.982 and 0.815, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.


CONCLUSION
The experimental results on five benchmark datasets and two extended datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in predicting drug-target interactions.">

        <tr id="With the development of high-throughput technologies, genomics datasets rapidly grow in size, including functional genomics data. This has allowed the training of large Deep Learning (DL) models to predict epigenetic readouts, such as protein binding or histone modifications, from genome sequences. However, large dataset sizes come at a price of data consistency, often aggregating results from a large number of studies, conducted under varying experimental conditions. While data from large-scale consortia are useful as they allow studying the effects of different biological conditions, they can also contain unwanted biases from confounding experimental factors. Here, we introduce Metadata-guided Feature Disentanglement (MFD) - an approach that allows disentangling biologically relevant features from potential technical biases. MFD incorporates target metadata into model training, by conditioning weights of the model output layer on different experimental factors. It then separates the factors into disjoint groups and enforces independence of the corresponding feature subspaces with an adversarially learned penalty. We show that the metadata-driven disentanglement approach allows for better model introspection, by connecting latent features to experimental factors, without compromising, or even improving performance in downstream tasks, such as enhancer prediction, or genetic variant discovery. The code for our implemementation is available at https://github.com/HealthML/MFD">

        <tr id="A good initialization of deep learning models is essential since it can help them converge better and faster. However, pretraining large models is unaffordable for many researchers, which makes a desired prediction for initial parameters more necessary nowadays. Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), one approach to predicting model parameters, have recently shown strong performance in initializing large vision models. Unfortunately, predicting parameters of very wide networks relies on copying small chunks of parameters multiple times and requires an extremely large number of parameters to support full prediction, which greatly hinders its adoption in practice. To address this limitation, we propose LoGAH (Low-rank GrAph Hypernetworks), a GHN with a low-rank parameter decoder that expands to significantly wider networks without requiring as excessive increase of parameters as in previous attempts. LoGAH allows us to predict the parameters of 774-million large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner. We show that vision and language models (i.e., ViT and GPT-2) initialized with LoGAH achieve better performance than those initialized randomly or using existing hypernetworks. Furthermore, we show promising transfer learning results w.r.t. training LoGAH on small datasets and using the predicted parameters to initialize for larger tasks.

        <tr id="Extensive evidence recognizes that proteins associated with several diseases frequently interact with each other. This leads to develop different network-based methods for uncovering the molecular workings of human diseases. These methods are based on the idea that protein interaction networks act as maps, where diseases manifest as localized perturbations within a neighborhood. Identifying these areas, known as disease modules, is essential for in-depth research into specific disease characteristics. While many computational methods have been developed the underlying connectivity patterns within these modules still yet to be explored. This work aim to fill this gap by integrating multiple biological data sources through non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) technique. We leverage two biological sources of information, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and Gene Ontology data to find connections between novel genes and diseases. The data sources are first converted into networks, which are then clustered to obtain modules. Two types of modules are then integrated through NMF-based technique to obtain a set of meta-modules which preserve the essential characteristics of interaction patterns and functional similarity information among the proteins/genes. We assign multiple labels to each meta-module based on the statistical and biological properties they shared with the disease dataset. A multi-label classification technique is utilized to assign new disease labels to genes within each meta-modules. A total of 3131 gene-disease associations are identified, which are also validated through a literature survey, gene ontology and pathway-based analysis.">

The extracted model is used together with a deep reinforcement learning network that learns the optimal stepwise actions to predict future states of the original nonlinear system.

Here we seek to apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery. Comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs) are often used to evaluate cellular engineering strategies to optimise target compound production. However, predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs, often due to errors in the models. The task of learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models to reliably engineer biological systems for producing useful compounds. It offers a realistic approach to creating a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.">

        <tr id="Inferring causal protein signalling networks from human immune system cell data is a promising approach to unravel the underlying tissue signalling biology and dysfunction in diseased cells, which has attracted considerable attention within the bioinformatics field. Recently, Bayesian network (BN) techniques have gained significant popularity in inferring causal protein signalling networks from multiparameter single‐cell data. However, current BN methods may exhibit high computational complexity and ignore interactions among protein signalling molecules from different single cells. A novel BN method is presented for learning causal protein signalling networks based on parallel discrete artificial bee colony (PDABC), named PDABC. Specifically, PDABC is a score‐based BN method that utilises the parallel artificial bee colony to search for the global optimal causal protein signalling networks with the highest discrete K2 metric. The experimental results on several simulated datasets, as well as a previously published multi‐parameter fluorescence‐activated cell sorter dataset, indicate that PDABC surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art methods in terms of performance and computational efficiency.">

Our algorithm estimates these low dimensional matrices that capture the heterogeneity of the networks, learns the underlying manifold by isomap, and consistently predicts the response at an unlabeled network.

Construction of novel chemical systems with such finely-tuned dynamics is a challenging problem central to the growing field of synthetic biology. In this paper, we address this problem by putting forward a molecular version of a recurrent artificial neural network, which we call a recurrent neural chemical reaction network (RNCRN). We prove that the RNCRN, with sufficiently many auxiliary chemical species and suitable fast reactions, can be systematically trained to achieve any dynamics. This approximation ability is shown to hold independent of the initial conditions for the auxiliary species, making the RNCRN more experimentally feasible. To demonstrate the results, we present a number of relatively simple RNCRNs trained to display a variety of biologically-important dynamical features.">

        <tr id="Contemporary radiation risk assessment predominantly depends on nonlinear parametric models, which typically include a baseline term, a dose-response term, and an effect modifier term. Despite their widespread application in estimating tumor risks, parametric models face a notable drawback: their rigid model structure can be overly restrictive, potentially introducing bias and inaccuracies into risk estimations. In this study, we analyze data on solid tumors and leukemia from the Life Span Study (LSS) to compare the performance of deep neural network (DNN) and nonlinear parametric (NLP) models in assessing ERRs. DNN presents novel perspectives for radiation risk assessment. Our findings indicate that DNN can perform better than the traditional parametric models. Even if DNN and NLP models exhibit similar performance in predicting tumor incidence, they diverge significantly in their estimated ERRs. Standard NLP models tend to underestimate ERRs directly linked to radiation dose, overestimate ERRs for individuals at younger attained ages and ages at exposure, and underestimate ERRs for those at older attained ages. Furthermore, DNN consistently identifies radiation dose as the primary and predominant risk factor for ERRs in leukemia and solid tumors, underscoring the critical role of radiation dose in risk assessment. The insights from DNN could enhance low-dose radiation risk assessment and improve parametric model development.">

        <tr id="Computational pathology, utilizing whole slide image (WSI) for pathological diagnosis, has advanced the development of intelligent healthcare. However, the scarcity of annotated data and histological differences hinder the general application of existing methods. Extensive histopathological data and the robustness of self-supervised models in small-scale data demonstrate promising prospects for developing foundation pathology models. In this work, we propose the BEPH (BEiT-based model Pre-training on Histopathological image), a general method that leverages self-supervised learning to learn meaningful representations from 11 million unlabeled histopathological images. These representations are then efficiently adapted to various tasks, including patch-level cancer recognition, WSI-level cancer classification, and survival prediction for multiple cancer subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms several comparative models, even with limited training data reduced to 50%. Especially when the downstream structure is the same, the model can improve ResNet and DINO by up to a maximum increase of 8.8% and 7.2% (WSI level classification), and 6.44% and 3.28% on average (survival prediction), respectively. Therefore, BEPH offers a universal solution to enhance model performance, reduce the burden of expert annotations, and enable widespread clinical applications of artificial intelligence. The code and models can be obtained at https://github.com/Zhcyoung/BEPH. And currently, online fine-tuning of WSI classification tasks is available for use on http://yulab-sjtu.natapp1.cc/BEPH.">

        <tr id="Understanding drug residence times in target proteins is key to improving drug efficacy and understanding target recognition in biochemistry. While drug residence time is just as important as binding affinity, atomiclevel understanding of drug residence times through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been difficult primarily due to the extremely long timescales. Recent advances in rare event sampling have allowed us to reach these timescales, yet predicting protein-ligand residence times remains a significant challenge. Here we present a semi-automated protocol to calculate the ligand residence times across 12 orders of magnitudes of timescales. In our proposed framework, we integrate a deep learning-based method, the state predictive information bottleneck (SPIB), to learn an approximate reaction coordinate (RC) and use it to guide the enhanced sampling method metadynamics. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by applying it to six different protein-ligand complexes with available benchmark residence times, including the dissociation of the widely studied anti-cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) from both wild-type Abl kinase and drug-resistant mutants. We show how our protocol can recover quantitatively accurate residence times, potentially opening avenues for deeper insights into drug development possibilities and ligand recognition mechanisms.

Resulting models are validated by predicting condition-specific TF effector concentrations and binding site motif strength based on differential gene expression data alone. We show how reconstructed promoter models can capture multi-scale regulation and disentangle regulator interactions, including resolving the apparent paradox where argR expression is positively correlated with its regulon despite being a repressor.

        <tr id="Scaling deep learning models has been at the heart of recent revolutions in language modelling and image generation. Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 highly competitive downstream tasks, outclassing previous large models. This gives rise to MolGPS, a new graph foundation model that allows to navigate the chemical space, outperforming the previous state-of-the-arts on 26 out the 38 downstream tasks. We hope that our work paves the way for an era where foundational GNNs drive pharmaceutical drug discovery.">

In this work, we investigate this problem from an information theoretic perspective and show that most existing measures of explainability may suffer from trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet practical objective function for time series explainable learning. The design of the objective function builds upon the principle of information bottleneck (IB), and modifies the IB objective function to avoid trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. We further present TimeX++, a novel explanation framework that leverages a parametric network to produce explanation-embedded instances that are both in-distributed and label-preserving. We evaluate TimeX++ on both synthetic and real-world datasets comparing its performance against leading baselines, and validate its practical efficacy through case studies in a real-world environmental application. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that TimeX++ outperforms baselines across all datasets, demonstrating a substantial improvement in explanation quality for time series data.

Building on switching linear dynamical systems, we develop a new model that extends the switching linear dynamical systems for better discovering these dynamical modes. In the proposed model, the linear dynamics of latent variables can be described by a higher-order vector autoregressive process, which makes it feasible to evaluate the higher-order dependency relationships in the dynamics. In addition, the transition of switching states is determined by a stick-breaking logistic regression, overcoming the limitation of a restricted geometric state duration and recovering the symmetric dependency between the switching states and the latent variables from asymmetric relationships. Furthermore, logistic regression evidence potentials can appear as conditionally Gaussian potentials by utilizing the Pólya-gamma augmentation strategy. Filtering and smoothing algorithms and Bayesian inference for parameter learning in the proposed model are presented. The utility and versatility of the proposed model are demonstrated on synthetic data and public functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

        <tr id="Machine learning has the potential to provide tremendous value to life sciences by providing models that aid in the discovery of new molecules and reduce the time for new products to come to market. Chemical reactions play a significant role in these fields, but there is a lack of high-quality open-source chemical reaction data sets for training machine learning models. Herein, we present ORDerly, an open-source Python package for the customizable and reproducible preparation of reaction data stored in accordance with the increasingly popular Open Reaction Database (ORD) schema. We use ORDerly to clean United States patent data stored in ORD and generate data sets for forward prediction, retrosynthesis, as well as the first benchmark for reaction condition prediction. We train neural networks on data sets generated with ORDerly for condition prediction and show that data sets missing key cleaning steps can lead to silently overinflated performance metrics. Additionally, we train transformers for forward and retrosynthesis prediction and demonstrate how non-patent data can be used to evaluate model generalization. By providing a customizable open-source solution for cleaning and preparing large chemical reaction data, ORDerly is poised to push forward the boundaries of machine learning applications in chemistry.">

        <tr id="Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) is a groundbreaking model recently proposed by the MIT team, representing a revolutionary approach with the potential to be a game-changer in the field. This innovative concept has rapidly garnered worldwide interest within the AI community. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KAN utilizes spline-parametrized univariate functions in place of traditional linear weights, enabling them to dynamically learn activation patterns and significantly enhancing interpretability. In this paper, we explore the application of KAN to time series forecasting and propose two variants: T-KAN and MT-KAN. T-KAN is designed to detect concept drift within time series and can explain the nonlinear relationships between predictions and previous time steps through symbolic regression, making it highly interpretable in dynamically changing environments. MT-KAN, on the other hand, improves predictive performance by effectively uncovering and leveraging the complex relationships among variables in multivariate time series. Experiments validate the effectiveness of these approaches, demonstrating that T-KAN and MT-KAN significantly outperform traditional methods in time series forecasting tasks, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also improving model interpretability. This research opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, highlighting the potential of KAN as a powerful and interpretable tool in predictive analytics.">

 Understanding the dynamics of spreading and diffusion on networks is of critical importance for a variety of processes in real life. However, predicting the temporal evolution of diffusion on networks remains challenging as the process is shaped by network topology, spreading non-linearities, and heterogeneous adaptation behavior. In this study, we propose the spindle vector, a new network topological feature, which shapes nodes according to the distance from the root node. The spindle vector captures the relative order of nodes in diffusion propagation, thus allowing us to approximate the spatiotemporal evolution of diffusion dynamics on networks. The approximation simplifies the detailed connections of node pairs by only focusing on the nodal count within individual layers and the interlayer connections, seeking a compromise between efficiency and complexity. Through experiments on various networks, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on BA networks with an average improvement of 38.6% on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Additionally, the predictive accuracy of our method exhibits a notable convergence with the Pairwise Approximation (PA) approach with the increasing presence of quadrangles and pentagons in WS networks. The new metric provides a general and computationally efficient approach to predict network diffusion problems and is of potential for a large range of network applications.">

        <tr id="e15170 Background: A key goal in precision oncology is to develop predictive biomarkers that can identify patients likely to benefit from a given treatment. The main hurdle for generating such biomarkers is the availability of datasets that match predictive features for each patient (clinical, omics etc.) with treatment and individual outcome data. Such datasets are hard to obtain for approved drugs, and nonexistent for drugs in development. In contrast, there is ample data matching predictive features with survival data, but methods that use such data to develop and validate drug-specific predictive biomarkers are lacking. Here, we introduce a method termed the Surrogate Clinical Outcome Test (SCOT), which assesses, using non-interventional data, whether a drug-specific biomarker will be beneficial in clinical settings. Together with our previously published ENLIGHT platform, this enables early development and validation of predictive biomarkers. Methods: The SCOT test assumes that a patient population that exhibits low expression of the drug target(s) can serve as a surrogate for patients receiving the investigated drug, in the sense that survival dependency on the biomarker score would be similar to that of patients with the same features who actually receive the drug. Hence, a good predictive marker will be characterized by a negative hazard ratio in this population. To ensure that the marker is drug-specific and not merely prognostic, cases for which the same is true also in the population with high target expression should not pass the test. We studied 6 targeted drugs for which interventional clinical data is available. We used SCOT to classify two known prognostic biomarkers, as well as drug-specific transcriptomic biomarkers developed by our ENLIGHT algorithm, and compared the classifications to marker predictivities on the interventional clinical datasets. Results: Of the 6 drug-specific biomarkers developed by ENLIGHT, SCOT classified 4 as predictive of response to the respective drug, one as prognostic, and one as neither. The classification of 4 of these 6 biomarkers was confirmed by the interventional data (67% accuracy). The two prognostic markers - KI67 and Proliferation Index - were identified by SCOT as such. That is, SCOT found an association between these two markers and survival, regardless of target expression, for targets of the 6 drugs tested. Conclusions: Our work presents a novel method to test predictive markers for virtually any targeted cancer drug using big non-interventional clinical data. A key feature of this method is that it offers an independent validation of predictive markers for drugs, based on human clinical data, even before the drug enters clinical development. Combined with our ENLIGHT platform for generating predictive biomarkers in the absence of direct response data, this creates a powerful pipeline for early biomarker development and validation.">

To solve this, we introduce OptPDE, a first-of-its-kind machine learning approach that Optimizes PDEs' coefficients to maximize their number of conserved quantities, $n_{\rm CQ}$, and thus discover new integrable systems. We discover four families of integrable PDEs, one of which was previously known, and three of which have at least one conserved quantity but are new to the literature to the best of our knowledge. We investigate more deeply the properties of one of these novel PDE families, $u_t = (u_x+a^2u_{xxx})^3$. Our paper offers a promising schema of AI-human collaboration for integrable system discovery: machine learning generates interpretable hypotheses for possible integrable systems, which human scientists can verify and analyze, to truly close the discovery loop.">

Generative large language models (LLMs) are a subset of transformers-based neural network architecture models. LLMs have successfully leveraged a combination of an increased number of parameters, improvements in computational efficiency, and large pre-training datasets to perform a wide spectrum of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Using a few examples (few-shot) or no examples (zero-shot) for prompt-tuning has enabled LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a broad range of NLP applications. This article by the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) NLP Working Group characterizes the opportunities, challenges, and best practices for our community to leverage and advance the integration of LLMs in downstream NLP applications effectively. This can be accomplished through a variety of approaches, including augmented prompting, instruction prompt tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).


TARGET AUDIENCE
Our focus is on making LLMs accessible to the broader biomedical informatics community, including clinicians and researchers who may be unfamiliar with NLP. Additionally, NLP practitioners may gain insight from the described best practices.


SCOPE
We focus on 3 broad categories of NLP tasks, namely natural language understanding, natural language inferencing, and natural language generation. We review the emerging trends in prompt tuning, instruction fine-tuning, and evaluation metrics used for LLMs while drawing attention to several issues that impact biomedical NLP applications, including falsehoods in generated text (confabulation/hallucinations), toxicity, and dataset contamination leading to overfitting. We also review potential approaches to address some of these current challenges in LLMs, such as chain of thought prompting, and the phenomena of emergent capabilities observed in LLMs that can be leveraged to address complex NLP challenge in biomedical applications.">

        <tr id="Mitomycin-C (MMC) chemotherapy is a well-established anti-cancer treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, despite comprehensive biological research, the complete mechanism of action and an ideal regimen of MMC have not been elucidated. In this study, we present a theoretical investigation of NMIBC growth and its treatment by continuous administration of MMC chemotherapy. Using temporal ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe cell populations and drug molecules, we formulated the first mathematical model of tumor-immune interactions in the treatment of MMC for NMIBC, based on biological sources. Several hypothetical scenarios for NMIBC under the assumption that tumor size correlates with cell count are presented, depicting the evolution of tumors classified as small, medium, and large. These scenarios align qualitatively with clinical observations of lower recurrence rates for tumor size ≤ 30[mm] with MMC treatment, demonstrating that cure appears up to a theoretical x[mm] tumor size threshold, given specific parameters within a feasible biological range. The unique use of mole units allows to introduce a new method for theoretical pre-treatment assessments by determining MMC drug doses required for a cure. In this way, our approach provides initial steps toward personalized MMC chemotherapy for NMIBC patients, offering the possibility of new insights and potentially holding the key to unlocking some of its mysteries.">

However, the discovery of catalysts faces challenges due to the absence of efficient approaches to navigating vast and high-dimensional structure and composition spaces. In this study, we propose a high-throughput computational catalyst screening approach integrating density functional theory (DFT) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). Within the BO framework, we propose an uncertainty-aware atomistic machine learning model, UPNet, which enables automated representation learning directly from high-dimensional catalyst structures and achieves principled uncertainty quantification. Utilizing a constrained expected improvement acquisition function, our BO framework simultaneously considers multiple evaluation criteria. Using the proposed methods, we explore catalyst discovery for the CO2 reduction reaction. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves high prediction accuracy, facilitates interpretable feature extraction, and enables multicriteria design optimization, leading to significant reduction of computing power and time (10x reduction of required DFT calculations) in high-performance catalyst discovery.">

        <tr id="e13620 Background: Accurate assessment of treatment response is fundamental to advancing cancer patient care, particularly in lung cancer, where treatment modalities are diverse and complex. The extraction of treatment response, particularly disease progression information, from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for several reasons: It facilitates generation of real-world evidence from real-world data, enables personalized treatment planning, and contributes to a broader understanding of cancer therapeutics. However, much of treatment response information is documented in free-text EHR notes and traditional methods of extracting such information from notes are labor-intensive, error-prone, and inefficient, presenting significant barriers to timely and accurate real-world evidence studies. The advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), presents a transformative opportunity to automate the extraction of treatment responses. Methods: We used a cohort of 1,953 primary lung cancer patients identified from UPMC Hillman Cancer Center cancer registry and retrieved ~113,000 clinical notes from UPMC clinical data warehouse. We focused on extracting disease progression information, following the RECIST guidelines which define progression as an increase in tumor size or cancer markers after therapy. We selected ~50 notes to perform manual annotations by an experienced oncologist and created a gold standard dataset to validate the NLP models. We fine-tuned a state-of-the-art open-source LLM named LLAMA-2 and compared against a traditional rule-based NLP system for the automated extraction of disease progression from notes. The process of fine-tuning involved adjusting the model's parameters specifically to improve its ability to recognize and classify instances of disease progression. Results: Our analysis demonstrated a significant enhancement in performance with the LLM compared to the traditional rule-based NLP system. LLM exhibited a remarkable increase in sensitivity by ~37%, indicating its superior ability to accurately identify disease progression. Additionally, the model maintained high specificity and PPV, achieving scores nearly comparable to the rule-based system but with a notable improvement in the F1-score by ~14%. Conclusions: Our research highlights the transformative potential of LLM-based NLP algorithms in automating the extraction of treatment responses from free-text EHRs. This methodology not only provides a scalable and efficient mechanism for processing large volumes of clinical text but also significantly enhances the accuracy of lung cancer treatment response assessments.

        <tr id="We investigate trends in the data-error scaling behavior of machine learning (ML) models trained on discrete combinatorial spaces that are prone-to-mutation, such as proteins or organic small molecules. We trained and evaluated kernel ridge regression machines using variable amounts of computationally generated training data. Our synthetic datasets comprise i) two na\"ive functions based on many-body theory; ii) binding energy estimates between a protein and a mutagenised peptide; and iii) solvation energies of two 6-heavy atom structural graphs. In contrast to typical data-error scaling, our results showed discontinuous monotonic phase transitions during learning, observed as rapid drops in the test error at particular thresholds of training data. We observed two learning regimes, which we call saturated and asymptotic decay, and found that they are conditioned by the level of complexity (i.e. number of mutations) enclosed in the training set. We show that during training on this class of problems, the predictions were clustered by the ML models employed in the calibration plots. Furthermore, we present an alternative strategy to normalize learning curves (LCs) and the concept of mutant based shuffling. This work has implications for machine learning on mutagenisable discrete spaces such as chemical properties or protein phenotype prediction, and improves basic understanding of concepts in statistical learning theory.">

        <tr id="Machine learning (ML) offers promising new approaches to tackle complex problems and has been increasingly adopted in chemical and materials sciences. Broadly speaking, ML models employ generic mathematical functions and attempt to learn essential physics and chemistry from a large amount of data. Consequently, because of the lack of physical or chemical principles in the functional form, the reliability of the predictions is oftentimes not guaranteed, particularly for data far out of distribution. It is critical to quantify the uncertainty in model predictions and understand how the uncertainty propagates to downstream chemical and materials applications. Herein, we review and categorize existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for atomistic ML under a united framework of probabilistic modeling with the aim of elucidating the similarities and differences between them. We also discuss performance metrics to evaluate the calibration, precision, accuracy, and efficiency of the UQ methods and techniques for model recalibration. In addition, we discuss uncertainty propagation (UP) in widely used simulation techniques in chemical and materials science, such as molecular dynamics and microkinetic modeling. We also provide remarks on the challenges and future opportunities of UQ and UP in atomistic ML.">

 Deep neural networks give us a powerful method to model the training dataset’s relationship between input and output. We can regard that as a complex adaptive system consisting of many artificial neurons that work as an adaptive memory as a whole. The network’s behavior is training dynamics with a feedback loop from the evaluation of the loss function. We already know the training response can be constant or shows power law-like aging in some ideal situations. However, we still have gaps between those findings and other complex phenomena, like network fragility. To fill the gap, we introduce a very simple network and analyze it. We show the training response consists of some different factors based on training stages, activation functions, or training methods. In addition, we show feature space reduction as an effect of stochastic training dynamics, which can result in network fragility. Finally, we discuss some complex phenomena of deep networks.">

        <tr id="The field of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has witnessed significant growth in recent years. Still, many CASP programs rely on large data sets to train neural networks, resulting in limitations due to the data quality and prior knowledge from chemists. In response, we propose Retrosynthesis Zero (ReSynZ), a reaction template-based method that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with reinforcement learning inspired by AlphaGo Zero. Unlike other single-step reaction template-based CASP methods, ReSynZ takes complete synthesis paths for complex molecules, determined by reaction rules, as input for training the neural network. ReSynZ enables neural networks trained with relatively small reaction data sets (tens of thousands of data) to generate multiple synthesis pathways for a target molecule and suggest possible reaction conditions. On multiple data sets of molecular retrosynthesis, ReSynZ demonstrates excellent predictive performance compared to existing algorithms. The advantages, such as self-improving model features, flexible reward settings, the potential to surpass human limitations in chemical synthesis route planning, and others, make ReSynZ a valuable tool in chemical synthesis design.">

It consists of a computational model that is calibrated to the patient and is dynamically updated using a stream of patient data. The underlying computational model is often, multi-state, stochastic, and combines different modeling platforms at different scales. Standard methods for data assimilation do not directly apply to such models. This is true in particular for ensemble Kalman filter (1, 2) methods, a common approach to such problems. This paper focuses on agent-based models (ABMs), a model type often used in biomedicine. The key challenge for any forecasting algorithm for this model type is to bridge the gap between (detailed) micro- and (summary) macrostates. This paper proposes a modified Kalman filter method to meet this challenge, providing a way to dynamically update the microstate of an ABM using patient measurements collected at the macro level.">

In this paper, we consider enzymatic stochastic reaction networks representing a multi-scale bioprocess mechanistic model that allows us to integrate disparate data from diverse production processes and leverage the information from existing macro-kinetic and genome-scale models. To support forward prediction and backward reasoning, we develop a convergent adjoint SA algorithm studying how the perturbations of model parameters and inputs (e.g., initial state) propagate through enzymatic reaction networks and impact on output trajectory predictions. This SA can provide a sample efficient and interpretable way to assess the sensitivities between inputs and outputs accounting for their causal dependencies. Our empirical study underscores the resilience of these sensitivities and illuminates a deeper comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms behind bioprocess through sensitivities.">

Our modeling approach prioritizes the careful definition of an appropriate graph to identify both time-invariant and time-varying connectivity patterns. We introduce a novel block-structured sparsity prior paired with a finite basis expansion, which together yield effective shrinkage and graph selection with efficient computations via a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Crucially, the model includes (one or more) graph changepoints, which are learned jointly with all model parameters and incorporate graph dynamics. Simulation studies demonstrate excellent graph selection capabilities, with significant improvements over competing methods.

        <tr id="In the realm of medicinal chemistry, the primary objective is to swiftly optimize a multitude of chemical properties of a set of compounds to yield a clinical candidate poised for clinical trials. In recent years, two computational techniques, machine learning (ML) and physics-based methods, have evolved substantially and are now frequently incorporated into the medicinal chemist’s toolbox to enhance the efficiency of both hit optimization and candidate design. Both computational methods come with their own set of limitations, and they are often used independently of each other. ML’s capability to screen extensive compound libraries expediently is tempered by its reliance on quality data, which can be scarce especially during early-stage optimization. Contrarily, physics-based approaches like free energy perturbation (FEP) are frequently constrained by low throughput and high cost by comparison; however, physics-based methods are capable of making highly accurate binding affinity predictions. In this study, we harnessed the strength of FEP to overcome data paucity in ML by generating virtual activity data sets which then inform the training of algorithms. Here, we show that ML algorithms trained with an FEP-augmented data set could achieve comparable predictive accuracy to data sets trained on experimental data from biological assays. Throughout the paper, we emphasize key mechanistic considerations that must be taken into account when aiming to augment data sets and lay the groundwork for successful implementation. Ultimately, the study advocates for the synergy of physics-based methods and ML to expedite the lead optimization process. We believe that the physics-based augmentation of ML will significantly benefit drug discovery, as these techniques continue to evolve.">

Introducing a novel approach to differential network analysis, we incorporate differential gene expression based on sex and gender attributes. We hypothesize that gene expression can be accurately represented through non-Gaussian processes. Our methodology involves quantifying changes in non-parametric correlations among gene pairs and expression levels of individual genes. Applying our method to public expression datasets concerning diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis in liver tissue, we identify gender-specific differential networks. Results underscore the biological relevance of our approach in uncovering meaningful molecular distinctions. Author summary This paper explores a novel technique for Differential Network Analysis (DNA) that considers sex-based variations. DNA compares biological networks under different conditions, like healthy vs. diseased states. Our method tackles the limitations of traditional DNA approaches, which often assume specific data distributions. We propose a non-parametric DNA methodology that integrates sex differences and identifies differential edges between networks. This approach utilizes data on gene expression levels and sex to construct a more accurate picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases, particularly those exhibiting sex-dependent variations. Our method paves the way for a deeper understanding of how sex and age influence disease processes at the molecular level.">

        <tr id="Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are relative measures of an individual's genetic propensity to a particular trait or disease. Most PRS methods assume that mutation effects scale linearly with the number of alleles and are constant across individuals. While these assumptions simplify computation, they increase error, particularly for less-represented racial groups. We developed and provide Delphi (deep learning for phenotype inference), a deep-learning method that relaxes these assumptions to produce more predictive PRS. In contrast to other methods, Delphi can integrate up to hundreds of thousands of SNPs as input. We compare our results to a standard, linear PRS model, lasso regression, and a gradient-boosted trees-based method. We show that deep learning can be an effective approach to genetic risk prediction. We report a relative increase in the percentage variance explained compared to the state-of-the-art by 11.4% for body mass index, 18.9% for systolic blood pressure, 7.5% for LDL, 35% for C-reactive protein, 16.2% for height, 29.6% for pulse rate; in addition, Delphi provides 2% absolute explained variance for blood glucose while other tested methods were non-predictive. Furthermore, we show that Delphi tends to increase the weight of high-effect mutations. This work demonstrates an effective deep learning method for modeling genetic risk that also showed to generalize well when evaluated on individuals from non-European ancestries.">

        <tr id="The crisis of antibiotic resistance has become a significant global threat to human health. Understanding properties of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is the first step to mitigate this issue. Although many methods have been proposed for predicting properties of ARGs, most of these methods focus only on predicting antibiotic classes, while ignoring other properties of ARGs, such as resistance mechanisms and transferability. However, acquiring all of these properties of ARGs can help researchers gain a more comprehensive understanding of the essence of antibiotic resistance, which will facilitate the development of antibiotics. In this paper, the task of predicting properties of ARGs is modeled as a multi-task learning problem, and an effective subtask-aware representation learning-based framework is proposed accordingly. More specifically, property-specific expert networks and shared expert networks are utilized respectively to learn subtask-specific features for each subtask and shared features among different subtasks. In addition, a gating-controlled mechanism is employed to dynamically allocate weights to subtask-specific semantics and shared semantics obtained respectively from property-specific expert networks and shared expert networks, thus adjusting distinctive contributions of subtask-specific features and shared features to achieve optimal performance for each subtask simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted on publicly available data, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on the task of ARGs properties prediction.

A new individual arrives at the group by the Poisson process, while new links are established in the network through either uniform connection or preferential attachment. Moreover, an existing individual has a limited lifespan before leaving the network. We determine stationary topological properties of these networks, including their size and mean degree. To address the effect of the birth-death evolution, we further study the information dynamics in the proposed network model from the random drift and natural selection perspective, based on assumptions of total-stochastic and fitness-driven evolution, respectively. In simulations, we analyze the fixation probability of individual information and find that means of new connections affect the random drift process but do not affect the natural selection process.">

Under this modeling assumption, the latent variables represent the underlying manifold or essential features present in the neural data. When GPs are trained, the latent variable can be inferred from neural data to decode the labels with a high accuracy.

        <tr id="The attrition rate of drugs in clinical trials is generally quite high, with estimates suggesting that approximately 90% of drugs fail to make it through the process. The identification of unexpected toxicity issues during preclinical stages is a significant factor contributing to this high rate of failure. These issues can have a major impact on the success of a drug and must be carefully considered throughout the development process. These late-stage rejections or withdrawals of drug candidates significantly increase the costs associated with drug development, particularly when toxicity is detected during clinical trials or after market release. Understanding drug-biological target interactions is essential for evaluating compound toxicity and safety, as well as predicting therapeutic effects and potential off-target effects that could lead to toxicity. This will enable scientists to predict and assess the safety profiles of drug candidates more accurately. Evaluation of toxicity and safety is a critical aspect of drug development, and biomolecules, particularly proteins, play vital roles in complex biological networks and often serve as targets for various chemicals. Therefore, a better understanding of these interactions is crucial for the advancement of drug development. The development of computational methods for evaluating protein-ligand interactions and predicting toxicity is emerging as a promising approach that adheres to the 3Rs principles (replace, reduce, and refine) and has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this review, we present a thorough examination of the latest breakthroughs in drug toxicity prediction, highlighting the significance of drug-target binding affinity in anticipating and mitigating possible adverse effects. In doing so, we aim to contribute to the development of more effective and secure drugs.">

 For many ML models it is unclear how a prediction (output) is arrived at from the provided features (input). Critical systems cannot blindly trust the predictions of such "black box" models, but instead need additional reassurance via insight into the model's reasoning. A range of methods exist within the field of Explainable AI (XAI) to make the reasoning of black box ML models more understandable and transparent.
 The explanations provided by XAI methods may be evaluated in a number of (competing) ways. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between selected metrics for an XAI method called UnRAvEL, which is similar to the popular LIME approach. Our results show that by weighting the terms within the acquisition function used in UnRAvEL, different trade-offs can be achieved.">

In this dissertation, we explore high-dimensional problems related to physiological monitoring using latent variable models. First, we present a novel deep state-space model to generate electrical waveforms of the heart using optically obtained signals as inputs. This can bring about clinical diagnoses of heart disease via simple assessment through wearable devices. Second, we present a brain signal modeling scheme that combines the strengths of probabilistic graphical models and deep adversarial learning. The structured representations can provide interpretability and encode inductive biases to reduce the data complexity of neural oscillations. The efficacy of the learned representations is further studied in epilepsy seizure detection formulated as an unsupervised learning problem. Third, we propose a framework for the joint modeling of physiological measures and behavior. Existing methods to combine multiple sources of brain data provided are limited. Direct analysis of the relationship between different types of physiological measures usually does not involve behavioral data. Our method can identify the unique and shared contributions of brain regions to behavior and can be used to discover new functions of brain regions. The success of these innovative computational methods would allow the translation of biomarker findings across species and provide insight into neurocognitive analysis in numerous biological studies and clinical diagnoses, as well as emerging consumer applications.">

Deep-learning techniques, such as deep generative models, offer a promising avenue to expedite the discovery and optimization of AMPs. A remarkable example is the Feedback Generative Adversarial Network (FBGAN), a deep generative model that incorporates a classifier during its training phase. Our study aims to explore the impact of enhanced classifiers on the generative capabilities of FBGAN. To this end, we introduce two alternative classifiers for the FBGAN framework, both surpassing the accuracy of the original classifier. The first classifier utilizes the k-mers technique, while the second applies transfer learning from the large protein language model Evolutionary Scale Modeling 2 (ESM2). Integrating these classifiers into FBGAN not only yields notable performance enhancements compared to the original FBGAN but also enables the proposed generative models to achieve comparable or even superior performance to established methods such as AMPGAN and HydrAMP. This achievement underscores the effectiveness of leveraging advanced classifiers within the FBGAN framework, enhancing its computational robustness for AMP de novo design and making it comparable to existing literature.">

Recent studies such as the neural ordinary differential equation proposed a time-dependent neural network, which provides a neural network varying with respect to time. However, we claim that the architectural choice to build a time-dependent neural network significantly affects its time-awareness but still lacks sufficient validation in its current states. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the architecture of modern time-dependent neural networks. Here, we report a vulnerability of vanishing timestep embedding, which disables the time-awareness of a time-dependent neural network. Furthermore, we find that this vulnerability can also be observed in diffusion models because they employ a similar architecture that incorporates timestep embedding to discriminate between different timesteps during a diffusion process. Our analysis provides a detailed description of this phenomenon as well as several solutions to address the root cause. Through experiments on neural ordinary differential equations and diffusion models, we observed that ensuring alive time-awareness via proposed solutions boosted their performance, which implies that their current implementations lack sufficient time-dependency.">

        <tr id="Physiologically-based kinetic (PBK) models are widely used in pharmacology and toxicology for predicting the internal disposition of substances upon exposure, voluntarily or not. Due to their complexity, a large number of model parameters need to be estimated, either through in silico tools, in vitro experiments or by fitting the model to in vivo data. In the latter case, fitting complex structural models on in vivo data can result in overparameterisation and produce unrealistic parameter estimates. To address these issues, we propose a novel parameter grouping approach, which reduces the parametric space by co-estimating groups of parameters across compartments. Grouping of parameters is performed using genetic algorithms and is fully automated, based on a novel goodness-of-fit metric. To illustrate the practical application of the proposed methodology, two case studies were conducted. The first case study demonstrates the development of a new PBK model, while the second focuses on model refinement. In the first case study, a PBK model was developed to elucidate the biodistribution of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles in rats following intravenous injection. A variety of parameter estimation schemes were employed. Comparative analysis based on goodness-of-fit metrics demonstrated that the proposed methodology yields models that outperform standard estimation approaches, while utilising a reduced number of parameters. In the second case study, an existing PBK model for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in rats was extended to incorporate additional tissues, providing a more a comprehensive portrayal of PFOA biodistribution. Both models were validated through independent in vivo studies to ensure their reliability.">

While qualitative case-control predictions have received significant attention, less emphasis has been placed on predicting quantitative phenotypes. This emerging field holds great promise in revealing intricate connections between microbial communities and host health. However, the presence of heterogeneity in microbiome datasets poses a substantial challenge to the accuracy of predictions and undermines the reproducibility of models. To tackle this challenge, we investigated 22 normalization methods that aimed at removing heterogeneity across multiple datasets, conducted a comprehensive review of them, and evaluated their effectiveness in predicting quantitative phenotypes in three simulation scenarios and 31 real datasets. The results indicate that none of these methods demonstrate significant superiority in predicting quantitative phenotypes or attain a noteworthy reduction in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the predictions. Given the frequent occurrence of batch effects and the satisfactory performance of batch correction methods in predicting datasets affected by these effects, we strongly recommend utilizing batch correction methods as the initial step in predicting quantitative phenotypes. In summary, the performance of normalization methods in predicting metagenomic data remains a dynamic and ongoing research area. Our study contributes to this field by undertaking a comprehensive evaluation of diverse methods and offering valuable insights into their effectiveness in predicting quantitative phenotypes.">

In this paper, we investigate for the first time the relationship between the accuracy of neural networks for information of phases and the network configuration (that comprises the architecture and hyperparameters). We formulate the phase analysis as a regression task, address the question of generating data that reflects the different states of the physical system, and evaluate the performance of neural architecture search for this task. After obtaining the optimized architectures, we further implement smart data processing and analytics by means of neuron coverage metrics, assessing the capability of these metrics to estimate phase transitions.

A critical prerequisite for their notable success lies in the presence of a substantial number of training samples, which can be impractical in real-world applications due to high collection costs or associated risks. Consequently, various finetuning and regularization approaches have been proposed to transfer knowledge from existing pre-trained models to specific target domains with limited data. This paper introduces the Transfer Guided Diffusion Process (TGDP), a novel approach distinct from conventional finetuning and regularization methods. We prove that the optimal diffusion model for the target domain integrates pre-trained diffusion models on the source domain with additional guidance from a domain classifier. We further extend TGDP to a conditional version for modeling the joint distribution of data and its corresponding labels, together with two additional regularization terms to enhance the model performance. We validate the effectiveness of TGDP on Gaussian mixture simulations and on real electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets.">

However, tracking and forecasting such data streams poses a significant challenge to most methods, as they assume the underlying process and model does not change over time. In this paper, we apply one such data-driven method, the Koopman autoencoder (KAE), to high-dimensional oscillatory data to generate a low-dimensional latent space and model, where the system's dynamics appear linear. This allows one to accurately track and forecast systems where the underlying model may change over time. States and the model in the reduced order latent space can then be efficiently updated as new data becomes available, using data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), in a technique we call the KAE EnKF. We demonstrate that this approach is able to effectively track and forecast time-varying, nonlinear dynamical systems in synthetic examples. We then apply the KAE EnKF to a video of a physical pendulum, and achieve a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. By generating effective latent space reconstructions, we find that we are able to construct accurate short-term forecasts and efficient adaptations to externally forced changes to the pendulum's frequency.">

        <tr id="Analysis of factors that lead to the functionality of transcriptional activation domains remains a crucial and yet challenging task owing to the significant diversity in their sequences and their intrinsically disordered nature. Almost all existing methods that have aimed to predict activation domains have involved traditional machine learning approaches, such as logistic regression, that are unable to capture complex patterns in data or plain convolutional neural networks and have been limited in exploration of structural features. However, there is a tremendous potential in the inspection of the structural properties of activation domains, and an opportunity to investigate complex relationships between features of residues in the sequence. To address these, we have utilized the power of graph neural networks which can represent structural data in the form of nodes and edges, allowing nodes to exchange information among themselves. We have experimented with two kinds of graph formulations, one involving residues as nodes and the other assigning atoms to be the nodes. A logistic regression model was also developed to analyze feature importance. For all the models, several feature combinations were experimented with. The residue-level GNN model with amino acid type, residue position, acidic/basic/aromatic property and secondary structure feature combination gave the best performing model with accuracy, F1 score and AUROC of 97.9%, 71% and 97.1% respectively which outperformed other existing methods in the literature when applied on the dataset we used. Among the other structure-based features that were analyzed, the amphipathic property of helices also proved to be an important feature for classification. Logistic regression results showed that the most dominant feature that makes a sequence functional is the frequency of different types of amino acids in the sequence. Our results consistent have shown that functional sequences have more acidic and aromatic residues whereas basic residues are seen more in non-functional sequences.">

        <tr id="Polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes has become important in human genetics, especially in the context of precision medicine. Recently, Morgante et al. introduced mr.mash, a flexible and computationally efficient method that models multiple phenotypes jointly and leverages sharing of effects across such phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy. However, a drawback of mr.mash is that it requires individual-level data, which are often not publicly available. In this work, we introduce mr.mash-rss, an extension of the mr.mash model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel. By using summary data, we achieve the twin goal of increasing the applicability of the mr.mash model to data sets that are not publicly available and making it scalable to biobank-size data. Through simulations, we show that mr.mash-rss is competitive with, and often outperforms, current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in a variety of scenarios that differ in the pattern of effect sharing across phenotypes, the number of phenotypes, the number of causal variants, and the genomic heritability. We also present a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in UK Biobank, showing that mr.mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the data has smaller sample size. Author summary Polygenic prediction refers to the use of an individual’s genetic information (i.e., genotypes) to predict traits (i.e., phenotypes), which are often of medical relevance. It is known that some phenotypes are related and are affected by the same genotypes. When this is the case, it is possible to improve the accuracy of predictions by using methods that model multiple phenotypes jointly and account for shared effects. mr.mash is a recently developed multi-phenotype method that can learn which effects are shared and has been shown to improve prediction. However, mr.mash requires large data sets of genetic and phenotypic information collected at the individual level. Such data are often unavailable due to privacy concerns, or are difficult to work with due to the computational resources needed to analyze data of this size. Our work extends mr.mash to require only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies instead of individual-level data, which are usually publicly available. In addition, the computations using summary statistics do not depend on sample size, making the newly developed mr.mash-rss scalable to extremely large data sets. Using simulations and real data analysis, we show that our method is competitive with other methods for polygenic prediction.">

        <tr id="What Was the Problem or Question? 

With the availability of advanced genomic profiling methods, basket trials are more commonly used for the clinical assessment of treatments targeting multiple cancer types with a common biomarker. Basket trials study a primary intervention across a range of different patient subgroups (e.g., with specific cancer types) that share similar features (e.g., mutations or biomarkers), in which the effect of the primary intervention may be expected to differ. Heterogeneity among cancer types, limited sample sizes, a lack of comparators, and the use of surrogate end points pose challenges when considering the application to economic evaluations. Bayesian hierarchical models (BHMs) are well suited to account for the heterogeneity among cancer types while borrowing information across cancer types in basket trials. There is a need for clearer guidance about how these methods can be used in health technology assessment (HTA). 

What Did We Do? 

To better understand the role of BHMs in economic evaluations, an overview of basket trials and the current understanding of their use in economic evaluations was conducted, an illustration of how BHMs can inform economic evaluations was provided with a detailed example, and considerations for interpretating and appraising this information were listed. 

What Did We Find? 

BHMs offer an approach to use information from basket trials to inform economic evaluations; however, there are limitations to be aware of when using this information in economic evaluations and also when interpreting the results of the economic information. This document describes these limitations, and contains an appraisal list that was developed to highlight the implications. These are aspects that CADTH considers when assessing analyses based on BHMs. The field of BHMs is evolving, and advice in this document will need to be revisited as methods develop. 

What Does This Mean? 

As CADTH anticipates the increased need for appraisal of tumour-agnostic therapies, this document provides clarity around an important and useful set of methods for their evaluation, while also highlighting necessary areas for further research.

In these models, statistical inference is typically based on the absolute difference in the adjusted mean change (for categorical time) or the rate of change (for continuous time). Previously, we proposed a novel approach: modeling the percentage reduction in disease progression associated with the treatment relative to the placebo decline using proportional models. This concept of proportionality provides an innovative and flexible method for simultaneously modeling different cohorts, multivariate endpoints, and jointly modeling continuous and survival endpoints. Through simulated data, we demonstrate the implementation of these models using SAS procedures in both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.

        <tr id="Functional brain networks can change rapidly as a function of stimuli or cognitive shifts. Tracking dynamic functional connectivity is particularly challenging as it requires estimating the structure of the network at each moment as well as how it is shifting through time. In this paper, we describe a general modeling framework and a set of specific models that provides substantially increased statistical power for estimating rhythmic dynamic networks, based on the assumption that for a particular experiment or task, the network state at any moment is chosen from a discrete set of possible network modes. Each model is comprised of three components: (1) a set of latent switching states that represent transitions between the expression of each network mode; (2) a set of latent oscillators, each characterized by an estimated mean oscillation frequency and an instantaneous phase and amplitude at each time point; and (3) an observation model that relates the observed activity at each electrode to a linear combination of the latent oscillators. We develop an expectation-maximization procedure to estimate the network structure for each switching state and the probability of each state being expressed at each moment. We conduct a set of simulation studies to illustrate the application of these models and quantify their statistical power, even in the face of model misspecification.">

        <tr id="Empirical complex systems are widely assumed to be characterized not only by pairwise interactions, but also by higher-order (group) interactions that affect collective phenomena, from metabolic reactions to epidemics. Nevertheless, higher-order networks' superior descriptive power -- compared to classical pairwise networks -- comes with a much increased model complexity and computational cost. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to establish a quantitative method to determine when such a modeling framework is advantageous with respect to pairwise models, and to which extent it provides a parsimonious description of empirical systems. Here, we propose a principled method, based on information compression, to analyze the reducibility of higher-order networks to lower-order interactions, by identifying redundancies in diffusion processes while preserving the relevant functional information. The analysis of a broad spectrum of empirical systems shows that, although some networks contain non-compressible group interactions, others can be effectively approximated by lower-order interactions -- some technological and biological systems even just by pairwise interactions.

        <tr id="People with epilepsy have many difficulties as a result of this complicated brain condition, which is typified by frequent convulsions. Symptoms of these seizures include bizarre behaviors, odd sensations, and in extreme cases, loss of awareness. These seizures appear as episodes of aberrant electrical impulses in the central nervous system. Successful epilepsy management depends on early seizure detection and identification, which allows for appropriate intervention to minimize risks and improve patient outcomes. Two major reasons have contributed to the extraordinary advancements in the area of epilepsy investigations in the last few years: the explosive development of machine learning techniques and the decreasing cost of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) apparatus. The availability of low-cost EEG equipment has made it easier to gather information on brain activity, which has opened up new avenues for monitoring and analyzing episodes of epileptic seizures away from conventional medical settings. The abundance of data and the advancement of machine learning methods have created new opportunities for the early identification and forecasting of seizures. Machine learning algorithms can predict seizures based on EEG data, providing patients with epilepsy with more control and informed decision-making. This paper offers a current review of current methods for treating epileptic seizures. The feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms receive particular focus. The most popular EEG datasets and their accessibility are listed. The approaches that are examined range from those that use more established machine learning techniques, such as naive Bayes models, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), to those that take advantage of more recent deep learning techniques, like (Long-Short Term Memory, or LSTM), and deep Convolutional-Neural-Networks (CNN).">

        <tr id="Accurate prediction of complex traits is an important task in quantitative genetics that has become increasingly relevant for personalized medicine. Genotypes have traditionally been used for trait prediction using a variety of methods such as mixed models, Bayesian methods, penalized regressions, dimension reductions, and machine learning methods. Recent studies have shown that gene expression levels can produce higher prediction accuracy than genotypes. However, only a few prediction methods were used in these studies. Thus, a comprehensive assessment of methods is needed to fully evaluate the potential of gene expression as a predictor of complex trait phenotypes. Here, we used data from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to compare the ability of several existing statistical learning methods to predict starvation resistance from gene expression in the two sexes separately. The methods considered differ in assumptions about the distribution of gene effect sizes – ranging from models that assume that every gene affects the trait to more sparse models – and their ability to capture gene-gene interactions. We also used functional annotation (i.e., Gene Ontology (GO)) as an external source of biological information to inform prediction models. The results show that differences in prediction accuracy between methods exist, although they are generally not large. Methods performing variable selection gave higher accuracy in females while methods assuming a more polygenic architecture performed better in males. Incorporating GO annotations further improved prediction accuracy for a few GO terms of biological significance. Biological significance extended to the genes underlying highly predictive GO terms with different genes emerging between sexes. Notably, the Insulin-like Receptor (InR) was prevalent across methods and sexes. Our results confirmed the potential of transcriptomic prediction and highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate methods and strategies in order to achieve accurate predictions.">

In the context of biology, high-dimensional data may include transcriptomics, proteomics, and a variety of single-cell omics data. Most existing clustering algorithms operate directly in the high-dimensional space, and their performance may be negatively affected by the phenomenon known as the curse of dimensionality. Here, we show an alternative clustering approach that alleviates the curse by sequentially projecting high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional representation. We validated the effectiveness of our approach, named APP, across various biological data modalities, including flow and mass cytometry data, scRNA-seq, multiplex imaging data, and T-cell receptor repertoire data.

        <tr id="Introduction: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are characterized by their dynamism, meaning that the regulatory interactions which constitute these networks evolve with time. Identifying when changes in the GRN architecture occur can inform our understanding of fundamental biological processes, such as disease manifestation, development, and evolution. However, it is usually not possible to know a priori when a change in the network architecture will occur. Furthermore, an architectural shift may alter the underlying noise characteristics, such as the process noise covariance.Methods: We develop a fully Bayesian hierarchical model to address the following: a) sudden changes in the network architecture; b) unknown process noise covariance which may change along with the network structure; and c) unknown measurement noise covariance. We exploit the use of conjugate priors to develop an analytically tractable inference scheme using Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) with a local Gibbs sampler.Results: Our Bayesian learning algorithm effectively estimates time-varying gene expression levels and architectural model indicators under varying noise conditions. It accurately captures sudden changes in network architecture and accounts for time-evolving process and measurement noise characteristics. Our algorithm performs well even under high noise conditions. By incorporating conjugate priors, we achieve analytical tractability, enabling robust inference despite the inherent complexities of the system. Furthermore, our method outperforms the standard particle filter in all test scenarios.Discussion: The results underscore our method’s efficacy in capturing architectural changes in GRNs. Its ability to adapt to a range of time-evolving noise conditions emphasizes its practical relevance for real-world biological data, where noise presents a significant challenge. Overall, our method provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of GRNs and has the potential to advance our understanding of fundamental biological processes.">

We illustrate its use using time series from the standard Rossler system in the period doubling transitions and the transition to chaos. Moreover, we find that the standard deviation of LD can be more effective in highlighting the transition points. We also consider the variations in data when the parameter of the system is varying due to internal or intrinsic perturbations but at a time scale much slower than that of the dynamics. In this case also, the measure LD and its standard deviation correctly detect transition points in the underlying dynamics of the system. The computation of LD requires minimal computing resources and time, and works well with short data sets. Hence, we propose this measure as a tool to track transitions in dynamics from data, facilitating quicker and more effective analysis of large number of data sets.">

        <tr id="Large-scale prediction models (typically using tools from artificial intelligence, AI, or machine learning, ML) are increasingly ubiquitous across a variety of industries and scientific domains. Such methods are often paired with detailed data from sources such as electronic health records, wearable sensors, and omics data (high-throughput technology used to understand biology). Despite their utility, implementing AI and ML tools at the scale necessary to work with this data introduces two major challenges. First, it can cost tens of thousands of dollars to train a modern AI/ML model at scale. Second, once the model is trained, its predictions may become less relevant as patient and provider behavior change, and predictions made for one geographical area may be less accurate for another. These two challenges raise a fundamental question: how often should you refit the AI/ML model to optimally trade-off between cost and relevance? Our work provides a framework for making decisions about when to {\it refit} AI/ML models when the goal is to maintain valid statistical inference (e.g. estimating a treatment effect in a clinical trial). Drawing on portfolio optimization theory, we treat the decision of {\it recalibrating} versus {\it refitting} the model as a choice between ''investing'' in one of two ''assets.'' One asset, recalibrating the model based on another model, is quick and relatively inexpensive but bears uncertainty from sampling and the possibility that the other model is not relevant to current circumstances. The other asset, {\it refitting} the model, is costly but removes the irrelevance concern (though not the risk of sampling error). We explore the balancing act between these two potential investments in this paper.">

But, this initial belief is not known for many data sources. Here we introduce MELD-Adapt, designed to dynamically evaluate and infer the reliability of input data, thereby enhancing the accuracy of structure predictions. We demonstrate the utility of this method across different systems, particularly emphasizing its capability to correct initial assumptions and identify the correct fraction of data to produce reliable structural models. The approach is tested with two benchmark sets: the folding of twelve proteins with coarse physical insights and the binding of peptides with varying affinities to the Extrateterminal (ET) domain.

 Generalized epileptic attacks, which exhibit widespread disruption of brain activity, are characterized by recurrent, spontaneous, and synchronized bursts of neural activity that self-initiate and self-terminate through critical transitions. Here we utilize the general framework of explosive synchronization (ES) from complex systems science to study the role of network structure and resource dynamics in the generation and propagation of seizures. We show that a combination of resource constraint and adaptive coupling in a Kuramoto network oscillator model can reliably generate seizure-like synchronization activity across different network topologies, including a biologically derived mesoscale mouse brain network. The model, coupled with a novel algorithm for tracking seizure propagation, provides mechanistic insight into the dynamics of transition to the synchronized state and its dependence on resources; and identifies key brain areas that may be involved in the initiation and spatial propagation of the seizure. The model, though minimal, efficiently recapitulates several experimental and theoretical predictions from more complex models and makes novel experimentally testable predictions.">

        <tr id="This study introduces a systematic framework to compare the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) for fine-tuning across various cheminformatics tasks. Employing a uniform training methodology, we assessed three well-known models-RoBERTa, BART, and LLaMA-on their ability to predict molecular properties using the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) as a universal molecular representation format. Our comparative analysis involved pre-training 18 configurations of these models, with varying parameter sizes and dataset scales, followed by fine-tuning them on six benchmarking tasks from DeepChem. We maintained consistent training environments across models to ensure reliable comparisons. This approach allowed us to assess the influence of model type, size, and training dataset size on model performance. Specifically, we found that LLaMA-based models generally offered the lowest validation loss, suggesting their superior adaptability across tasks and scales. However, we observed that absolute validation loss is not a definitive indicator of model performance - contradicts previous research - at least for fine-tuning tasks: instead, model size plays a crucial role. Through rigorous replication and validation, involving multiple training and fine-tuning cycles, our study not only delineates the strengths and limitations of each model type but also provides a robust methodology for selecting the most suitable LLM for specific cheminformatics applications. This research underscores the importance of considering model architecture and dataset characteristics in deploying AI for molecular property prediction, paving the way for more informed and effective utilization of AI in drug discovery and related fields.">

        <tr id="Biology as a field has transformed since the time of its foundation from an organized enterprise cataloging the diversity of the natural world to a quantitatively rigorous science seeking to answer complex questions about the functions of organisms and their interactions with each other and their environments. As the mathematical rigor of biological analyses has improved, quantitative models have been developed to describe multi-mechanistic systems and to test complex hypotheses. However, applications of quantitative models have been uneven across fields, and many biologists lack the foundational training necessary to apply them in their research or to interpret their results to inform biological problem-solving efforts. This gap in scientific training has created a false dichotomy of "biologists'' and "modelers" that only exacerbates the barriers to working biologists seeking additional training in quantitative modeling. Here, we make the argument that all biologists are modelers, and are capable of using sophisticated quantitative modeling in their work. We highlight four benefits of conducting biological research within the framework of quantitative models, identify the potential producers and consumers of information produced by such models, and make recommendations for strategies to overcome barriers to their widespread implementation. Improved understanding of quantitative modeling could guide the producers of biological information to better apply biological measurements through analyses that evaluate mechanisms, and allow consumers of biological information to better judge the quality and applications of the information they receive. As our explanations of biological phenomena increase in complexity, so too must we embrace modeling as a foundational skill.">

Leveraging on the development of current large language models (LLM) in single cell genomics, we propose a causal inference based approach called CID to identify driver genes from scRNA-seq data. Through experiments on three different datasets, we show that CID can (1) identify biologically meaningful driver genes that have not been captured by current associative-analysis based methods, and (2) accurately predict the change directions of target genes if a driver gene is knocked out.">

        <tr id="Epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) identifies where models lack knowledge. Traditional UQ methods, often based on Bayesian neural networks, are not suitable for pre-trained non-Bayesian models. Our study addresses quantifying epistemic uncertainty for any pre-trained model, which does not need the original training data or model modifications and can ensure broad applicability regardless of network architectures or training techniques. Specifically, we propose a gradient-based approach to assess epistemic uncertainty, analyzing the gradients of outputs relative to model parameters, and thereby indicating necessary model adjustments to accurately represent the inputs. We first explore theoretical guarantees of gradient-based methods for epistemic UQ, questioning the view that this uncertainty is only calculable through differences between multiple models. We further improve gradient-driven UQ by using class-specific weights for integrating gradients and emphasizing distinct contributions from neural network layers. Additionally, we enhance UQ accuracy by combining gradient and perturbation methods to refine the gradients. We evaluate our approach on out-of-distribution detection, uncertainty calibration, and active learning, demonstrating its superiority over current state-of-the-art UQ methods for pre-trained models.">
