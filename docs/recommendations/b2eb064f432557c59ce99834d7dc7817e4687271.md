        <tr id="Many dynamical systems of interest are nonlinear, with examples in turbulence, epidemiology, neuroscience, and finance, making them difficult to control using linear approaches. Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful model-based optimization technique that enables the control of such nonlinear systems with constraints. However, modern systems often lack computationally tractable models, motivating the use of system identification techniques to learn accurate and efficient models for real-time control. In this tutorial article, we review emerging data-driven methods for model discovery and how they are used for nonlinear MPC. In particular, we focus on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm and show how it may be used with MPC on an infectious disease control example. We compare the performance against MPC based on a linear dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) model. Code is provided to run the tutorial examples and may be modified to extend this data-driven control framework to arbitrary nonlinear systems.">

While SINDy can be an appealing strategy for pursuing physics-based learning, our analysis highlights difficulties in dealing with unobserved states and non-smooth dynamics. Due to the ubiquity of these features in real systems in general, and control applications in particular, we complement our analysis with hands-on approaches to tackle these issues in order to exploit SINDy also in these challenging contexts.">

In contrast to neural-network-based methods, these methods are designed to obtain white-box analytical models. In this work, we incorporate the concept of SINDy and knowledge in the field of classical mechanics to identify interpretable and sparse expressions of total energy and the Lagrangian that shelters the hidden dynamics. Moreover, our method (hereafter referred as Lagrangian-SINDy) is developed to use knowledge of simple systems that form the system being analyzed to ensure the likelihood of correct results and to improve the learning pace. Lagrangian-SINDy is highly accurate in discovering interpretable dynamics via energy-related physical quantities. Its performance is validated with three popular multi-DOF nonlinear dynamical systems, namely the spherical pendulum, double pendulum and cart-pendulum system. Comparisons with other SINDy-based methods are made and Lagrangian-SINDy is found to provide the most compact analytical models.">

        <tr id="Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.">

        <tr id="Modern societies have an abundance of data yet good system models are rare. Unfortunately, many of the current system identification and machine learning techniques fail to generalize outside of the training set, producing models that violate basic physical laws. This work proposes a novel method for the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Side Information (SINDy-SI). SINDy-SI is an iterative method that uses Sum-of-Squares (SOS) programming to learn optimally fitted models while guaranteeing that the learned model satisfies side information, such as symmetries and physical laws. Guided by the principle of Occam's razor, that the simplest or most regularized best fitted model is typically the superior choice, during each iteration SINDy-SI prunes the basis functions associated with small coefficients, yielding a sparse dynamical model upon termination. Through several numerical experiments we will show how the combination of side information constraints and sparse polynomial representation cultivates dynamical models that obey known physical laws while displaying impressive generalized performance beyond the training set.">

        <tr id="Automated data-driven modeling, the process of directly discovering the governing equations of a system from data, is increasingly being used across the scientific community. PySINDy is a Python package that provides tools for applying the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach to data-driven model discovery. In this major update to PySINDy, we implement several advanced features that enable the discovery of more general differential equations from noisy and limited data. The library of candidate terms is extended for the identification of actuated systems, partial differential equations (PDEs), and implicit differential equations. Robust formulations, including the integral form of SINDy and ensembling techniques, are also implemented to improve performance for real-world data. Finally, we provide a range of new optimization algorithms, including several sparse regression techniques and algorithms to enforce and promote inequality constraints and stability. Together, these updates enable entirely new SINDy model discovery capabilities that have not been reported in the literature, such as constrained PDE identification and ensembling with different sparse regression optimizers.">

        <tr id="The vast majority of systems of practical interest are characterised by nonlinear dynamics. This renders the control and optimization of such systems a complex task due to their nonlinear behaviour. Additionally, standard methods such as linearizing around a fixed point may not be an effective strategy for many systems, thus requiring an alternative approach. For this reason, we propose a new deep learning framework to discover a transformation of a nonlinear dynamical system to an equivalent higher dimensional linear representation. We demonstrate that the resulting learned linear representation accurately captures the dynamics of the original system for a wider range of conditions than standard linearization. As a result of this, we show that the learned linear model can subsequently be used for the successful control of the original system. We demonstrate this by applying the proposed framework to two examples; one from the literature and a more complex example in the form of a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR).">
