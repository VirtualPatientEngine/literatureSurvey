        <tr id="We propose a heterogeneous graph mamba network (HGMN) as the first exploration in leveraging the selective state space models (SSSMs) for heterogeneous graph learning. Compared with the literature, our HGMN overcomes two major challenges: (i) capturing long-range dependencies among heterogeneous nodes and (ii) adapting SSSMs to heterogeneous graph data. Our key contribution is a general graph architecture that can solve heterogeneous nodes in real-world scenarios, followed an efficient flow. Methodologically, we introduce a two-level efficient tokenization approach that first captures long-range dependencies within identical node types, and subsequently across all node types. Empirically, we conduct comparisons between our framework and 19 state-of-the-art methods on the heterogeneous benchmarks. The extensive comparisons demonstrate that our framework outperforms other methods in both the accuracy and efficiency dimensions.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising potential in graph representation learning. The majority of GNNs define a local message-passing mechanism, propagating information over the graph by stacking multiple layers. These methods, however, are known to suffer from two major limitations: over-squashing and poor capturing of long-range dependencies. Recently, Graph Transformers (GTs) emerged as a powerful alternative to Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). GTs, however, have quadratic computational cost, lack inductive biases on graph structures, and rely on complex Positional/Structural Encodings (SE/PE). In this paper, we show that while Transformers, complex message-passing, and SE/PE are sufficient for good performance in practice, neither is necessary. Motivated by the recent success of State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba, we present Graph Mamba Networks (GMNs), a general framework for a new class of GNNs based on selective SSMs. We discuss and categorize the new challenges when adapting SSMs to graph-structured data, and present four required and one optional steps to design GMNs, where we choose (1) Neighborhood Tokenization, (2) Token Ordering, (3) Architecture of Bidirectional Selective SSM Encoder, (4) Local Encoding, and dispensable (5) PE and SE. We further provide theoretical justification for the power of GMNs. Experiments demonstrate that despite much less computational cost, GMNs attain an outstanding performance in long-range, small-scale, large-scale, and heterophilic benchmark datasets.">

        <tr id="Message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs), while excelling at capturing local relationships, often struggle with long-range dependencies on graphs. Conversely, graph transformers (GTs) enable information exchange between all nodes but oversimplify the graph structure by treating them as a set of fixed-length vectors. This work proposes a novel architecture, NeuralWalker, that overcomes the limitations of both methods by combining random walks with message passing. NeuralWalker achieves this by treating random walks as sequences, allowing for the application of recent advances in sequence models in order to capture long-range dependencies within these walks. Based on this concept, we propose a framework that offers (1) more expressive graph representations through random walk sequences, (2) the ability to utilize any sequence model for capturing long-range dependencies, and (3) the flexibility by integrating various GNN and GT architectures. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuralWalker achieves significant performance improvements on 19 graph and node benchmark datasets, notably outperforming existing methods by up to 13% on the PascalVoc-SP and COCO-SP datasets.

        <tr id="Machine learning on graphs has recently found extensive applications across domains. However, the commonly used Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) suffer from limited expressive power and struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Graph transformers offer a strong alternative due to their global attention mechanism, but they come with great computational overheads, especially for large graphs. In recent years, State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a compelling approach to replace full attention in transformers to model sequential data. It blends the strengths of RNNs and CNNs, offering a) efficient computation, b) the ability to capture long-range dependencies, and c) good generalization across sequences of various lengths. However, extending SSMs to graph-structured data presents unique challenges due to the lack of canonical node ordering in graphs. In this work, we propose Graph State Space Convolution (GSSC) as a principled extension of SSMs to graph-structured data. By leveraging global permutation-equivariant set aggregation and factorizable graph kernels that rely on relative node distances as the convolution kernels, GSSC preserves all three advantages of SSMs. We demonstrate the provably stronger expressiveness of GSSC than MPNNs in counting graph substructures and show its effectiveness across 10 real-world, widely used benchmark datasets, where GSSC achieves best results on 7 out of 10 datasets with all significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art baselines and second-best results on the other 3 datasets. Our findings highlight the potential of GSSC as a powerful and scalable model for graph machine learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/GSSC.">

        <tr id="Graph representation learning (GRL) is fundamental in multi-graph applications like molecular property prediction. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a popular method for GRL. However, existing GRL methods primarily focus on designing GNN models with enhanced expressiveness while overlooking the memory efficiency of algorithms during training. The memory inefficiency problem is caused by a contextual constraint imposed on node representations, which requires each node to be context-dependent on its input graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called context sketching (COS), for memory-efficient graph representation learning in multi-graph scenarios. We first formally define the contextual constraint based on the enclosed $\infty-$hop subgraphs of nodes. Subsequently, we propose to relax the original contextual constraint by requiring each node to be context-dependent on its enclosed $k-$hop subgraph $(k \ll \infty)$ which is a contextual sketch of the enclosed $\infty$-hop subgraph. Lastly, we prove that COS constructs an optimal solution to a memory-related objective associated with graph coarsening. Experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that COS can reduce the memory footprint of baselines by a large margin with almost no accuracy loss.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown impressive performance in graph representation learning, but they face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to their limited expressive power. To address this, Graph Transformers (GTs) were introduced, utilizing self-attention mechanism to effectively model pairwise node relationships. Despite their advantages, GTs suffer from quadratic complexity w.r.t. the number of nodes in the graph, hindering their applicability to large graphs. In this work, we present Graph-Enhanced Contextual Operator (GECO), a scalable and effective alternative to GTs that leverages neighborhood propagation and global convolutions to effectively capture local and global dependencies in quasilinear time. Our study on synthetic datasets reveals that GECO reaches 169x speedup on a graph with 2M nodes w.r.t. optimized attention. Further evaluations on diverse range of benchmarks showcase that GECO scales to large graphs where traditional GTs often face memory and time limitations. Notably, GECO consistently achieves comparable or superior quality compared to baselines, improving the SOTA up to 4.5%, and offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale graph learning.">

        <tr id="The Transformer architecture has achieved remarkable success in a number of domains including natural language processing and computer vision. However, when it comes to graph-structured data, transformers have not achieved competitive performance, especially on large graphs. In this paper, we identify the main deficiencies of current graph transformers:(1) Existing node sampling strategies in Graph Transformers are agnostic to the graph characteristics and the training process. (2) Most sampling strategies only focus on local neighbors and neglect the long-range dependencies in the graph. We conduct experimental investigations on synthetic datasets to show that existing sampling strategies are sub-optimal. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we formulate the optimization strategies of node sampling in Graph Transformer as an adversary bandit problem, where the rewards are related to the attention weights and can vary in the training procedure. Meanwhile, we propose a hierarchical attention scheme with graph coarsening to capture the long-range interactions while reducing computational complexity. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing graph transformers and popular GNNs.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based models have recently shown success in representation learning on graph-structured data beyond natural language processing and computer vision. However, the success is limited to small-scale graphs due to the drawbacks of full dot-product attention on graphs such as the quadratic complexity with respect to the number of nodes and message aggregation from enormous irrelevant nodes. To address these issues, we propose Deformable Graph Transformer (DGT) that performs sparse attention via dynamically sampled relevant nodes for efficiently handling large-scale graphs with a linear complexity in the number of nodes. Specifically, our framework first constructs multiple node sequences with various criteria to consider both structural and semantic proximity. Then, combining with our learnable Katz Positional Encodings, the sparse attention is applied to the node sequences for learning node representations with a significantly reduced computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 graph benchmark datasets with 2.5 - 449 times less computational cost compared to transformer-based graph models with full attention.">
