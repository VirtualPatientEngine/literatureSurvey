In this two part treatise, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct classes of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information. In this first part, we demonstrate how these networks can be used to infer solutions to partial differential equations, and obtain physics-informed surrogate models that are fully differentiable with respect to all input coordinates and free parameters.">

In this second part of our two-part treatise, we focus on the problem of data-driven discovery of partial differential equations.

The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using a wide range of benchmark problems in mathematical physics, including conservation laws, incompressible fluid flow, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.">

        <tr id="The process of transforming observed data into predictive mathematical models of the physical world has always been paramount in science and engineering. Although data is currently being collected at an ever-increasing pace, devising meaningful models out of such observations in an automated fashion still remains an open problem. In this work, we put forth a machine learning approach for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Specifically, we blend classical tools from numerical analysis, namely the multi-step time-stepping schemes, with powerful nonlinear function approximators, namely deep neural networks, to distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems involving the identification of complex, nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and we demonstrate how this allows us to accurately learn the dynamics, forecast future states, and identify basins of attraction. In particular, we study the Lorenz system, the fluid flow behind a cylinder, the Hopf bifurcation, and the Glycoltic oscillator model as an example of complicated nonlinear dynamics typical of biological systems.">

        <tr id="Mathematical models of biological reactions at the system-level lead to a set of ordinary differential equations with many unknown parameters that need to be inferred using relatively few experimental measurements. Having a reliable and robust algorithm for parameter inference and prediction of the hidden dynamics has been one of the core subjects in systems biology, and is the focus of this study. We have developed a new systems-biology-informed deep learning algorithm that incorporates the system of ordinary differential equations into the neural networks. Enforcing these equations effectively adds constraints to the optimization procedure that manifests itself as an imposed structure on the observational data. Using few scattered and noisy measurements, we are able to infer the dynamics of unobserved species, external forcing, and the unknown model parameters. We have successfully tested the algorithm for three different benchmark problems. Author summary The dynamics of systems biological processes are usually modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which introduce various unknown parameters that need to be estimated efficiently from noisy measurements of concentration for a few species only. In this work, we present a new “systems-informed neural network” to infer the dynamics of experimentally unobserved species as well as the unknown parameters in the system of equations. By incorporating the system of ODEs into the neural networks, we effectively add constraints to the optimization algorithm, which makes the method robust to noisy and sparse measurements.">

        <tr id="This study aims to provide insights into new areas of artificial intelligence approaches by examining how these techniques can be applied to predict behaviours for difficult physical processes represented by partial differential equations, particularly equations involving nonlinear dispersive behaviours. The current advection-dispersion-reaction equation is one of the key formulas used to depict natural processes with distinct characteristics. It is composed of a first-order advection component, a third-order dispersion term, and a nonlinear response term. Using the deep neural network approach and accounting for physics-informed neural network awareness, the problem has been elaborately discussed. Initial and boundary conditions are added as constraints when the neural networks are trained by minimizing the loss function. In comparison to the existing results, the approach has produced qualitatively correct kink and anti-kink solutions, with losses often remaining around 0.01%. It has also outperformed several traditional discretization-based methods.">

        <tr id="Deep learning with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has emerged as a highly popular and effective approach for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this paper, we first investigate the extrapolation capability of the PINN method for time-dependent PDEs. Taking advantage of this extrapolation property, we can generalize the training result obtained in the time subinterval to the large interval by adding a correction term to the network parameters of the subinterval. The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.">

Herein, we employ KANs to construct physics-informed machine learning models (PIKANs) and deep operator models (DeepOKANs) for solving differential equations for forward and inverse problems. In particular, we compare them with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks (DeepONets), which are based on the standard MLP representation. We find that although the original KANs based on the B-splines parameterization lack accuracy and efficiency, modified versions based on low-order orthogonal polynomials have comparable performance to PINNs and DeepONet although they still lack robustness as they may diverge for different random seeds or higher order orthogonal polynomials. We visualize their corresponding loss landscapes and analyze their learning dynamics using information bottleneck theory. Our study follows the FAIR principles so that other researchers can use our benchmarks to further advance this emerging topic.">

However, despite their significant success in various fields, it remains unclear in many aspects how to effectively train PINNs if the solutions of PDEs exhibit stiff behaviors or high frequencies. In this paper, we propose a new method for training PINNs using variable-scaling techniques. This method is simple and it can be applied to a wide range of problems including PDEs with rapidly-varying solutions. Throughout various numerical experiments, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for these problems and confirm that it can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of PINNs. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we will provide theoretical evidence for this phenomenon and show that our methods can indeed improve the performance of PINNs.">

        <tr id="The nonlinear sine-Gordon equation is a prevalent feature in numerous scientific and engineering problems. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), to investigate and explore the solution of the generalized non-linear sine-Gordon equation, encompassing Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. To incorporate physical information for the sine-Gordon equation, a multiobjective loss function has been defined consisting of the residual of governing partial differential equation (PDE), initial conditions, and various boundary conditions. Using multiple densely connected independent artificial neural networks (ANNs), called feedforward deep neural networks designed to handle partial differential equations, PINNs have been trained through automatic differentiation to minimize a loss function that incorporates the given PDE that governs the physical laws of phenomena. To illustrate the effectiveness, validity, and practical implications of our proposed approach, two computational examples from the nonlinear sine-Gordon are presented. We have developed a PINN algorithm and implemented it using Python software. Various experiments were conducted to determine an optimal neural architecture. The network training was employed by using the current state-of-the-art optimization methods in machine learning known as Adam and L-BFGS-B minimization techniques. Additionally, the solutions from the proposed method are compared with the established analytical solutions found in the literature. The findings show that the proposed method is a computational machine learning approach that is accurate and efficient for solving nonlinear sine-Gordon equations with a variety of boundary conditions as well as any complex nonlinear physical problems across multiple disciplines.">

        <tr id="We propose a new neural network based method for solving inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) by formulating the PDE inverse problem as a bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, we minimize the data loss with respect to the PDE parameters. At the lower level, we train a neural network to locally approximate the PDE solution operator in the neighborhood of a given set of PDE parameters, which enables an accurate approximation of the descent direction for the upper level optimization problem. The lower level loss function includes the L2 norms of both the residual and its derivative with respect to the PDE parameters. We apply gradient descent simultaneously on both the upper and lower level optimization problems, leading to an effective and fast algorithm. The method, which we refer to as BiLO (Bilevel Local Operator learning), is also able to efficiently infer unknown functions in the PDEs through the introduction of an auxiliary variable. Through extensive experiments over multiple PDE systems, we demonstrate that our method enforces strong PDE constraints, is robust to sparse and noisy data, and eliminates the need to balance the residual and the data loss, which is inherent to the soft PDE constraints in many existing methods.">

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

By combining the methods of training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), we develop a model which has the expressivity of DNNs with the fine-tuning ability of ELMs. We showcase the superiority of our proposed method by solving several BVPs and IBVPs which include linear and non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs) and coupled PDEs. The examples we consider include a stiff coupled ODE system where traditional numerical methods fail, a 3+1D non-linear PDE, Kovasznay flow and Taylor-Green vortex solutions to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and pure advection solution of 1+1 D compressible Euler equation. The Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) is used to exactly impose initial and boundary conditions (IBCs) of (I)BVPs on PINNs. We propose a modification to the TFC framework named Reduced TFC and show a significant improvement in the training and inference time of PINNs compared to IBCs imposed using TFC. Furthermore, Reduced TFC is shown to be able to generalize to more complex boundary geometries which is not possible with TFC. We also introduce a method of applying boundary conditions at infinity for BVPs and numerically solve the pure advection in 1+1 D Euler equations using these boundary conditions.">

        <tr id="Using neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) is gaining popularity as an alternative approach in the scientific computing community. Neural networks can integrate different types of information into the loss function. These include observation data, governing equations, and variational forms, etc. These loss functions can be broadly categorized into two types: observation data loss directly constrains and measures the model output, while other loss functions indirectly model the performance of the network, which can be classified as model loss. However, this alternative approach lacks a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms, including theoretical foundations and rigorous characterization of various phenomena. This work focuses on investigating how different loss functions impact the training of neural networks for solving PDEs. We discover a stable loss-jump phenomenon: when switching the loss function from the data loss to the model loss, which includes different orders of derivative information, the neural network solution significantly deviates from the exact solution immediately. Further experiments reveal that this phenomenon arises from the different frequency preferences of neural networks under different loss functions. We theoretically analyze the frequency preference of neural networks under model loss. This loss-jump phenomenon provides a valuable perspective for examining the underlying mechanisms of neural networks in solving PDEs.">

        <tr id="Physics informed neural networks have been gaining popularity due to their unique ability to incorporate physics laws into data-driven models, ensuring that the predictions are not only consistent with empirical data but also align with domain-specific knowledge in the form of physics equations. The integration of physics principles enables the method to require less data while maintaining the robustness of deep learning in modeling complex dynamical systems. However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach.

While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Domain decomposition provides an effective way to tackle the dilemma of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) which struggle to accurately and efficiently solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in the whole domain, but the lack of efficient tools for dealing with the interfaces between two adjacent sub-domains heavily hinders the training effects, even leads to the discontinuity of the learned solutions. In this paper, we propose a symmetry group based domain decomposition strategy to enhance the PINN for solving the forward and inverse problems of the PDEs possessing a Lie symmetry group. Specifically, for the forward problem, we first deploy the symmetry group to generate the dividing-lines having known solution information which can be adjusted flexibly and are used to divide the whole training domain into a finite number of non-overlapping sub-domains, then utilize the PINN and the symmetry-enhanced PINN methods to learn the solutions in each sub-domain and finally stitch them to the overall solution of PDEs. For the inverse problem, we first utilize the symmetry group acting on the data of the initial and boundary conditions to generate labeled data in the interior domain of PDEs and then find the undetermined parameters as well as the solution by only training the neural networks in a sub-domain. Consequently, the proposed method can predict high-accuracy solutions of PDEs which are failed by the vanilla PINN in the whole domain and the extended physics-informed neural network in the same sub-domains. Numerical results of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with a translation symmetry and the nonlinear viscous fluid equation with a scaling symmetry show that the accuracies of the learned solutions are improved largely.">

        <tr id="Parameter estimation is one of the central problems in computational modeling of biological systems. Typically, scientists must fully specify the mathematical structure of the model, often expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations, to estimate the parameters. This process poses significant challenges due to the necessity for a detailed understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating model parameters and assessing their identifiability in situations where only partial knowledge of the system structure is available. The partially known model is extended into a system of Hybrid Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, which captures the unknown portions of the system using neural networks. Integrating neural networks into the model structure introduces two primary challenges for parameter estimation: the need to globally explore the search space while employing gradient-based optimization, and the assessment of parameter identifiability, which may be hindered by the expressive nature of neural networks. To overcome the first issue, we treat biological parameters as hyperparameters in the extended model, exploring the parameter search space during hyperparameter tuning. The second issue is then addressed by an a posteriori analysis of parameter identifiability, computed by introducing a variant of a well-established approach for mechanistic models. These two components are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that is thoroughly described in the paper. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on test cases derived from three different benchmark models. These test cases have been designed to mimic real-world conditions, including the presence of noise in the training data and various levels of data availability for the system variables. Author summary Parameter estimation is a central challenge in modeling biological systems. Typically, scientists calibrate the parameters by aligning model predictions with measured data once the model structure is defined. Our paper introduces a workflow that leverages the integration between mechanistic modeling and machine learning to estimate model parameters when the model structure is not fully known. We focus mainly on analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters, which measures how confident we can be in the parameter estimates given the available experimental data and partial mechanistic understanding of the system. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach in various in silico scenarios. Our workflow represents a first step to adapting traditional methods used in fully mechanistic models to the scenario of hybrid modeling.">

Motivated from the ﬁnite volume schemes, the cell-average based neural network method is constructed based on the ﬁnite volume integrals of the original PDEs. Supervised training is designed to learn the solution average difference between two neighboring time steps. The training data set is generated by the cell average based on a single initial value of the given PDE. The training process employs multiple time levels of cell averages to maintain stability and control temporal accumulation errors. After being well trained based on appropriate meshes, this method can be utilized like a regular explicit ﬁnite volume method to evolve the solution under large time steps. Furthermore, it can be applied to solve different type of initial value problems without retraining the neural network. In order to validate the capability and robustness of the CANN method, we also utilize it to deal with the corrupted learning data which is generated from the Gaussian white noise. Several numerical examples of different types of Hunter-Saxton equations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, capability, and robustness of the proposed method.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a novel and popular approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, achieving stable training and obtaining correct results remain a challenge in many cases, often attributed to the ill-conditioning of PINNs. Nonetheless, further analysis is still lacking, severely limiting the progress and applications of PINNs in complex engineering problems. Drawing inspiration from the ill-conditioning analysis in traditional numerical methods, we establish a connection between the ill-conditioning of PINNs and the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian matrix of the PDE system. Specifically, for any given PDE system, we construct its controlled system. This controlled system allows for adjustment of the condition number of the Jacobian matrix while retaining the same solution as the original system. Our numerical findings suggest that the ill-conditioning observed in PINNs predominantly stems from the Jacobian matrix. As the condition number of the Jacobian matrix decreases, PINNs exhibit faster convergence rates and higher accuracy. Building upon this understanding and the natural extension of controlled systems, we present a general approach to mitigate the ill-conditioning of PINNs, leading to successful simulations of the three-dimensional flow around the M6 wing at a Reynolds number of 5,000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PINNs have been successful in simulating such complex systems, offering a promising new technique for addressing industrial complexity problems. Our findings also offer valuable insights guiding the future development of PINNs.">

        <tr id="We propose a novel finite element-based physics-informed operator learning framework that allows for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed framework employs a loss function inspired by the finite element method (FEM) with the implicit Euler time integration scheme. A transient thermal conduction problem is considered to benchmark the performance. The proposed operator learning framework takes a temperature field at the current time step as input and predicts a temperature field at the next time step. The Galerkin discretized weak formulation of the heat equation is employed to incorporate physics into the loss function, which is coined finite operator learning (FOL). Upon training, the networks successfully predict the temperature evolution over time for any initial temperature field at high accuracy compared to the FEM solution. The framework is also confirmed to be applicable to a heterogeneous thermal conductivity and arbitrary geometry. The advantages of FOL can be summarized as follows: First, the training is performed in an unsupervised manner, avoiding the need for a large data set prepared from costly simulations or experiments. Instead, random temperature patterns generated by the Gaussian random process and the Fourier series, combined with constant temperature fields, are used as training data to cover possible temperature cases. Second, shape functions and backward difference approximation are exploited for the domain discretization, resulting in a purely algebraic equation. This enhances training efficiency, as one avoids time-consuming automatic differentiation when optimizing weights and biases while accepting possible discretization errors. Finally, thanks to the interpolation power of FEM, any arbitrary geometry can be handled with FOL, which is crucial to addressing various engineering application scenarios.">

        <tr id="This study investigates the potential accuracy boundaries of physics-informed neural networks, contrasting their approach with previous similar works and traditional numerical methods. We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points. This study encourages the continued advancement of PINNs and associated optimization techniques for broader applications across various fields.">

        <tr id="In this study, we investigate the potential of fast-to-evaluate surrogate modeling techniques for developing a hybrid digital twin of a steel-reinforced concrete beam, serving as a representative example of a civil engineering structure. As surrogates, two distinct models are developed utilizing physics-informed neural networks, which integrate experimental data with given governing laws of physics. The experimental data (sensor data) is obtained from a previously conducted four-point bending test. The first surrogate model predicts strains at fixed locations along the center line of the beam for various time instances. This time-dependent surrogate model is inspired by the motion of a harmonic oscillator. For this study, we further compare the physics-based approach with a purely data-driven method, revealing the significance of physical laws for the extrapolation capabilities of models in scenarios with limited access to experimental data. Furthermore, we identify the natural frequency of the system by utilizing the physics-based model as an inverse solver. For the second surrogate model, we then focus on a fixed instance in time and combine the sensor data with the equations of linear elasticity to predict the strain distribution within the beam. This example reveals the importance of balancing different loss components through the selection of suitable loss weights.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces gradient-based adaptive neural networks to solve local fractional elliptic partial differential equations. The impact of physics-informed neural networks helps to approximate elliptic partial differential equations governed by the physical process. The proposed technique employs learning the behaviour of complex systems based on input-output data, and automatic differentiation ensures accurate computation of gradient. The method computes the singularity-embedded local fractional partial derivative model on a Hausdorff metric, which otherwise halts the computation by available approximating numerical methods. This is possible because the new network is capable of updating the weight associated with loss terms depending on the solution domain and requirement of solution behaviour. The semi-positive definite character of the neural tangent kernel achieves the convergence of gradient-based adaptive neural networks. The importance of hyperparameters, namely the number of neurons and the learning rate, is shown by considering a stationary anomalous diffusion-convection model on a rectangular domain. The proposed method showcases the network’s ability to approximate solutions of various local fractional elliptic partial differential equations with varying fractal parameters.">

This is combined with a physics-aware implicit solver that consists of a much coarser, discretized version of the original PDE, which provides the requisite information bottleneck for high-dimensional problems and enables generalization in out-of-distribution settings (e.g. different boundary conditions). We demonstrate its capability in the context of random heterogeneous materials where the input parameters represent the material microstructure.

We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation. Ample numerical experiments are presented based on the proposed algorithm to validate the effectiveness of this method and confirm aspects of the theoretical analyses.">

Inexpensive to evaluate, POD-DL-ROMs are also relatively fast to train, thanks to their limited complexity. However, POD-DL-ROMs account for the physical laws governing the problem at hand only through the training data, that are usually obtained through a full order model (FOM) relying on a high-fidelity discretization of the underlying equations. Moreover, the accuracy of POD-DL-ROMs strongly depends on the amount of available data. In this paper, we consider a major extension of POD-DL-ROMs by enforcing the fulfillment of the governing physical laws in the training process -- that is, by making them physics-informed -- to compensate for possible scarce and/or unavailable data and improve the overall reliability. To do that, we first complement POD-DL-ROMs with a trunk net architecture, endowing them with the ability to compute the problem's solution at every point in the spatial domain, and ultimately enabling a seamless computation of the physics-based loss by means of the strong continuous formulation. Then, we introduce an efficient training strategy that limits the notorious computational burden entailed by a physics-informed training phase. In particular, we take advantage of the few available data to develop a low-cost pre-training procedure; then, we fine-tune the architecture in order to further improve the prediction reliability. Accuracy and efficiency of the resulting pre-trained physics-informed DL-ROMs (PTPI-DL-ROMs) are then assessed on a set of test cases ranging from non-affinely parametrized advection-diffusion-reaction equations, to nonlinear problems like the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flows.">

        <tr id="The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

        <tr id="The $L^2$ gradient flow of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional leads to the Allen Cahn equation that is widely used for modeling phase separation. Machine learning methods for solving the Allen-Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives through automatic differentiation, and the large system size required by the space-time approach. To overcome these limitations, we propose a separable neural network-based approximation of the phase field in a minimizing movement scheme to solve the aforementioned gradient flow problem. At each time step, the separable neural network is used to approximate the phase field in space through a low-rank tensor decomposition thereby accelerating the derivative calculations. The minimizing movement scheme naturally allows for the use of Gauss quadrature technique to compute the functional. A `$tanh$' transformation is applied on the neural network-predicted phase field to strictly bounds the solutions within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, a theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that bounding the solution through this transformation is the key to effectively model sharp interfaces through separable neural network. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for phase separation problems and is an order of magnitude faster than the finite element method.">

        <tr id="Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, more data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalizable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than the neural network alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularization, penalizing biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularization not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularization reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses. Author summary Systems biology concerns the modelling and analysis of biological processes, by viewing these as interconnected systems. Modelling is typically done either using mechanistic differential equations that are derived from experiments and known biology, or using machine learning on large biological datasets. While mathematical modelling from biological experiments can provide useful insights with limited data, building and validating these models takes a long time and often requires highly invasive measurements in humans. Efforts to combine this classical technique with machine learning have resulted in a framework termed universal differential equations, where the model equations contain a neural network to describe unknown biological interactions. While these methods have shown success in numerous fields, applications in biology are more challenging due to limited data-availability, high data sparsity. In this work, we have introduced physiology-informed regularization to overcome these instabilities and to constrain the model to biologically plausible behavior. Our results show that by using physiology-informed regularization, we can accurately predict future unseen observations in a simulated example, with much more limited data than a similar model without regularization. Additionally, we show an application of this technique on human data, applying a neural network to learn the appearance of glucose in the blood plasma after a meal.">

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

        <tr id="Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.">

When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations.

Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework.

        <tr id="Given the existence of various forward and inverse problems in combustion studies and applications that necessitate distinct methods for resolution, a framework to solve them in a unified way is critically needed. A promising approach is the integration of machine learning methods with governing equations of combustion systems, which exhibits superior generality and few-shot learning ability compared to purely data-driven methods. In this work, the FlamePINN-1D framework is proposed to solve the forward and inverse problems of 1D laminar flames based on physics-informed neural networks. Three cases with increasing complexity have been tested: Case 1 are freely-propagating premixed (FPP) flames with simplified physical models, while Case 2 and Case 3 are FPP and counterflow premixed (CFP) flames with detailed models, respectively. For forward problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to solve the flame fields and infer the unknown eigenvalues (such as laminar flame speeds) under the constraints of governing equations and boundary conditions. For inverse problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to reconstruct the continuous fields and infer the unknown parameters (such as transport and chemical kinetics parameters) from noisy sparse observations of the flame. Our results strongly validate these capabilities of FlamePINN-1D across various flames and working conditions. Compared to traditional methods, FlamePINN-1D is differentiable and mesh-free, exhibits no discretization errors, and is easier to implement for inverse problems. The inverse problem results also indicate the possibility of optimizing chemical mechanisms from measurements of laboratory 1D flames. Furthermore, some proposed strategies, such as hard constraints and thin-layer normalization, are proven to be essential for the robust learning of FlamePINN-1D.

We explore using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling dynamic processes governed by differential-algebraic equation systems when process data is scarce and complete mechanistic knowledge is missing. In particular, we focus on estimating states for which neither direct observational data nor constitutive equations are available. For demonstration purposes, we study a continuously stirred tank reactor and a liquid-liquid separator. We find that PINNs can infer unmeasured states with reasonable accuracy, and they generalize better in low-data scenarios than purely data-driven models. We thus show that PINNs, similar to hybrid mechanistic/data-driven models, are capable of modeling processes when relatively few experimental data and only partially known mechanistic descriptions are available, and conclude that they constitute a promising avenue that warrants further investigation.">

Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting. Furthermore, our method achieves rapid adaptation to new CSTRs, BRs, and PFRs using only a few data samples from the designated tasks.

Their main benefit is better accuracy with fewer training points compared to standard neural networks. These attributes are particularly desirable in the field of computer-aided design, where there is often the need to replace computationally expensive, physics-based models with fast running approximations, known as surrogate models or meta-models. Since a surrogate emulates the original model accurately in near-real time, it yields a speed benefit that can be used to carry out orders of magnitude more function calls quickly. However, in the special case of gradient-enhanced methods, there is the additional value proposition that partial derivatives are accurate, which is a critical property for one important use-case: surrogate-based optimization. This work derives the complete theory and exemplifies its superiority over standard neural nets for surrogate-based optimization.">

        <tr id="We propose a generative flow-induced neural architecture search algorithm. The proposed approach devices simple feed-forward neural networks to learn stochastic policies to generate sequences of architecture hyperparameters such that the generated states are in proportion with the reward from the terminal state. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed search algorithm on the wavelet neural operator (WNO), where we learn a policy to generate a sequence of hyperparameters like wavelet basis and activation operators for wavelet integral blocks. While the trajectory of the generated wavelet basis and activation sequence is cast as flow, the policy is learned by minimizing the flow violation between each state in the trajectory and maximizing the reward from the terminal state. In the terminal state, we train WNO simultaneously to guide the search. We propose to use the exponent of the negative of the WNO loss on the validation dataset as the reward function. While the grid search-based neural architecture generation algorithms foresee every combination, the proposed framework generates the most probable sequence based on the positive reward from the terminal state, thereby reducing exploration time. Compared to reinforcement learning schemes, where complete episodic training is required to get the reward, the proposed algorithm generates the hyperparameter trajectory sequentially. Through four fluid mechanics-oriented problems, we illustrate that the learned policies can sample the best-performing architecture of the neural operator, thereby improving the performance of the vanilla wavelet neural operator.">

 A reliable means of hydrate plugging risk assessment in pipelines is critical to the modern practice of production in the hydrate management regime. Flow assurance engineers utilize computationally expensive multiphase flow simulations to characterize hydrate formation at desired conditions, however, there is no numerical method to assess the risk of a plug occurring from these results. Traditional machine learning models have shown reasonably accurate plugging risk classification and require just milliseconds to return an assessment. Despite this, there has been limited industry use due to concerns about the statistical nature of predictions and the sparsity of available training data.
 Deep neural networks (DNNs) are a purely data-driven machine learning model that require large quantities of labeled data to make accurate statistical predictions in their trained domain. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a variation of DNNs in which training additionally considers embedded domain physics, in the form of partial differential equations, to increase accuracy, lessen reliance on training data, and ground predictions. This work presents a PINN that has been trained to predict hydrate plugging risk. Training was directed by the mean squared error of the model's prediction against flowloop data and, critically, the residual of the hydrate intrinsic kinetics equation. The trained model showed improved accuracy over reference DNNs. A PINN of novel architecture embedded with the hydrate intrinsic kinetics equation was built in TensorFlow. Flowloop data from pilot-scale flowloops was used for the training and evaluation of the presented PINN. Performance was compared to two DNNs for plugging risk assessment. DNN1 was an earlier model presented at OTC 2019. DNN2 features identical architecture to the subject PINN but absent of the embedded physics. DNN1 was employed as a baseline for plugging risk assessment performance, whereas DNN2 was used to isolate the contribution of the embedded domain knowledge on inference accuracy. The PINN showed a plugging risk assessment accuracy of 98.7%, which is a meaningful improvement over the 95.0% accuracy offered by DNN1. Moreover, case studies show improved confidence in plug prediction. The effect of the embedded physics on model accuracy is quantified by a reduction in mean squared error of 13.3% in inference of hydrate volume fraction when compared to DNN2. These findings indicate that the increased accuracy is the result of the embedding of the hydrate intrinsic kinetics equation as well as the novel network architecture. Two additional PINNs were presented, further establish the superior behavior of PINNs in learning the solution to PDEs and under data-sparse conditions. This work provides a new approach for machine learning in hydrates by demonstrating a technique to accurately train neural networks through a combination of empirical data and domain knowledge. This line of research could ultimately lead to more informed quantification of hydrate plugging risk.">

        <tr id="Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.">

One advantage of the neural network method for PDEs lies in its automatic differentiation (AD), which necessitates only the sample points themselves, unlike traditional finite difference (FD) approximations that require nearby local points to compute derivatives. In this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of AD in training neural networks. The concept of truncated entropy is introduced to characterize the training property. Specifically, through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses conducted on random feature models and two-layer neural networks, we discover that the defined truncated entropy serves as a reliable metric for quantifying the residual loss of random feature models and the training speed of neural networks for both AD and FD methods. Our experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that, from a training perspective, AD outperforms FD in solving partial differential equations.">

However, PINNs are not well suited for solving PDEs with multiscale features, particularly suffering from slow convergence and poor accuracy. To address this limitation of PINNs, this article proposes physics-informed cell representations for resolving multiscale Poisson problems using a model architecture consisting of multilevel multiresolution grids coupled with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The grid parameters (i.e., the level-dependent feature vectors) and the MLP parameters (i.e., the weights and biases) are determined using gradient-descent based optimization. The variational (weak) form based loss function accelerates computation by allowing the linear interpolation of feature vectors within grid cells. This cell-based MLP model also facilitates the use of a decoupled training scheme for Dirichlet boundary conditions and a parameter-sharing scheme for periodic boundary conditions, delivering superior accuracy compared to conventional PINNs. Furthermore, the numerical examples highlight improved speed and accuracy in solving PDEs with nonlinear or high-frequency boundary conditions and provide insights into hyperparameter selection. In essence, by cell-based MLP model along with the parallel tiny-cuda-nn library, our implementation improves convergence speed and numerical accuracy.">

Traditional numerical methods for these problems are mesh-based, thus struggling with the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising solution due to their universal approximation, generalization ability, and mesh-free training. In principle, Monte Carlo fractional PINN (MC-fPINN) estimates fractional derivatives using Monte Carlo methods and thus could lift CoD. However, this may cause significant variance and errors, hence affecting convergence; in addition, MC-fPINN is sensitive to hyperparameters. In general, numerical methods and specifically PINNs for tempered fractional PDEs are under-developed. Herein, we extend MC-fPINN to tempered fractional PDEs to address these issues, resulting in the Monte Carlo tempered fractional PINN (MC-tfPINN). To reduce possible high variance and errors from Monte Carlo sampling, we replace the one-dimensional (1D) Monte Carlo with 1D Gaussian quadrature, applicable to both MC-fPINN and MC-tfPINN. We validate our methods on various forward and inverse problems of fractional and tempered fractional PDEs, scaling up to 100,000 dimensions.

It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

        <tr id="Multiscale problems are widely observed across diverse domains in physics and engineering. Translating these problems into numerical simulations and solving them using numerical schemes, e.g. the finite element method, is costly due to the demand of solving initial boundary-value problems at multiple scales. On the other hand, multiscale finite element computations are commended for their ability to integrate micro-structural properties into macroscopic computational analyses using homogenization techniques. Recently, neural operator-based surrogate models have shown trustworthy performance for solving a wide range of partial differential equations. In this work, we propose a hybrid method in which we utilize deep operator networks for surrogate modeling of the microscale physics. This allows us to embed the constitutive relations of the microscale into the model architecture and to predict microscale strains and stresses based on the prescribed macroscale strain inputs. Furthermore, numerical homogenization is carried out to obtain the macroscale quantities of interest. We apply the proposed approach to quasi-static problems of solid mechanics. The results demonstrate that our constitutive relations-aware DeepONet can yield accurate solutions even when being confronted with a restricted dataset during model development.">

        <tr id="Modeling the dynamics of flexible objects has become an emerging topic in the community as these objects become more present in many applications, e.g., soft robotics. Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

End-to-end machine learning approaches to inverse problems typically require constructing sophisticated estimators to achieve the desired accuracy, largely because they need to learn the complex underlying physical model.

We dub this process surrogate training embedded in physics (STEP) and illustrate that it generalizes well and is robust against overfitting and significant noise in the data. We demonstrate how STEP can be applied to perform dynamic kernel deconvolution to analyse resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra and show that surprisingly simple estimator architectures suffice to extract the relevant physical information.">

        <tr id="Partial differential equations (PDEs) with multiple scales or those defined over sufficiently large domains arise in various areas of science and engineering and often present problems when approximating the solutions numerically. Machine learning techniques are a relatively recent method for solving PDEs. Despite the increasing number of machine learning strategies developed to approximate PDEs, many remain focused on relatively small domains. When scaling the equations, a large domain is naturally obtained, especially when the solution exhibits multiscale characteristics. This study examines two-scale equations whose solution structures exhibit distinct characteristics: highly localized in some regions and significantly flat in others. These two regions must be adequately addressed over a large domain to approximate the solution more accurately. We focus on the vanishing gradient problem given by the diminishing gradient zone of the activation function over large domains and propose a stratified sampling algorithm to address this problem. We compare the uniform random classical sampling method over the entire domain and the proposed stratified sampling method. The numerical results confirm that the proposed method yields more accurate and consistent solutions than classical methods.">

        <tr id="Abstract Numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) are instrumental for material structural design where extensive data screening is needed. However, traditional numerical methods demand significant computational resources, highlighting the need for innovative optimization algorithms to streamline design exploration. Direct gradient-based optimization algorithms, while effective, rely on design initialization and require complex, problem-specific sensitivity derivations. The advent of machine learning offers a promising alternative to handling large parameter spaces. To further mitigate data dependency, researchers have developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to learn directly from PDEs. However, the intrinsic continuity requirement of PINNs restricts their application in structural mechanics problems, especially for composite materials. Our work addresses this discontinuity issue by substituting the PDE residual with a weak formulation in the physics-informed training process. The proposed approach is exemplified in modeling digital materials, which are mathematical representations of complex composites that possess extreme structural discontinuity. This article also introduces an interactive process that integrates physics-informed loss with design objectives, eliminating the need for pretrained surrogate models or analytical sensitivity derivations. The results demonstrate that our approach can preserve the physical accuracy in data-free material surrogate modeling but also accelerates the direct optimization process without model pretraining.">

This fact, along with the requirement of substantial computational resources, poses a barrier to achieving high numerical accuracy. Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs.

Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

Recently, the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been introduced as one of the most promising tools to solve systems of differential equations guided by some physically grounded constraints. In the quantum realm, such approach paves the way to a novel approach to solve the Schroedinger equation for non-integrable systems. By following an unsupervised learning approach, we apply the PINNs to the anharmonic oscillator in which an interaction term proportional to the fourth power of the position coordinate is present. We compute the eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions while varying the weight of the quartic interaction. We bridge our solutions to the regime where both the perturbative and the strong coupling theory work, including the pure quartic oscillator. We investigate systems with real and imaginary frequency, laying the foundation for novel numerical methods to tackle problems emerging in quantum field theory.">

However, since they make use of neural networks, they provide only a point estimate of differential equation parameters, as well as the solution at any given point, without any measure of uncertainty. Ensemble and Bayesian methods have been previously applied to quantify the uncertainty of PINNs, but these methods may require making strong assumptions on the data-generating process, and can be computationally expensive.

However, despite their user-friendly interface and broad applicability, PINNs encounter challenges in accurately resolving PDEs, especially when dealing with singular cases that may lead to unsatisfactory local minima. To address these challenges and improve solution accuracy, we propose an innovative approach called Annealed Adaptive Importance Sampling (AAIS) for computing the discretized PDE residuals of the cost functions, inspired by the Expectation Maximization algorithm used in finite mixtures to mimic target density. Our objective is to approximate discretized PDE residuals by strategically sampling additional points in regions with elevated residuals, thus enhancing the effectiveness and accuracy of PINNs. Implemented together with a straightforward resampling strategy within PINNs, our AAIS algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency across a range of tested PDEs, even with limited training datasets. Moreover, our proposed AAIS-PINN method shows promising capabilities in solving high-dimensional singular PDEs. The adaptive sampling framework introduced here can be integrated into various PINN frameworks.">

Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained popularity in scientific computing in recent years. However, they often fail to achieve the same level of accuracy as classical methods in solving differential equations. In this paper, we identify two sources of this issue in the case of Cauchy problems: the use of $L^2$ residuals as objective functions and the approximation gap of neural networks. We show that minimizing the sum of $L^2$ residual and initial condition error is not sufficient to guarantee the true solution, as this loss function does not capture the underlying dynamics. Additionally, neural networks are not capable of capturing singularities in the solutions due to the non-compactness of their image sets. This, in turn, influences the existence of global minima and the regularity of the network. We demonstrate that when the global minimum does not exist, machine precision becomes the predominant source of achievable error in practice. We also present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.">

However, in reality, many practical applications still depend on well-established but non-automatic-differentiable legacy codes, which prevents practitioners from applying the state-of-the-art research to their own problems. To resolve this problem, we propose a non-intrusive methodology with a novel gradient estimation technique to combine machine learning and legacy numerical codes without any modification.

        <tr id="Machine learning is increasingly employed in engineering, with one of its primary applications being the construction of surrogate models to replace computationally expensive physical models for analysis and design, especially control co-design which integrates physical and control system design. In cases where generating labels for training through physical models is computationally intensive, label-free machine learning offers a viable alternative. However, surrogate models built from label-free machine learning typically have prediction errors, which can be characterized and quantified through epistemic uncertainty, representing model-form uncertainty. Moreover, when these surrogate models are used in optimization design for real-world applications, inherent random variables introduce aleatory uncertainty. This study introduces a robust design optimization method that addresses the intertwined epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. By optimizing both the average product performance and reducing uncertainty stemming from the coupled uncertainty, the method achieves improved robustness. A four-bar linkage mechanism design serves as a demonstration of this approach. The surrogate model for the design is constructed using label-free neural network, accommodating a system of physical equations. The error of the surrogate model is assessed through Gaussian Process regression, using existing training points and derivatives of the physical equations at these points. The design of the four-bar linkage aims to minimize both its average motion error and the variability of the error attributed to coupled uncertainty.">

In this paper we take some prototypical examples and, under standard hypothesis concerning the neural network convergence, we show that the optimal time sampling follows a truncated exponential distribution. In particular we explain when the time sampling is best to be uniform and when it should not be.

These systems rely on maximum likelihood point estimates of their parameters, precluding them from expressing model uncertainty. This may result in overconfident predictions and it prevents the use of deep learning models for sequential decision making. This thesis develops scalable methods to equip neural networks with model uncertainty. In particular, we leverage the linearised Laplace approximation to equip pre-trained neural networks with the uncertainty estimates provided by their tangent linear models. This turns the problem of Bayesian inference in neural networks into one of Bayesian inference in conjugate Gaussian-linear models. Alas, the cost of this remains cubic in either the number of network parameters or in the number of observations times output dimensions. By assumption, neither are tractable. We address this intractability by using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) -- the workhorse algorithm of deep learning -- to perform posterior sampling in linear models and their convex duals: Gaussian processes. With this, we turn back to linearised neural networks, finding the linearised Laplace approximation to present a number of incompatibilities with modern deep learning practices -- namely, stochastic optimisation, early stopping and normalisation layers -- when used for hyperparameter learning. We resolve these and construct a sample-based EM algorithm for scalable hyperparameter learning with linearised neural networks. We apply the above methods to perform linearised neural network inference with ResNet-50 (25M parameters) trained on Imagenet (1.2M observations and 1000 output dimensions). Additionally, we apply our methods to estimate uncertainty for 3d tomographic reconstructions obtained with the deep image prior network.">

Recent research focuses on predicting the value of these unknown parameters using available contextual features, aiming to decrease decision regret by adopting end-to-end learning approaches. However, these approaches disregard prediction uncertainty and therefore make the mathematical solver susceptible to provide erroneous decisions in case of low-confidence predictions. We propose a novel framework that models prediction uncertainty with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and propagates this uncertainty into the mathematical solver with a Stochastic Programming technique. The differentiable nature of BNNs and differentiable mathematical solvers allow for two different learning approaches: In the Decoupled learning approach, we update the BNN weights to increase the quality of the predictions' distribution of the OP parameters, while in the Combined learning approach, we update the weights aiming to directly minimize the expected OP's cost function in a stochastic end-to-end fashion. We do an extensive evaluation using synthetic data with various noise properties and a real dataset, showing that decisions regret are generally lower (better) with both proposed methods.">

For example, classical fully-connected feed-forward NNs fail to approximate continuous functions whose gradient is discontinuous when employing strong formulations like in Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). In this article, we propose the use of regularity-conforming neural networks, where a priori information on the regularity of solutions to PDEs can be employed to construct proper architectures. We illustrate the potential of such architectures via a two-dimensional (2D) transmission problem, where the solution may admit discontinuities in the gradient across interfaces, as well as power-like singularities at certain points. In particular, we formulate the weak transmission problem in a PINNs-like strong formulation with interface and continuity conditions. Such architectures are partially explainable; discontinuities are explicitly described, allowing the introduction of novel terms into the loss function. We demonstrate via several model problems in one and two dimensions the advantages of using regularity-conforming architectures in contrast to classical architectures.

        <tr id="Reduced order modeling lowers the computational cost of solving PDEs by learning a low-order spatial representation from data and dynamically evolving these representations using manifold projections of the governing equations. While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems, e.g. in climate and engineering sciences, often necessitates solving partial differential equations. Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing outputs and gradients of deep models to satisfy target equations. Due to the limitation of numerical computation, PINNs are conventionally optimized on finite selected points. However, since PDEs are usually defined on continuous domains, solely optimizing models on scattered points may be insufficient to obtain an accurate solution for the whole domain. To mitigate this inherent deficiency of the default scatter-point optimization, this paper proposes and theoretically studies a new training paradigm as region optimization. Concretely, we propose to extend the optimization process of PINNs from isolated points to their continuous neighborhood regions, which can theoretically decrease the generalization error, especially for hidden high-order constraints of PDEs. A practical training algorithm, Region Optimized PINN (RoPINN), is seamlessly derived from this new paradigm, which is implemented by a straightforward but effective Monte Carlo sampling method. By calibrating the sampling process into trust regions, RoPINN finely balances sampling efficiency and generalization error. Experimentally, RoPINN consistently boosts the performance of diverse PINNs on a wide range of PDEs without extra backpropagation or gradient calculation.">

        <tr id="Transport phenomena (e.g., fluid flows) are governed by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) describing mass, momentum, and energy conservation, and are ubiquitous in many engineering applications. However, deep learning architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the simulation of these PDEs. This paper clearly articulates and then solves this incompatibility. The local-dependency of generic transport PDEs implies that it only involves local information to predict the physical properties at a location in the next time step. However, the deep learning architecture will inevitably increase the scope of information to make such predictions as the number of layers increases, which can cause sluggish convergence and compromise generalizability. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a distributed data scoping method with linear time complexity to strictly limit the scope of information to predict the local properties. The numerical experiments over multiple physics show that our data scoping method significantly accelerates training convergence and improves the generalizability of benchmark models on large-scale engineering simulations. Specifically, over the geometries not included in the training data for heat transferring simulation, it can increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 21.7 \% and that of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by 38.5 \% on average.">

Therefore, relying on the existing theory leads to unjustified design choices and suboptimal performance. In this work, we analyze the residual loss by studying its characteristics at critical points to find the conditions that result in effective training of PINNs. Specifically, we first show that under certain conditions, the residual loss of PINNs can be globally minimized by a wide neural network. Furthermore, our analysis also reveals that an activation function with well-behaved high-order derivatives plays a crucial role in minimizing the residual loss. In particular, to solve a $k$-th order PDE, the $k$-th derivative of the activation function should be bijective. The established theory paves the way for designing and choosing effective activation functions for PINNs and explains why periodic activations have shown promising performance in certain cases. Finally, we verify our findings by conducting a set of experiments on several PDEs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nimahsn/pinns_tf2.">

The issue gets worse when the changing parameters are unobserved, i.e., their value or influence is not directly measurable when collecting data. We introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a framework that encodes said unobserved parameters in a latent context vector as input to a vector field. NCFs leverage differentiability of the vector field with respect to the parameters, along with first-order Taylor expansion to allow any context vector to influence trajectories from other parameters. We validate our method and compare it to established Multi-Task and Meta-Learning alternatives, showing competitive performance in mean squared error for in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluation on the Lotka-Volterra, Glycolytic Oscillator, and Gray-Scott problems.

In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks.

While computational fluid dynamics is precise, it is computationally impractical for real-time control. Lumped thermal models divide the room into cells and explicitly model inter-cell air-mixing. However, solving the coupled differential equations is still computationally challenging. Data-driven methods like long-short term memory may handle non-linear thermal dynamics but face limitations in observability, adherence to physical constraints, and generalization. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) impose physical constraints even while learning from data. However, PINNs still lack the scalability required for effective control in large open-plan offices, primarily due to air-mixing interactions Our approach, PhyGICS, combines graph neural networks with physics-informed learning (PI-GNN) to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we model the thermodynamic interactions as edges between nodes that represent cells. Further, the modeling approach allows explicit modeling of wall and window surface temperatures that are commonly ignored. PhyGICS, utilizing PI-GNN as a state-estimator, employs a receding-horizon approach for optimal HVAC control. We adapt PI-GNNs for building HVAC control by incorporating a time-resetting strategy to handle time-dependent ambient conditions and therefore set-points. Evaluations in a simulated environment with real-world data show PhyGICS outperforms a regular PINN model and other baseline control strategies on: 1) thermal model accuracy; 2) computation time; 3) energy consumption; and 4) user comfort.">

This method's integration of parametric space information significantly reduces the need for training data to effectively predict high-fidelity solutions from low-fidelity ones. In this study, we examine a two-dimensional steady-state heat transfer analysis within a highly heterogeneous materials microstructure. The heat conductivity coefficients for two different materials are condensed from a 101 x 101 grid to smaller grids. We then solve the boundary value problem on the coarsest grid using a pre-trained physics-informed neural operator network known as Finite Operator Learning (FOL). The resulting low-fidelity solution is subsequently upscaled back to a 101 x 101 grid using a newly designed enhanced autoencoder. The novelty of the developed enhanced autoencoder lies in the concatenation of heat conductivity maps of different resolutions to the decoder segment in distinct steps. Hence the developed algorithm is named microstructure-embedded autoencoder (MEA). We compare the MEA outcomes with those from finite element methods, the standard U-Net, and various other upscaling techniques, including interpolation functions and feedforward neural networks (FFNN). Our analysis shows that MEA outperforms these methods in terms of computational efficiency and error on test cases. As a result, the MEA serves as a potential supplement to neural operator networks, effectively upscaling low-fidelity solutions to high fidelity while preserving critical details often lost in traditional upscaling methods, particularly at sharp interfaces like those seen with interpolation.">

By (i) constraining the state transition on fancy space to be linear and (ii) learning a Gaussian inverse observation operator $q(h_t|o_t)$, posteriors always remain Gaussian for DBF. Quite distinctively, the structured design of posteriors provides an analytic formula for the recursive computation of posteriors without accumulating Monte-Carlo sampling errors over time steps. DBF seeks the Gaussian inverse observation operators $q(h_t|o_t)$ and other latent SSM parameters (e.g., dynamics matrix) by maximizing the evidence lower bound.

Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the function of two-body interactions, thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.">

In this manuscript, several PBR methods are implemented to enforce stress equilibrium on a network predicting the stress fields of a high elastic contrast composite. Models with PBR enforced the equilibrium constraint more accurately than a model without PBR, and the stress equilibrium converged more quickly. More importantly, it was observed that independently fine-tuning each implementation resulted in more accurate models. More specifically, each loss formulation and dataset required different learning rates and loss weights for the best performance. This result has important implications on assessing the relative effectiveness of different DL models and highlights important considerations when making a comparison between DL methods.">

        <tr id="This article explores operator learning models that can deduce solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) on arbitrary domains without requiring retraining. We introduce two innovative models rooted in boundary integral equations (BIEs): the Boundary Integral Type Deep Operator Network (BI-DeepONet) and the Boundary Integral Trigonometric Deep Operator Neural Network (BI-TDONet), which are crafted to address PDEs across diverse domains. Once fully trained, these BIE-based models adeptly predict the solutions of PDEs in any domain without the need for additional training. BI-TDONet notably enhances its performance by employing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of bounded linear operators, allowing for the efficient distribution of input functions across its modules. Furthermore, to tackle the issue of function sampling values that do not effectively capture oscillatory and impulse signal characteristics, trigonometric coefficients are utilized as both inputs and outputs in BI-TDONet. Our numerical experiments robustly support and confirm the efficacy of this theoretical framework.">

        <tr id="Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve the PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a specific set of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation or a finite set of coefficients. This bottleneck limits the generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major advantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a Transformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable generalizability and scalability.">

Traditional methods, such as finite difference and finite elements, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Neural network based algorithms are meshless methods, which can avoid the curse of dimensionality. However, at low temperature, when directly solving a stationary Fokker-Planck equation with more than two metastable states in the generalized potential landscape, the small eigenvalue introduces numerical difficulties due to a large condition number. To overcome these problems, we introduce the IGANN method, which uses a penalty of negative input gradient annealing during the training.

        <tr id="Physics-guided neural networks (PGNN) is an effective tool that combines the benefits of data-driven modeling with the interpretability and generalization of underlying physical information. However, for a classical PGNN, the penalization of the physics-guided part is at the output level, which leads to a conservative result as systems with highly similar state-transition functions, i.e. only slight differences in parameters, can have significantly different time-series outputs. Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.">

This class of problems is not only of great academic interest, but is also the basis for describing various environmental and industrial problems. In this way, ConDiff shortens the gap with real-world problems while remaining fully synthetic and easy to use. ConDiff consists of a diverse set of diffusion equations with coefficients covering a wide range of contrast levels and heterogeneity with a measurable complexity metric for clearer comparison between different coefficient functions. We baseline ConDiff on standard deep learning models in the field of scientific machine learning.

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained considerable interest in diverse engineering domains thanks to their capacity to integrate physical laws into deep learning models. Recently, geometry-aware PINN-based approaches that employ the strong form of underlying physical system equations have been developed with the aim of integrating geometric information into PINNs. Despite ongoing research, the assessment of PINNs in problems with various geometries remains an active area of investigation. In this work, we introduce a novel physics-informed framework named the Geometry-Aware Deep Energy Method (GADEM) for solving structural mechanics problems on different geometries. As the weak form of the physical system equation (or the energy-based approach) has demonstrated clear advantages compared to the strong form for solving solid mechanics problems, GADEM employs the weak form and aims to infer the solution on multiple shapes of geometries. Integrating a geometry-aware framework into an energy-based method results in an effective physics-informed deep learning model in terms of accuracy and computational cost. Different ways to represent the geometric information and to encode the geometric latent vectors are investigated in this work. We introduce a loss function of GADEM which is minimized based on the potential energy of all considered geometries. An adaptive learning method is also employed for the sampling of collocation points to enhance the performance of GADEM. We present some applications of GADEM to solve solid mechanics problems, including a loading simulation of a toy tire involving contact mechanics and large deformation hyperelasticity. The numerical results of this work demonstrate the remarkable capability of GADEM to infer the solution on various and new shapes of geometries using only one trained model.">

In this study, we rigorously develop a partial differential equation (PDE) that unravels the frequency dynamics of the error for a 2-layer NN in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime. Furthermore, using this insight, we explicitly demonstrate how an appropriate choice of distributions for the initialization weights can eliminate or control the frequency bias. We focus our study on the Fourier Features model, an NN where the first layer has sine and cosine activation functions, with frequencies sampled from a prescribed distribution. In this setup, we experimentally validate our theoretical results and compare the NN dynamics to the solution of the PDE using the finite element method. Finally, we empirically show that the same principle extends to multi-layer NNs.">

The HINTS method combines neural operators (NOs) with standard iterative solvers, e.g. Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel (GS), to achieve better performance by leveraging the spectral bias of neural networks. In HINTS, some iterations of the conventional iterative method are replaced by inferences of the pre-trained NO. In this work, we employ HINTS to solve the scattering problem for both 2D and 3D problems, where the standard iterative solver fails. We consider square and triangular scatterers of various sizes in 2D, and a cube and a model submarine in 3D. We explore and illustrate the extrapolation capability of HINTS in handling diverse geometries of the scatterer, which is achieved by training the NO on non-scattering scenarios and then deploying it in HINTS to solve scattering problems. The accurate results demonstrate that the NO in HINTS method remains effective without retraining or fine-tuning it whenever a new scatterer is given. Taken together, our results highlight the adaptability and versatility of the extended HINTS methodology in addressing diverse scattering problems.">

While moment propagation can ameliorate the computational costs of BNN inference, it can be difficult or impossible for networks with arbitrary nonlinearities, thereby restricting the possible set of network layers permitted with such a scheme. In this work, we demonstrate a simple yet effective approach for propagating statistical moments through arbitrary nonlinearities with only 3 deterministic samples, enabling few-sample variational inference of BNNs without restricting the set of network layers used.

In contrast, data-driven machine learning offers a promising avenue to estimate practical acoustic propagation by learning from dataset. However, collecting such a high-quality, noise-free, and dense dataset remains challenging. Under the practical hurdle posed by the above approaches, the emergence of physics-informed neural network (PINN) presents an alternative to integrate physics and data but with limited representation capacity. In this work, a framework, termed spatial domain decomposition-based physics-informed neural networks (SPINNs), is proposed to enhance the representation capacity in spatially dependent oceanic scenarios and effectively learn from incomplete and biased prior physics and noisy dataset. Experiments demonstrate SPINNs' advantages over PINN in practical acoustic propagation estimation. The learning capacity of SPINNs toward physics and dataset during training is further analyzed.

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

        <tr id="Superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) wires and rods possess unique deformation and energy dissipation capabilities. For the assessment of their stress response, commonly cyclic tensile tests are conducted. An important but subtle parameter in this procedure is the martensite evolution. In scenarios where conducting thermal experiments is impractical, inverse modeling from cyclic tests serves as a viable alternative. However, employing constitutive models in this process presents distinct challenges, such as parameter identification and calibration, or numerical stability issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven method based on a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) to estimate the martensite evolution. Constraint with a stress equation, the network requires only strain–stress data for training and provides stress responses in addition to the martensite evolution. From the training data, the network learns to consider the effects included in the response. The DeepONet can be coupled with experiments to provide online estimates from noisy sensor-based strain inputs, while remaining numerically stable. Moreover, this approach avoids the need for separate parameter identification or calibration. This paper details this method and evaluates its performance through experiments conducted on superelastic SMA wires. Furthermore, as an alternative approach, training using a constitutive model is provided.">

These underlying constraints are obtained following linear stability for dynamical systems. We further extend this approach for learning nonlinear differential operators by determining linear stability constraints for linearized equations around an equilibrium point. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated for both linear and nonlinear partial differential equations such as 1-D scalar advection-diffusion equation, 1-D Burgers equation and 2-D advection equation. The results indicated that solutions to constrained regression problems with linear stability constraints provide accurate and linearly stable sparse differential operators.">

Purpose
In this study, the authors propose a novel digital twinning approach specifically designed for controlling transient thermal systems. The purpose of this study is to harness the combined power of deep learning (DL) and physics-based methods (PBM) to create an active virtual replica of the physical system.


Design/methodology/approach
To achieve this goal, we introduce a deep neural network (DNN) as the digital twin and a Finite Element (FE) model as the physical system. This integrated approach is used to address the challenges of controlling an unsteady heat transfer problem with an integrated feedback loop.


Findings
The results of our study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed digital twinning approach in regulating the maximum temperature within the system under varying and unsteady heat flux conditions. The DNN, trained on stationary data, plays a crucial role in determining the heat transfer coefficients necessary to maintain temperatures below a defined threshold value, such as the material’s melting point. The system is successfully controlled in 1D, 2D and 3D case studies. However, careful evaluations should be conducted if such a training approach, based on steady-state data, is applied to completely different transient heat transfer problems.


Originality/value
The present work represents one of the first examples of a comprehensive digital twinning approach to transient thermal systems, driven by data. One of the noteworthy features of this approach is its robustness. Adopting a training based on dimensionless data, the approach can seamlessly accommodate changes in thermal capacity and thermal conductivity without the need for retraining.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

In previous work, we combined genetic algorithm (GA) and machine learning to present a data-driven method for discovering a wave equation. Although it managed to utilize the data to discover the two-dimensional (x,z) acoustic constant-density wave equation u_tt=v^2(u_xx+u_zz) (subscripts of the wavefield, u, are second derivatives in time and space) in a homogeneous medium, it did not provide the complete equation form, where the velocity term is represented by a coefficient rather than directly given by v^2. In this work, we redesign the framework, encoding both velocity information and candidate functional terms simultaneously. Thus, we use GA to simultaneously evolve the candidate functional and coefficient terms in the library. Also, we consider here the physics rationality and interpretability in the randomly generated potential wave equations, by ensuring that both-hand sides of the equation maintain balance in their physical units. We demonstrate this redesigned framework using the acoustic wave equation as an example, showing its ability to produce physically reasonable expressions of wave equations from noisy and sparsely observed data in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media. Also, we demonstrate that our method can effectively discover wave equations from a more realistic observation scenario.">

        <tr id="High-quality passive devices are becoming increasingly important for the development of mobile devices and telecommunications, but obtaining such devices through simulation and analysis of electromagnetic (EM) behavior is time-consuming. To address this challenge, artificial neural network (ANN) models have emerged as an effective tool for modeling EM behavior, with NeuroTF being a representative example. However, these models are limited by the specific form of the transfer function, leading to discontinuity issues and high sensitivities. Moreover, previous methods have overlooked the physical relationship between distributed parameters, resulting in unacceptable numeric errors in the conversion results. To overcome these limitations, we propose two different neural network architectures: DeepOTF and ComplexTF. DeepOTF is a data-driven deep operator network for automatically learning feasible transfer functions for different geometric parameters. ComplexTF utilizes complex-valued neural networks to fit feasible transfer functions for different geometric parameters in the complex domain while maintaining causality and passivity. Our approach also employs an Equations-constraint Learning scheme to ensure the strict consistency of predictions and a dynamic weighting strategy to balance optimization objectives. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework shows superior performance than baseline methods, achieving up to 1700 × higher accuracy.">

In this work, we present the first learning-based environment for boundary control of PDEs. In our benchmark, we introduce three foundational PDE problems - a 1D transport PDE, a 1D reaction-diffusion PDE, and a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE - whose solvers are bundled in an user-friendly reinforcement learning gym. With this gym, we then present the first set of model-free, reinforcement learning algorithms for solving this series of benchmark problems, achieving stability, although at a higher cost compared to model-based PDE backstepping.

        <tr id="Machine learning techniques are being used as an alternative to traditional numerical discretization methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to fluid flow. Whilst numerical methods are higher fidelity, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning methods on the other hand are lower fidelity but provide significant speed-ups. The emergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in fluid dynamics has allowed scientists to directly use PDEs for evaluating loss functions in an unsupervised manner. The downfall of this approach is that the differential form of systems is invalid at regions of shock inherent in hyperbolic PDEs such as the compressible Euler equations. To circumvent this problem we propose a modification to PDE-based PINN losses by using a finite volume-based loss function that incorporates the flux of Godunov-type methods. These Godunov-type methods are also known as approximate Riemann solvers and evaluate intercell fluxes in an entropy-satisfying manner, yielding more physically accurate shocks. Our approach increases fidelity compared to using regularized PDE-based PINN losses, as tested on the 2D Riemann problem.">

        <tr id="A critical issue in approximating solutions of ordinary differential equations using neural networks is the exact satisfaction of the boundary or initial conditions. For this purpose, neural forms have been introduced, i.e., functional expressions that depend on neural networks which, by design, satisfy the prescribed conditions exactly. Expanding upon prior progress, the present work contributes in three distinct aspects. First, it presents a novel formalism for crafting optimized neural forms. Second, it outlines a method for establishing an upper bound on the absolute deviation from the exact solution. Third, it introduces a technique for converting problems with Neumann or Robin conditions into equivalent problems with parametric Dirichlet conditions. The proposed optimized neural forms were numerically tested on a set of diverse problems, encompassing first-order and second-order ordinary differential equations, as well as first-order systems. Stiff and delay differential equations were also considered. The obtained solutions were compared against solutions obtained via Runge-Kutta methods and exact solutions wherever available. The reported results and analysis verify that in addition to the exact satisfaction of the boundary or initial conditions, optimized neural forms provide closed-form solutions of superior interpolation capability and controllable overall accuracy.">

        <tr id="We develop a novel deep learning technique, termed Deep Orthogonal Decomposition (DOD), for dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of parameter dependent partial differential equations. The approach consists in the construction of a deep neural network model that approximates the solution manifold through a continuously adaptive local basis. In contrast to global methods, such as Principal Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), the adaptivity allows the DOD to overcome the Kolmogorov barrier, making the approach applicable to a wide spectrum of parametric problems. Furthermore, due to its hybrid linear-nonlinear nature, the DOD can accommodate both intrusive and nonintrusive techniques, providing highly interpretable latent representations and tighter control on error propagation. For this reason, the proposed approach stands out as a valuable alternative to other nonlinear techniques, such as deep autoencoders. The methodology is discussed both theoretically and practically, evaluating its performances on problems featuring nonlinear PDEs, singularities, and parametrized geometries.">

        <tr id="We propose an algorithm capable of identifying and eliminating irrelevant layers of a neural network during the early stages of training. In contrast to weight or filter-level pruning, layer pruning reduces the harder to parallelize sequential computation of a neural network. We employ a structure using residual connections around nonlinear network sections that allow the flow of information through the network once a nonlinear section is pruned. Our approach is based on variational inference principles using Gaussian scale mixture priors on the neural network weights and allows for substantial cost savings during both training and inference. More specifically, the variational posterior distribution of scalar Bernoulli random variables multiplying a layer weight matrix of its nonlinear sections is learned, similarly to adaptive layer-wise dropout. To overcome challenges of concurrent learning and pruning such as premature pruning and lack of robustness with respect to weight initialization or the size of the starting network, we adopt the"flattening"hyper-prior on the prior parameters. We prove that, as a result of its usage, the solutions of the resulting optimization problem describe deterministic networks with parameters of the posterior distribution at either 0 or 1. We formulate a projected SGD algorithm and prove its convergence to such a solution using stochastic approximation results. In particular, we prove conditions that lead to a layer's weights converging to zero and derive practical pruning conditions from the theoretical results. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and common LeNet, VGG16 and ResNet architectures. The simulations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of the-art performance for layer pruning at reduced computational cost in distinction to competing methods due to the concurrent training and pruning.">

        <tr id="This work addresses data-driven inverse optimization (IO), where the goal is to estimate unknown parameters in an optimization model from observed decisions that can be assumed to be optimal or near-optimal solutions to the optimization problem. The IO problem is commonly formulated as a large-scale bilevel program that is notoriously difficult to solve. Deviating from traditional exact solution methods, we propose a derivative-free optimization approach based on Bayesian optimization, which we call BO4IO, to solve general IO problems. We treat the IO loss function as a black box and approximate it with a Gaussian process model. Using the predicted posterior function, an acquisition function is minimized at each iteration to query new candidate solutions and sequentially converge to the optimal parameter estimates. The main advantages of using Bayesian optimization for IO are two-fold: (i) it circumvents the need of complex reformulations of the bilevel program or specialized algorithms and can hence enable computational tractability even when the underlying optimization problem is nonconvex or involves discrete variables, and (ii) it allows approximations of the profile likelihood, which provide uncertainty quantification on the IO parameter estimates. We apply the proposed method to three computational case studies, covering different classes of forward optimization problems ranging from convex nonlinear to nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programs. Our extensive computational results demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of BO4IO to accurately estimate unknown model parameters from small and noisy datasets. In addition, the proposed profile likelihood analysis has proven to be effective in providing good approximations of the confidence intervals on the parameter estimates and assessing the identifiability of the unknown parameters.">

In this work, we specifically focus on employing a three-layer tanh neural network within the framework of the deep Ritz method(DRM) to solve second-order elliptic equations with three different types of boundary conditions. We perform projected gradient descent(PDG) to train the three-layer network and we establish its global convergence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a comprehensive error analysis of using overparameterized networks to solve PDE problems, as our analysis simultaneously includes estimates for approximation error, generalization error, and optimization error. We present error bound in terms of the sample size $n$ and our work provides guidance on how to set the network depth, width, step size, and number of iterations for the projected gradient descent algorithm. Importantly, our assumptions in this work are classical and we do not require any additional assumptions on the solution of the equation.

        <tr id="Utilizing machine learning to address partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges due to the diversity of spatial domains and their corresponding state configurations, which complicates the task of encompassing all potential scenarios through data-driven methodologies alone. Moreover, there are legitimate concerns regarding the generalization and reliability of such approaches, as they often overlook inherent physical constraints. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel machine-learning architecture that is highly generalizable and adheres to conservation laws and physical symmetries, thereby ensuring greater reliability. The foundation of this architecture is graph neural networks (GNNs), which are adept at accommodating a variety of shapes and forms. Additionally, we explore the parallels between GNNs and traditional numerical solvers, facilitating a seamless integration of conservative principles and symmetries into machine learning models. Our findings from experiments demonstrate that the model's inclusion of physical laws significantly enhances its generalizability, i.e., no significant accuracy degradation for unseen spatial domains while other models degrade.

Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

In terms of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) based additive manufacturing (AM), a DT can predict the current and future states of the melt pool and the resulting defects corresponding to the input laser parameters, evolve itself by assimilating in-situ sensor data, and optimize the laser parameters to mitigate defect formation. In this paper, we present a deep neural operator enabled computational framework of the DT for closed-loop feedback control of the L-PBF process. This is accomplished by building a high-fidelity computational model to accurately represent the melt pool states, an efficient surrogate model to approximate the melt pool solution field, followed by an physics-based procedure to extract information from the computed melt pool simulation that can further be correlated to the defect quantities of interest (e.g., surface roughness). In particular, we leverage the data generated from the high-fidelity physics-based model and train a series of Fourier neural operator (FNO) based ML models to effectively learn the relation between the input laser parameters and the corresponding full temperature field of the melt pool. Subsequently, a set of physics-informed variables such as the melt pool dimensions and the peak temperature can be extracted to compute the resulting defects. An optimization algorithm is then exercised to control laser input and minimize defects. On the other hand, the constructed DT can also evolve with the physical twin via offline finetuning and online material calibration. Finally, a probabilistic framework is adopted for uncertainty quantification. The developed DT is envisioned to guide the AM process and facilitate high-quality manufacturing.">

Within the realm of turbulent flow simulation, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is widely considered to be the most reliable approach, but it is prohibitively expensive for long-term simulation at fine spatial scales. Given the pressing need for efficient simulation, there is an increasing interest in building machine learning models for turbulence, either by reconstructing DNS from alternative low-fidelity simulations or by predicting DNS based on the patterns learned from historical data. However, standard machine learning techniques remain limited in capturing complex spatio-temporal characteristics of turbulent flows, resulting in limited performance and generalizability. This paper presents a novel physics-enhanced neural operator (PENO) that incorporates physical knowledge of partial differential equations (PDEs) to accurately model flow dynamics. The model is further refined by a self-augmentation mechanism to reduce the accumulated error in long-term simulations. The proposed method is evaluated through its performance on two distinct sets of 3D turbulent flow data, showcasing the model's capability to reconstruct high-resolution DNS data, maintain the inherent physical properties of flow transport, and generate flow simulations across various resolutions. Additionally, experimental results on multiple 2D vorticity flow series, generated by different PDEs, highlight the transferability and generalizability of the proposed method. This confirms its applicability to a wide range of real-world scenarios in which extensive simulations are needed under diverse settings.">

Nonetheless, difficulties in generalization and limitations in accuracy have hindered their broader utility and applicability. In this work, we use a paired autoencoder framework as a likelihood-free estimator for inverse problems. We show that the use of such an architecture allows us to construct a solution efficiently and to overcome some known open problems when using likelihood-free estimators.

        <tr id="Predicting cancer dynamics under treatment is challenging due to high inter-patient heterogeneity, lack of predictive biomarkers, and sparse and noisy longitudinal data. Mathematical models can summarize cancer dynamics by a few interpretable parameters per patient. Machine learning methods can then be trained to predict the model parameters from baseline covariates, but do not account for uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Instead, hierarchical Bayesian modeling can model the relationship between baseline covariates to longitudinal measurements via mechanistic parameters while accounting for uncertainty in every part of the model. The mapping from baseline covariates to model parameters can be modeled in several ways. A linear mapping simplifies inference but fails to capture nonlinear covariate effects and scale poorly for interaction modeling when the number of covariates is large. In contrast, Bayesian neural networks can potentially discover interactions between covariates automatically, but at a substantial cost in computational complexity. In this work, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of subpopulation dynamics that uses baseline covariate information to predict cancer dynamics under treatment, inspired by cancer dynamics in multiple myeloma (MM), where serum M protein is a well-known proxy of tumor burden. As a working example, we apply the model to a simulated dataset and compare its ability to predict M protein trajectories to a model with linear covariate effects. Our results show that the Bayesian neural network covariate effect model predicts cancer dynamics more accurately than a linear covariate effect model when covariate interactions are present. The framework can also be applied to other types of cancer or other time series prediction problems that can be described with a parametric model.">

        <tr id="This work introduces neural Green's operators (NGOs), a novel neural operator network architecture that learns the solution operator for a parametric family of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our construction of NGOs is derived directly from the Green's formulation of such a solution operator. Similar to deep operator networks (DeepONets) and variationally mimetic operator networks (VarMiONs), NGOs constitutes an expansion of the solution to the PDE in terms of basis functions, that is returned from a sub-network, contracted with coefficients, that are returned from another sub-network. However, in accordance with the Green's formulation, NGOs accept weighted averages of the input functions, rather than sampled values thereof, as is the case in DeepONets and VarMiONs. Application of NGOs to canonical linear parametric PDEs shows that, while they remain competitive with DeepONets, VarMiONs and Fourier neural operators when testing on data that lie within the training distribution, they robustly generalize when testing on finer-scale data generated outside of the training distribution. Furthermore, we show that the explicit representation of the Green's function that is returned by NGOs enables the construction of effective preconditioners for numerical solvers for PDEs.">

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) of different types, including fractional PDEs (fPDES) [29]. Herein, we propose a new general (quasi) Monte Carlo PINN for solving fPDEs on irregular domains. Specifically, instead of approximating fractional derivatives by Monte Carlo approximations of integrals as was done previously in [31], we use a more general Monte Carlo approximation method to solve different fPDEs, which is valid for fractional differentiation under any definition. Moreover, based on the ensemble probability density function, the generated nodes are all located in denser regions near the target point where we perform the differentiation. This has an unexpected connection with known finite difference methods on non-equidistant or nested grids, and hence our method inherits their advantages. At the same time, the generated nodes exhibit a block-like dense distribution, leading to a good computational efficiency of this approach. We present the framework for using this algorithm and apply it to several examples. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC-PINNs in dealing with irregular domain problems and show a higher computational efficiency compared to the original fPINN method. We also include comparisons with the Monte Carlo fPINN [31]. Finally, we use examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in dealing with fuzzy boundary location problems, and then use the method to solve the coupled 3D fractional Bloch-Torrey equation defined in the ventricular domain of the human brain, and compare the results with classical numerical methods.">

In this regard, we address the role of the condition number of the finite element matrix in the convergence of the method. Secondly, we derive an explicit error estimate for the self-adjoint case. For this, we investigate some regularity properties of the solution in certain function classes for a neural network approximation, verifying the sufficient condition for the solution to have the desired regularity.

The new dynamical system is called parameterized WGF (PWGF), and it is defined on the finite-dimensional parameter space equipped with a pullback Wasserstein metric. Our numerical scheme can approximate the solutions of WGFs for general energy functionals effectively, without requiring spatial discretization or nonconvex optimization procedures, thus avoiding some limitations of classical numerical methods and more recent deep-learning-based approaches. A comprehensive analysis of the approximation errors measured by Wasserstein distance is also provided in this work.

        <tr id="There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.">

        <tr id="Recently, Conditional Neural Fields (NeFs) have emerged as a powerful modelling paradigm for PDEs, by learning solutions as flows in the latent space of the Conditional NeF. Although benefiting from favourable properties of NeFs such as grid-agnosticity and space-time-continuous dynamics modelling, this approach limits the ability to impose known constraints of the PDE on the solutions -- e.g. symmetries or boundary conditions -- in favour of modelling flexibility. Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.">

Inspired by second order B-spline wavelets, we incorporate a set of simple constraints to the ReLU neurons in each layer of a deep neural network (DNN) to remedy the spectral bias. This in turn enables its use for various INR tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, one can learn state-of-the-art INRs based on a DNN composed of only ReLU neurons. Next, by leveraging recent theoretical works which characterize the kinds of functions ReLU neural networks learn, we provide a way to quantify the regularity of the learned function. This offers a principled approach to selecting the hyperparameters in INR architectures. We substantiate our claims through experiments in signal representation, super resolution, and computed tomography, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of our method.

        <tr id="The primal approach to physics-informed learning is a residual minimization. We argue that residual is, at best, an indirect measure of the error of approximate solution and propose to train with error majorant instead. Since error majorant provides a direct upper bound on error, one can reliably estimate how close PiNN is to the exact solution and stop the optimization process when the desired accuracy is reached. We call loss function associated with error majorant $\textbf{Astral}$: neur$\textbf{A}$l a po$\textbf{ST}$erio$\textbf{RI}$ function$\textbf{A}$l Loss. To compare Astral and residual loss functions, we illustrate how error majorants can be derived for various PDEs and conduct experiments with diffusion equations (including anisotropic and in the L-shaped domain), convection-diffusion equation, temporal discretization of Maxwell's equation, and magnetostatics problem. The results indicate that Astral loss is competitive to the residual loss, typically leading to faster convergence and lower error (e.g., for Maxwell's equations, we observe an order of magnitude better relative error and training time). We also report that the error estimate obtained with Astral loss is usually tight enough to be informative, e.g., for a highly anisotropic equation, on average, Astral overestimates error by a factor of $1.5$, and for convection-diffusion by a factor of $1.7$.">

Understanding feature learning from a theoretical viewpoint is an emerging field with many open questions. In this work we capture finite-width effects with a systematic theory of network kernels in deep non-linear neural networks. We show that the Bayesian prior of the network can be written in closed form as a superposition of Gaussian processes, whose kernels are distributed with a variance that depends inversely on the network width N . A large deviation approach, which is exact in the proportional limit for the number of data points $P = \alpha N \rightarrow \infty$, yields a pair of forward-backward equations for the maximum a posteriori kernels in all layers at once. We study their solutions perturbatively to demonstrate how the backward propagation across layers aligns kernels with the target. An alternative field-theoretic formulation shows that kernel adaptation of the Bayesian posterior at finite-width results from fluctuations in the prior: larger fluctuations correspond to a more flexible network prior and thus enable stronger adaptation to data. We thus find a bridge between the classical edge-of-chaos NNGP theory and feature learning, exposing an intricate interplay between criticality, response functions, and feature scale.">

This paper proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) based on the DeepXDE deep learning library to analyze thermoelastic problems, including classical thermoelastic problems, thermoelastic coupling problems, and generalized thermoelastic problems. The loss function is constructed based on equations, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. Unlike traditional data-driven methods, this approach does not rely on known solutions.

 Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have frequently been used for the numerical approximation of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The goal of this paper is to construct PINNs along with a computable upper bound of the error, which is particularly relevant for model reduction of Parameterized PDEs (PPDEs). To this end, we suggest to use a weighted sum of expansion coefficients of the residual in terms of an adaptive wavelet expansion both for the loss function and an error bound. This approach is shown here for elliptic PPDEs using both the standard variational and an optimally stable ultra-weak formulation. Numerical examples show a very good quantitative effectivity of the wavelet-based error bound.">

Research over the past few years has shown that the answer to all these questions is likely"yes, with enough research": PNNs could one day radically change what is possible and practical for AI systems. To do this will however require rethinking both how AI models work, and how they are trained - primarily by considering the problems through the constraints of the underlying hardware physics. To train PNNs at large scale, many methods including backpropagation-based and backpropagation-free approaches are now being explored. These methods have various trade-offs, and so far no method has been shown to scale to the same scale and performance as the backpropagation algorithm widely used in deep learning today. However, this is rapidly changing, and a diverse ecosystem of training techniques provides clues for how PNNs may one day be utilized to create both more efficient realizations of current-scale AI models, and to enable unprecedented-scale models.">

        <tr id="Of all the vector fields surrounding the minima of recurrent learning setups, the gradient field with its exploding and vanishing updates appears a poor choice for optimization, offering little beyond efficient computability. We seek to improve this suboptimal practice in the context of physics simulations, where backpropagating feedback through many unrolled time steps is considered crucial to acquiring temporally coherent behavior. The alternative vector field we propose follows from two principles: physics simulators, unlike neural networks, have a balanced gradient flow, and certain modifications to the backpropagation pass leave the positions of the original minima unchanged. As any modification of backpropagation decouples forward and backward pass, the rotation-free character of the gradient field is lost. Therefore, we discuss the negative implications of using such a rotational vector field for optimization and how to counteract them. Our final procedure is easily implementable via a sequence of gradient stopping and component-wise comparison operations, which do not negatively affect scalability. Our experiments on three control problems show that especially as we increase the complexity of each task, the unbalanced updates from the gradient can no longer provide the precise control signals necessary while our method still solves the tasks.

        <tr id="There remain numerous unanswered research questions on deep learning (DL) within the classical learning theory framework. These include the remarkable generalization capabilities of overparametrized neural networks (NNs), the efficient optimization performance despite non-convexity of objectives, the mechanism of flat minima for generalization, and the exceptional performance of deep architectures in solving physical problems. This paper introduces General Distribution Learning (GD Learning), a novel theoretical learning framework designed to address a comprehensive range of machine learning and statistical tasks, including classification, regression and parameter estimation. Departing from traditional statistical machine learning, GD Learning focuses on the true underlying distribution. In GD Learning, learning error, corresponding to the expected error in classical statistical learning framework, is divided into fitting errors due to models and algorithms, as well as sampling errors introduced by limited sampling data. The framework significantly incorporates prior knowledge, especially in scenarios characterized by data scarcity, thereby enhancing performance. Within the GD Learning framework, we demonstrate that the global optimal solutions in non-convex optimization can be approached by minimizing the gradient norm and the non-uniformity of the eigenvalues of the model's Jacobian matrix. This insight leads to the development of the gradient structure control algorithm. GD Learning also offers fresh insights into the questions on deep learning, including overparameterization and non-convex optimization, bias-variance trade-off, and the mechanism of flat minima.">

The model is applied to the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) plasma turbulence model, that is closely related to the quasigeostrophic model used in geophysical fluid dynamics.

        <tr id="Identifying Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) from measurement data requires both fitting the dynamics and assimilating, either implicitly or explicitly, the measurement data. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method involves a derivative estimation step (and optionally, smoothing) and a sparse regression step on a library of candidate ODE terms. Kalman smoothing is a classical framework for assimilating the measurement data with known noise statistics. Previously, derivatives in SINDy and its python package, pysindy, had been estimated by finite difference, L1 total variation minimization, or local filters like Savitzky-Golay. In contrast, Kalman allows discovering ODEs that best recreate the essential dynamics in simulation, even in cases when it does not perform as well at recovering coefficients, as measured by their F1 score and mean absolute error. We have incorporated Kalman smoothing, along with hyperparameter optimization, into the existing pysindy architecture, allowing for rapid adoption of the method. Numerical experiments on a number of dynamical systems show Kalman smoothing to be the most amenable to parameter selection and best at preserving problem structure in the presence of noise.">

Despite recent developments, complex phenomena such as high-Reynolds-number (high-[Formula: see text]) flow remain a modeling challenge without the use of high-fidelity inputs. In this study, a low-fidelity-influenced physics-informed neural network (LF-PINN) is proposed as a surrogate aerodynamic analysis model for inverse airfoil shape design at [Formula: see text]. The LF-PINN is developed in a hybrid approach using low-fidelity flowfields approximated from a viscous-inviscid coupled airfoil analysis tool (mfoil) and physics residuals from the steady, incompressible, two-dimensional Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. The approach is designed to alleviate offline computational costs by avoiding high-fidelity simulations and sustain predicting accuracy using corrections by the physics residuals. The LF-PINN is able to correct the low-fidelity flowfield quantities toward the ground truth, with a mean improvement of about 19% in pressure and about 5% in total velocity based on Euclidean distance comparisons. Evaluation of the airfoil surface pressure coefficient [Formula: see text] distributions shows corrections by the LF-PINN at the suction peak, which largely contributes to lifting forces. Inverse airfoil shape design is conducted using target [Formula: see text] distributions in the objective function, whereby the LF-PINN can approach the expected target shapes while reducing online computational time by at least an order of magnitude compared to direct airfoil analysis tools.">

Such operator learning models not only predict particular instances of a physical or biological system in real-time but also forecast classes of solutions corresponding to a distribution of initial and boundary conditions or forcing terms. % DeepONet is the first neural operator model and has been tested extensively for a broad class of solutions, including Riemann problems. Transformers have not been used in that capacity, and specifically, they have not been tested for solutions of PDEs with low regularity. % In this work, we first establish the theoretical groundwork that transformers possess the universal approximation property as operator learning models. We then apply transformers to forecast solutions of diverse dynamical systems with solutions of finite regularity for a plurality of initial conditions and forcing terms. In particular, we consider three examples: the Izhikevich neuron model, the tempered fractional-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, and the one-dimensional Euler equation Riemann problem. For the latter problem, we also compare with variants of DeepONet, and we find that transformers outperform DeepONet in accuracy but they are computationally more expensive.">

However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.">

        <tr id="The study of effective connectivity (EC) is essential in understanding how the brain integrates and responds to various sensory inputs. Model-driven estimation of EC is a powerful approach that requires estimating global and local parameters of a generative model of neural activity. Insights gathered through this process can be used in various applications, such as studying neurodevelopmental disorders. However, accurately determining EC through generative models remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of brain dynamics and the inherent noise in neural recordings, e.g., in electroencephalography (EEG). Current model-driven methods to study EC are computationally complex and cannot scale to all brain regions as required by whole-brain analyses. To facilitate EC assessment, an inference algorithm must exhibit reliable prediction of parameters in the presence of noise. Further, the relationship between the model parameters and the neural recordings must be learnable. To progress toward these objectives, we benchmarked the performance of a Bi-LSTM model for parameter inference from the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) simulated EEG under various noise conditions. Additionally, our study explores how the JR-NMM reacts to changes in key biological parameters (i.e., sensitivity analysis) like synaptic gains and time constants, a crucial step in understanding the connection between neural mechanisms and observed brain activity. Our results indicate that we can predict the local JR-NMM parameters from EEG, supporting the feasibility of our deep-learning-based inference approach. In future work, we plan to extend this framework to estimate local and global parameters from real EEG in clinically relevant applications.">

Here, we propose the Gradient Matching GTS (GMGTS) method as an efficient alternative to GTS. Gradient matching offers an integration-free approach to parameter estimation that is particularly powerful for dynamical systems that are linear in the unknown parameters, such as biochemical networks modeled by mass action kinetics. Here, we harness the power of gradient matching by integrating it into the GTS framework. To this end, we significantly expand the capabilities of gradient matching via uncertainty propagation calculations and the development of an iterative estimation scheme for partially observed systems. Through comparisons of GMGTS with GTS in different inference setups, we demonstrate that our method provides a significant computational advantage, thereby facilitating the use of complex NLME models in systems biology applications.">

        <tr id="The threat of geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) to the reliable operation of the bulk energy system has spurred the development of effective strategies for mitigating their impacts. One such approach involves placing transformer neutral blocking devices, which interrupt the path of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to limit their impact. The high cost of these devices and the sparsity of transformers that experience high GICs during GMD events, however, calls for a sparse placement strategy that involves high computational cost. To address this challenge, we developed a physics-informed heterogeneous graph neural network (PIHGNN) for solving the graph-based dc-blocker placement problem. Our approach combines a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) with a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to capture the diverse types of nodes and edges in ac/dc networks and incorporates the physical laws of the power grid. We train the PIHGNN model using a surrogate power flow model and validate it using case studies. Results demonstrate that PIHGNN can effectively and efficiently support the deployment of GIC dc-current blockers, ensuring the continued supply of electricity to meet societal demands.

        <tr id="Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others.">

        <tr id="It is a challenging topic in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Standard approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs suffer under the curse of dimensionality (COD) in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation method grows at least exponentially in the PDE dimension and with such methods it is essentially impossible to approximately solve high-dimensional PDEs even when the fastest currently available computers are used. However, in the last years great progress has been made in this area of research through suitable deep learning (DL) based methods for PDEs in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate solutions of PDEs. Despite the remarkable success of such DL methods in simulations, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to prove (or disprove) that such methods can overcome the COD in the approximation of PDEs. However, there are nowadays several partial error analysis results for DL methods for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs in the literature which prove that DNNs can overcome the COD in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ and the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In the main result of this article we prove that for all $T,p\in(0,\infty)$ it holds that solutions $u_d\colon[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, of semilinear heat equations with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated in the $L^p$-sense on space-time regions without the COD by DNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU), the leaky ReLU, or the softplus activation function. In previous articles similar results have been established not for space-time regions but for the solutions $u_d(T,\cdot)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, at the terminal time $T$.">

        <tr id="State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.">

 In this paper, we investigate the full-waveform inversion (FWI) for elastic wave equation as training a neural network. The forward modeling of the elastic wave equation in the time domain by the staggered-grid difference schemes can be reformulated as a process of a recurrent neural network (RNN). As a result, the FWI problem is equivalent to neural network training, and the parameter of RNN coincides with the model parameter of inversion. Furthermore, a variety of stochastic optimizers including Adgrad, RMSprop, Adam, Nadam and Admax in neural networks can be applied in the training process. The gradient of the objective function with the model parameters is computed by the technique of automatic differentiation instead of the adjoint-state method in the traditional FWI. A new objective function of FWI is also proposed. Compared to the traditional FWI methods, the developed FWI using tools of neural networks has a relatively good robustness. Numerical computations and comparisons with Marmousi model for two and three parameters simultaneous inversion are completed. The results show that the algorithms except Adgrad can yield good inversion results. The FWI framework developed in this paper has potential applications for other complex partial equations.">

Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming. In experiments across a diverse range of dynamical systems, our approach demonstrates better robustness against noise and recovers governing equations with significantly higher probability than baselines without symmetry.">

Despite the advantages of PNN for inference, training remains a challenge.

Here, we present the asymmetrical training (AT) method, which treats the PNN structure as a grey box. AT performs training while only knowing the last layer output and neuron topological connectivity of a deep neural network structure, not requiring information about the physical control-transformation mapping. We experimentally demonstrated the AT method on deep grey-box PNNs implemented by uncalibrated photonic integrated circuits (PICs), improving the classification accuracy of Iris flower and modified MNIST hand-written digits from random guessing to near theoretical maximum. We also showcased the consistently enhanced performance of AT over BP for different datasets, including MNIST, fashion-MNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST. The AT method demonstrated successful training with minimal hardware overhead and reduced computational overhead, serving as a robust light-weight training alternative to fully explore the advantages of physical computation.">

Despite these advances, our understanding of how pretraining affects neural operators is still limited; studies generally propose tailored architectures and datasets that make it challenging to compare or examine different pretraining frameworks. To address this, we compare various pretraining methods without optimizing architecture choices to characterize pretraining dynamics on different models and datasets as well as to understand its scaling and generalization behavior. We find that pretraining is highly dependent on model and dataset choices, but in general transfer learning or physics-based pretraining strategies work best. In addition, pretraining performance can be further improved by using data augmentations. Lastly, pretraining is additionally beneficial when fine-tuning in scarce data regimes or when generalizing to downstream data similar to the pretraining distribution. Through providing insights into pretraining neural operators for physics prediction, we hope to motivate future work in developing and evaluating pretraining methods for PDEs.">

For instance, in neuroscience, discovering neuron-to-neuron interactions is essential for understanding brain function; in ecology, recognizing the interactions among populations is key for understanding complex ecosystems. Such systems, often modeled as dynamical systems, typically exhibit noisy high-dimensional and non-stationary temporal behavior that renders their identification challenging. Existing dynamical system identification methods often yield operators that accurately capture short-term behavior but fail to predict long-term trends, suggesting an incomplete capture of the underlying process. Methods that consider extended forecasts (e.g., recurrent neural networks) lack explicit representations of element-wise interactions and require substantial training data, thereby failing to capture interpretable network operators. Here we introduce Lookahead-driven Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability (LINOCS), a robust learning procedure for identifying hidden dynamical interactions in noisy time-series data. LINOCS integrates several multi-step predictions with adaptive weights during training to recover dynamical operators that can yield accurate long-term predictions. We demonstrate LINOCS' ability to recover the ground truth dynamical operators underlying synthetic time-series data for multiple dynamical systems models (including linear, piece-wise linear, time-changing linear systems' decomposition, and regularized linear time-varying systems) as well as its capability to produce meaningful operators with robust reconstructions through various real-world examples.">

It operates mainly by imposing a data, learning or inductive bias with simulation data, Partial Differential Equations or equivariance and invariance properties. While these models have shown great success on tasks involving one physical domain such as fluid dynamics, existing methods still struggle on tasks with complex multi-physical and multi-domain phenomena. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach together with Graph Neural Network. We thus propose Neural Bond Graph Encoder (NBgE), a model agnostic physical-informed encoder tailored for multi-physics systems. It provides an unified framework for any multi-physics informed AI with a graph encoder readable for any deep learning model. Our experiments on two challenging multi-domain physical systems - a Direct Current Motor and the Respiratory system - demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a multi-variate time series forecasting task.">

        <tr id="Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.">

        <tr id="Operator learning problems arise in many key areas of scientific computing where Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are used to model physical systems. In such scenarios, the operators map between Banach or Hilbert spaces. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning operators between Banach spaces, in contrast to the vast majority of past works considering only Hilbert spaces. We focus on learning holomorphic operators - an important class of problems with many applications. We combine arbitrary approximate encoders and decoders with standard feedforward Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures - specifically, those with constant width exceeding the depth - under standard $\ell^2$-loss minimization. We first identify a family of DNNs such that the resulting Deep Learning (DL) procedure achieves optimal generalization bounds for such operators. For standard fully-connected architectures, we then show that there are uncountably many minimizers of the training problem that yield equivalent optimal performance. The DNN architectures we consider are `problem agnostic', with width and depth only depending on the amount of training data $m$ and not on regularity assumptions of the target operator. Next, we show that DL is optimal for this problem: no recovery procedure can surpass these generalization bounds up to log terms. Finally, we present numerical results demonstrating the practical performance on challenging problems including the parametric diffusion, Navier-Stokes-Brinkman and Boussinesq PDEs.">

While the results were obtained, the number of hidden layers and the number of neural networks in the layers also varied. These results are shown in tables.

More specifically, by replacing the standard KL divergence with the R\'enyi divergence between the posterior and the approximated prior, we ameliorate the impact of the misspecified prior via a parameter {\alpha} so that the resulting posterior focuses more on tail samples and reduce density on overconfident regions. Our experiments showed log-likelihood improvements on several existing NP families.

Many studies tried to combine the measurement into diffusion by score function replacement, matrix decomposition, or optimization algorithms, but it is hard to balance the data consistency and realness. The slow sampling speed is also a main obstacle to its wide application. To address the challenges, we propose Deep Data Consistency (DDC) to update the data consistency step with a deep learning model when solving inverse problems with diffusion models. By analyzing existing methods, the variational bound training objective is used to maximize the conditional posterior and reduce its impact on the diffusion process. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods in linear and non-linear tasks, DDC demonstrates its outstanding performance of both similarity and realness metrics in generating high-quality solutions with only 5 inference steps in 0.77 seconds on average. In addition, the robustness of DDC is well illustrated in the experiments across datasets, with large noise and the capacity to solve multiple tasks in only one pre-trained model.">

In practice, however, we only find solutions accessible via our training procedure, including the optimizer and regularizers, limiting flexibility. Moreover, the exact parameterization of the function class, built into an architecture, shapes its loss surface and impacts the minima we find. In this work, we examine the ability of neural networks to fit data in practice. Our findings indicate that: (1) standard optimizers find minima where the model can only fit training sets with significantly fewer samples than it has parameters; (2) convolutional networks are more parameter-efficient than MLPs and ViTs, even on randomly labeled data; (3) while stochastic training is thought to have a regularizing effect, SGD actually finds minima that fit more training data than full-batch gradient descent; (4) the difference in capacity to fit correctly labeled and incorrectly labeled samples can be predictive of generalization; (5) ReLU activation functions result in finding minima that fit more data despite being designed to avoid vanishing and exploding gradients in deep architectures.">

More importantly, however, a non-random subsampling technique--scalable subsampling--is applied to construct a `subagged' DNN estimator. Under regularity conditions, it is shown that the subagged DNN estimator is computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy for either estimation or prediction tasks. Beyond point estimation/prediction, we propose different approaches to build confidence and prediction intervals based on the subagged DNN estimator. In addition to being asymptotically valid, the proposed confidence/prediction intervals appear to work well in finite samples. All in all, the scalable subsampling DNN estimator offers the complete package in terms of statistical inference, i.e., (a) computational efficiency; (b) point estimation/prediction accuracy; and (c) allowing for the construction of practically useful confidence and prediction intervals.">

We prove that this property of mini-batch SGD is due to a second-order implicit regularization effect which is proportional to $\eta / b$ (step size / batch size). Our results are not only another proof that implicit regularization has a significant impact on training optimization dynamics but they also shed light on the structure of the features that are learned by the network.

With advancements in genotyping, early diagnosis is now possible, potentially preventing such damage. However, the intricate structure of muscle and its myriad proteins make treatment predictions challenging. Here we approach the problem of estimating therapeutic targets for a mutation in mouse muscle using a spatially explicit half sarcomere muscle model. We selected 9 rate parameters in our model linked to both small molecules and cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. We then randomly varied these rate parameters and simulated an isometric twitch for each combination to generate a large training dataset. We used this dataset to train a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), a technique used in Bayesian parameter estimation. Given simulated or experimental isometric twitches, this machine learning model is able to then predict the set of rate parameters which are most likely to yield that result. We then predict the set of rate parameters associated with both control and the cardiac Troponin C (cTnC) I61Q variant in mouse trabeculae and model parameters that recover the abnormal I61Q cTnC twitches. SIGNIFICANCE Machine learning techniques have potential to accelerate discoveries in biologically complex systems. However, they require large data sets and can be challenging in high dimensional systems such as cardiac muscle. In this study, we combined experimental measures of cardiac muscle twitch forces with mechanistic simulations and a newly developed mixture of Bayesian inference with neural networks (in autoencoders) to solve the inverse problem of determining the underlying kinetics for observed force generation by cardiac muscle. The autoencoders are trained on millions of simulations spanning parameter spaces that correspond to the mechanochemistry of cardiac sarcomeres. We apply the trained model to experimental data in order to infer parameters that can explain a diseased twitch and ways to recover it.">

        <tr id="With the advancement of technology, autonomous driving has become a popular research field. However, designing an autonomous driving system that can handle complex environments and meet real-time requirements remains an open challenge. In this study, we explore how to implement an efficient and reliable autonomous driving system using deep learning techniques. We experimented with a series of deep learning models, including VGG16, Inception series models, ResNet, MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121. By comparing the performance of these models on our dataset, we identified the best performing ones and fine-tuned them to optimize their performance for our task. In addition, to further improve the performance of the model, we introduced a spatial channel attention mechanism. We found that deploying the spatial channel attention mechanism at appropriate locations could significantly improve the performance of the model. However, deploying the spatial channel attention mechanism at all locations might cause the model to focus too much on local features and ignore global features. Overall, our results show that the performance of autonomous driving systems can be effectively improved by improving the network structure and training methods.">

However, little is known in the case of finite-width architectures with multiple outputs and convolutional layers. In this manuscript, we provide rigorous results for the statistics of functions implemented by the aforementioned class of networks, thus moving closer to a complete characterization of feature learning in the Bayesian setting. Our results include: (i) an exact and elementary non-asymptotic integral representation for the joint prior distribution over the outputs, given in terms of a mixture of Gaussians; (ii) an analytical formula for the posterior distribution in the case of squared error loss function (Gaussian likelihood); (iii) a quantitative description of the feature learning infinite-width regime, using large deviation theory. From a physical perspective, deep architectures with multiple outputs or convolutional layers represent different manifestations of kernel shape renormalization, and our work provides a dictionary that translates this physics intuition and terminology into rigorous Bayesian statistics.">

        <tr id="In this study, we introduce a unified neural network architecture, the Deep Equilibrium Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian (DEQH) model, which incorporates Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) for predicting Density Functional Theory (DFT) Hamiltonians. The DEQH model inherently captures the self-consistency nature of Hamiltonian, a critical aspect often overlooked by traditional machine learning approaches for Hamiltonian prediction. By employing DEQ within our model architecture, we circumvent the need for DFT calculations during the training phase to introduce the Hamiltonian's self-consistency, thus addressing computational bottlenecks associated with large or complex systems. We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian. Ablation studies of DEQHNet further elucidate the network's effectiveness, offering insights into the potential of DEQ-integrated networks for Hamiltonian learning.">

Their prevalence in CFD scenarios has motivated the exploration of innovative approaches for generating reduced-order models. The core of our approach centers on geometric deep learning, specifically the utilization of graph convolutional network (GCN). The novel Autoencoder GCN architecture enhances prediction accuracy by propagating information to distant nodes and emphasizing influential points. This architecture, with GCN layers and encoding/decoding modules, reduces dimensionality based on pressure-gradient values. The autoencoder structure improves the network capability to identify key features, contributing to a more robust and accurate predictive model. To validate the proposed methodology, we analyzed two different test cases: wing-only model and wing--body configuration. Precise reconstruction of steady-state distributed quantities within a two-dimensional parametric space underscores the reliability and versatility of the implemented approach.">

        <tr id="A Deep Learning approach is devised to estimate the elastic energy density $\rho$ at the free surface of an undulated stressed film. About 190000 arbitrary surface profiles h(x) are randomly generated by Perlin noise and paired with the corresponding elastic energy density profiles $\rho(x)$, computed by a semi-analytical Green's function approximation, suitable for small-slope morphologies. The resulting dataset and smaller subsets of it are used for the training of a Fully Convolutional Neural Network. The trained models are shown to return quantitative predictions of $\rho$, not only in terms of convergence of the loss function during training, but also in validation and testing, with better results in the case of the larger dataset. Extensive tests are performed to assess the generalization capability of the Neural Network model when applied to profiles with localized features or assigned geometries not included in the original dataset. Moreover, its possible exploitation on domain sizes beyond the one used in the training is also analyzed in-depth. The conditions providing a one-to-one reproduction of the ground-truth $\rho(x)$ profiles computed by the Green's approximation are highlighted along with critical cases. The accuracy and robustness of the deep-learned $\rho(x)$ are further demonstrated in the time-integration of surface evolution problems described by simple partial differential equations of evaporation/condensation and surface diffusion.">

Instead of relying on petabyte-scale data-driven learning, ElastoGen leverages the principles of physics-in-the-loop and learns from established physical knowledge, such as partial differential equations and their numerical solutions. The core idea of ElastoGen is converting the global differential operator, corresponding to the nonlinear elastodynamic equations, into iterative local convolution-like operations, which naturally fit modern neural networks. Each network module is specifically designed to support this goal rather than functioning as a black box. As a result, ElastoGen is exceptionally lightweight in terms of both training requirements and network scale. Additionally, due to its alignment with physical procedures, ElastoGen efficiently generates accurate dynamics for a wide range of hyperelastic materials and can be easily integrated with upstream and downstream deep modules to enable end-to-end 4D generation.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models excel at creating visually-convincing images, but they often struggle to meet subtle constraints inherent in the training data. Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model not only improves its distribution-matching accuracy but also makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are inflexible with different types of constraints. Recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs) in an unconstrained space defined by a mirror map and to impose the constraint with an inverse mirror map, but analytical mirror maps are challenging to derive for complex constraints. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that pushes data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.">

        <tr id="The discretization of the deep Ritz method [18] for the Poisson equation leads to a high-dimensional non-convex minimization problem, that is difficult and expensive to solve numerically. In this paper, we consider the shallow Ritz approximation to one-dimensional diffusion problems and introduce an effective and efficient iterative method, a damped block Newton (dBN) method, for solving the resulting non-convex minimization problem. The method employs the block Gauss-Seidel method as an outer iteration by dividing the parameters of a shallow neural network into the linear parameters (the weights and bias of the output layer) and the non-linear parameters (the weights and bias of the hidden layer). Per each outer iteration, the linear and the non-linear parameters are updated by exact inversion and one step of a damped Newton method, respectively. Inverses of the coefficient matrix and the Hessian matrix are tridiagonal and diagonal, respectively, and hence the cost of each dBN iteration is $\mathcal{O}(n)$. To move the breakpoints (the non-linear parameters) more efficiently, we propose an adaptive damped block Newton (AdBN) method by combining the dBN with the adaptive neuron enhancement (ANE) method [25]. Numerical examples demonstrate the ability of dBN and AdBN not only to move the breakpoints quickly and efficiently but also to achieve a nearly optimal order of convergence for AdBN. These iterative solvers are capable of outperforming BFGS for select examples.">

Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks.

        <tr id="Data assimilation aims to estimate the states of a dynamical system by optimally combining sparse and noisy observations of the physical system with uncertain forecasts produced by a computational model. The states of many dynamical systems of interest obey nonlinear physical constraints, and the corresponding dynamics is confined to a certain sub-manifold of the state space. Standard data assimilation techniques applied to such systems yield posterior states lying outside the manifold, violating the physical constraints. This work focuses on particle flow filters which use stochastic differential equations to evolve state samples from a prior distribution to samples from an observation-informed posterior distribution. The variational Fokker-Planck (VFP) -- a generic particle flow filtering framework -- is extended to incorporate non-linear, equality state constraints in the analysis. To this end, two algorithmic approaches that modify the VFP stochastic differential equation are discussed: (i) VFPSTAB, to inexactly preserve constraints with the addition of a stabilizing drift term, and (ii) VFPDAE, to exactly preserve constraints by treating the VFP dynamics as a stochastic differential-algebraic equation (SDAE). Additionally, an implicit-explicit time integrator is developed to evolve the VFPDAE dynamics. The strength of the proposed approach for constraint preservation in data assimilation is demonstrated on three test problems: the double pendulum, Korteweg-de-Vries, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.">

In this paper, we propose a novel method called \emph{optimum shifting}, which changes the parameters of a neural network from a sharp minimum to a flatter one while maintaining the same training loss value. Our method is based on the observation that when the input and output of a neural network are fixed, the matrix multiplications within the network can be treated as systems of under-determined linear equations, enabling adjustment of parameters in the solution space, which can be simply accomplished by solving a constrained optimization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a practical stochastic optimum shifting technique utilizing the Neural Collapse theory to reduce computational costs and provide more degrees of freedom for optimum shifting. Extensive experiments (including classification and detection) with various deep neural network architectures on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.">

        <tr id="Linearity of Koopman operators and simplicity of their estimators coupled with model-reduction capabilities has lead to their great popularity in applications for learning dynamical systems. While nonparametric Koopman operator learning in infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is well understood for autonomous systems, its control system analogues are largely unexplored. Addressing systems with control inputs in a principled manner is crucial for fully data-driven learning of controllers, especially since existing approaches commonly resort to representational heuristics or parametric models of limited expressiveness and scalability. We address the aforementioned challenge by proposing a universal framework via control-affine reproducing kernels that enables direct estimation of a single operator even for control systems. The proposed approach, called control-Koopman operator regression (cKOR), is thus completely analogous to Koopman operator regression of the autonomous case. First in the literature, we present a nonparametric framework for learning Koopman operator representations of nonlinear control-affine systems that does not suffer from the curse of control input dimensionality. This allows for reformulating the infinite-dimensional learning problem in a finite-dimensional space based solely on data without apriori loss of precision due to a restriction to a finite span of functions or inputs as in other approaches. For enabling applications to large-scale control systems, we also enhance the scalability of control-Koopman operator estimators by leveraging random projections (sketching). The efficacy of our novel cKOR approach is demonstrated on both forecasting and control tasks.">

        <tr id="We propose a deep learning algorithm for high dimensional optimal stopping problems. Our method is inspired by the penalty method for solving free boundary PDEs. Within our approach, the penalized PDE is approximated using the Deep BSDE framework proposed by \cite{weinan2017deep}, which leads us to coin the term"Deep Penalty Method (DPM)"to refer to our algorithm. We show that the error of the DPM can be bounded by the loss function and $O(\frac{1}{\lambda})+O(\lambda h) +O(\sqrt{h})$, where $h$ is the step size in time and $\lambda$ is the penalty parameter. This finding emphasizes the need for careful consideration when selecting the penalization parameter and suggests that the discretization error converges at a rate of order $\frac{1}{2}$. We validate the efficacy of the DPM through numerical tests conducted on a high-dimensional optimal stopping model in the area of American option pricing. The numerical tests confirm both the accuracy and the computational efficiency of our proposed algorithm.">

        <tr id="Success of machine learning (ML) in the modern world is largely determined by abundance of data. However at many industrial and scientific problems, amount of data is limited. Application of ML methods to data-scarce scientific problems can be made more effective via several routes, one of them is equivariant neural networks possessing knowledge of symmetries. Here we suggest that combination of symmetry-aware invariant architectures and stacks of dilated convolutions is a very effective and easy to implement receipt allowing sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches. We apply it to representative physical problems from different realms: prediction of bandgaps of photonic crystals, and network approximations of magnetic ground states. The suggested invariant multiscale architectures increase expressibility of networks, which allow them to perform better in all considered cases.">

 In this paper, we introduce the deep numerical technique DeepNM, which is designed for solving one-dimensional (1D) hyperbolic conservation laws, particularly wave equations. By creatively integrating traditional numerical schemes with deep learning techniques, the method yields improvements over conventional approaches. Specifically, we compare this approach against two established classical numerical methods: the Discontinuous Galerkin method (DG) and the Lax-Wendroff correction method (LWC). While maintaining a comparable level of accuracy, DeepNM significantly improves computational speed, surpassing conventional numerical methods in this aspect by more than tenfold, and reducing storage requirements by over 1000 times. Furthermore, DeepNM facilitates the utilization of higher-order numerical schemes and allows for an increased number of grid points, thereby enhancing precision. In contrast to the more prevalent PINN method, DeepNM optimally combines the strengths of conventional mathematical techniques with deep learning, resulting in heightened accuracy and expedited computations for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Notably, DeepNM introduces a novel research paradigm for numerical equation-solving that can be seamlessly integrated with various traditional numerical methods.">

Purpose
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become a new tendency in flow simulation, because of their self-advantage of integrating both physical and monitored information of fields in solving the Navier–Stokes equation and its variants. In view of the strengths of PINN, this study aims to investigate the impact of spatially embedded data distribution on the flow field results around the train in the crosswind environment reconstructed by PINN.


Design/methodology/approach
PINN can integrate data residuals with physical residuals into the loss function to train its parameters, allowing it to approximate the solution of the governing equations. In addition, with the aid of labelled training data, PINN can also incorporate the real site information of the flow field in model training. In light of this, the PINN model is adopted to reconstruct a two-dimensional time-averaged flow field around a train under crosswinds in the spatial domain with the aid of sparse flow field data, and the prediction results are compared with the reference results obtained from numerical modelling.


Findings
The prediction results from PINN results demonstrated a low discrepancy with those obtained from numerical simulations. The results of this study indicate that a threshold of the spatial embedded data density exists, in both the near wall and far wall areas on the train’s leeward side, as well as the near train surface area. In other words, a negative effect on the PINN reconstruction accuracy will emerge if the spatial embedded data density exceeds or slips below the threshold. Also, the optimum arrangement of the spatial embedded data in reconstructing the flow field of the train in crosswinds is obtained in this work.


Originality/value
In this work, a strategy of reconstructing the time-averaged flow field of the train under crosswind conditions is proposed based on the physics-informed data-driven method, which enhances the scope of neural network applications. In addition, for the flow field reconstruction, the effect of spatial embedded data arrangement in PINN is compared to improve its accuracy.

        <tr id="Intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity is nowadays understood to play a critical role in disease progression and treatment failure. Accordingly, there has been increasing interest in the development of mathematical models capable of capturing its role in cancer cell adaptation. This can be systematically achieved by means of models comprising phenotype-structured nonlocal partial differential equations, tracking the evolution of the phenotypic density distribution of the cell population, which may be compared to gene and protein expression distributions obtained experimentally. Nevertheless, given the high analytical and computational cost of solving these models, much is to be gained from reducing them to systems of ordinary differential equations for the moments of the distribution. We propose a generalised method of model-reduction, relying on the use of a moment generating function, Taylor series expansion and truncation closure, to reduce a nonlocal reaction-advection-diffusion equation, with general phenotypic drift and proliferation rate functions, to a system of moment equations up to arbitrary order. Our method extends previous results in the literature, which we address via two examples, by removing any \textit{a priori} assumption on the shape of the distribution, and provides a flexible framework for mathematical modellers to account for the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer adaptive dynamics, in a simpler mathematical framework.">

        <tr id="Multi-dimensional parameter spaces are commonly encountered in astroparticle physics theories that attempt to capture novel phenomena. However, they often possess complicated posterior geometries that are expensive to traverse using techniques traditional to this community. Effectively sampling these spaces is crucial to bridge the gap between experiment and theory. Several recent innovations, which are only beginning to make their way into this field, have made navigating such complex posteriors possible. These include GPU acceleration, automatic differentiation, and neural-network-guided reparameterization. We apply these advancements to astroparticle physics experimental results in the context of novel neutrino physics and benchmark their performances against traditional nested sampling techniques. Compared to nested sampling alone, we find that these techniques increase performance for both nested sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, accelerating inference by factors of $\sim 100$ and $\sim 60$, respectively. As nested sampling also evaluates the Bayesian evidence, these advancements can be exploited to improve model comparison performance while retaining compatibility with existing implementations that are widely used in the natural sciences.">

This framework is then used to build a novel finite neuron method to solve the 2nd order elliptic equations with the Dirichlet boundary condition. Our algorithm is the first algorithm, proven to lead to shallow neural network solutions with an optimal H1 norm error. We show that a widely used penalized PDE, which imposes the Dirichlet boundary condition weakly can be interpreted as the first element of the sequence of PDEs within our framework. Furthermore, numerically, we show that it may not lead to the solution with the optimal H1 norm error bound in general. On the other hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the second and later elements of a sequence of PDEs can lead to an adequate solution with the optimal H1 norm error bound. A number of sample tests are performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the relevant theory.">

        <tr id="Introduction Mpox (formerly monkeypox) is an infectious disease that spreads mostly through direct contact with infected animals or people's blood, bodily fluids, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions. In light of the global outbreak that occurred in 2022–2023, in this paper, we analyzed global Mpox univariate time series data and provided a comprehensive analysis of disease outbreaks across the world, including the USA with Brazil and three continents: North America, South America, and Europe. The novelty of this study is that it delved into the Mpox time series data by implementing the data-driven methods and a mathematical model concurrently—an aspect not typically addressed in the existing literature. The study is also important because implementing these models concurrently improved our predictions' reliability for infectious diseases. Methods We proposed a traditional compartmental model and also implemented deep learning models (1D- convolutional neural network (CNN), long-short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), hybrid CNN-LSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM) as well as statistical time series models: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and exponential smoothing on the Mpox data. We also employed the least squares method fitting to estimate the essential epidemiological parameters in the proposed deterministic model. Results The primary finding of the deterministic model is that vaccination rates can flatten the curve of infected dynamics and influence the basic reproduction number. Through the numerical simulations, we determined that increased vaccination among the susceptible human population is crucial to control disease transmission. Moreover, in case of an outbreak, our model showed the potential for epidemic control by adjusting the key epidemiological parameters, namely the baseline contact rate and the proportion of contacts within the human population. Next, we analyzed data-driven models that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of disease dynamics in different locations. Additionally, we trained models to provide short-term (eight-week) predictions across various geographical locations, and all eight models produced reliable results. Conclusion This study utilized a comprehensive framework to investigate univariate time series data to understand the dynamics of Mpox transmission. The prediction showed that Mpox is in its die-out situation as of July 29, 2023. Moreover, the deterministic model showed the importance of the Mpox vaccination in mitigating the Mpox transmission and highlighted the significance of effectively adjusting key epidemiological parameters during outbreaks, particularly the contact rate in high-risk groups.">

However, they have several drawbacks, including training instability and inability to cover the entire data distribution, especially for regions where data are rare. This is particularly challenging for whole-event, full-detector simulations in high-energy heavy-ion experiments, such as sPHENIX at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider experiments, where thousands of particles are produced per event and interact with the detector. This work investigates the effectiveness of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) as an AI-based generative surrogate model for the sPHENIX experiment that includes the heavy-ion event generation and response of the entire calorimeter stack. DDPM performance in sPHENIX simulation data is compared with a popular rival, GANs. Results show that both DDPMs and GANs can reproduce the data distribution where the examples are abundant (low-to-medium calorimeter energies). Nonetheless, DDPMs significantly outperform GANs, especially in high-energy regions where data are rare. Additionally, DDPMs exhibit superior stability compared to GANs. The results are consistent between both central and peripheral centrality heavy-ion collision events. Moreover, DDPMs offer a substantial speedup of approximately a factor of 100 compared to the traditional Geant4 simulation method.">

        <tr id="Living organisms exhibit remarkable adaptations across all scales, from molecules to ecosystems. We believe that many of these adaptations correspond to optimal solutions driven by evolution, training, and underlying physical and chemical laws and constraints. While some argue against such optimality principles due to their potential ambiguity, we propose generalized inverse optimal control to infer them directly from data. This novel approach incorporates multi-criteria optimality, nestedness of objective functions on different scales, the presence of active constraints, the possibility of switches of optimality principles during the observed time horizon, maximization of robustness, and minimization of time as important special cases, as well as uncertainties involved with the mathematical modeling of biological systems. This data-driven approach ensures that optimality principles are not merely theoretical constructs but are firmly rooted in experimental observations. Furthermore, the inferred principles can be used in forward optimal control to predict and manipulate biological systems, with possible applications in bio-medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. As discussed and illustrated, the well-posed problem formulation and the inference are challenging and require a substantial interdisciplinary effort in the development of theory and robust numerical methods.">

While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.">

To overcome the well-known overconfidence of classical variational methods, we use a hybrid-VI scheme where the (possibly flat or multimodal) posterior over the measurement parameters is estimated using a forward KL loss while the (nearly convex) conditional posterior over the couplings is estimated using the highly scalable gradient-based VI.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a new paradigm for obtaining accurate ToF in non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and have been demonstrated for such complicated conditions. However, the generalizability of ToF-CNNs has not been investigated. In this work, we analyze the generalizability of the ToF-CNN for broader applications, given limited training data. We first investigate the CNN performance with respect to training dataset size and different training data and test data parameters (container dimensions and material properties). Furthermore, we perform a series of tests to understand the distribution of data parameters that need to be incorporated in training for enhanced model generalizability. This is investigated by training the model on a set of small- and large-container datasets regardless of the test data. We observe that the quantity of data partitioned for training must be of a good representation of the entire sets and sufficient to span through the input space. The result of the network also shows that the learning model with the training data on small containers delivers a sufficiently stable result on different feature interactions compared to the learning model with the training data on large containers. To check the robustness of the model, we tested the trained model to predict the ToF of different sound speed mediums, which shows excellent accuracy. Furthermore, to mimic real experimental scenarios, data are augmented by adding noise. We envision that the proposed approach will extend the applications of CNNs for ToF prediction in a broader range.">

Confined within a harmonic trap, the gas is subject to fluid-gaseous coupled dynamics that lead to a breakdown of first-order hydrodynamics. An attempt to treat these higher-order hydrodynamic effects was previously made with a Gaussian ansatz and coarse-graining model parameter [R. R. W. Wang&J. L. Bohn, Phys. Rev. A 108, 013322 (2023)], leading to an approximate set of equations for a few collective observables accessible to experiments. Here we present substantially improved reduced-order models for these same observables, admissible beyond previous parameter regimes, discovered directly from particle simulations using the WSINDy algorithm (Weak-form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics). The interpretable nature of the learning algorithm enables estimation of previously unknown physical quantities and discovery of model terms with candidate physical mechanisms, revealing new physics in mixed collisional regimes.

Despite the advances in high-throughput technologies, large-scale experiments typically remain prohibitively expensive. Here we introduce a machine learning platform, structure-augmented regression (SAR), that exploits the intrinsic structure of each biological system to learn a high-accuracy model with minimal data requirement. Under different environmental perturbations, each biological system exhibits a unique, structured phenotypic response. This structure can be learned based on limited data and once learned, can constrain subsequent quantitative predictions. We demonstrate that SAR requires significantly fewer data comparing to other existing machine-learning methods to achieve a high prediction accuracy, first on simulated data, then on experimental data of various systems and input dimensions. We then show how a learned structure can guide effective design of new experiments. Our approach has implications for predictive control of biological systems and an integration of machine learning prediction and experimental design.">

The FNO combines pointwise linear and nonlinear operations in physical space with pointwise linear operations in Fourier space, leading to a parameterized map acting between function spaces. Although FNOs formally involve convolutions of functions on a continuum, in practice the computations are performed on a discretized grid, allowing efficient implementation via the FFT. In this paper, the aliasing error that results from such a discretization is quantified and algebraic rates of convergence in terms of the grid resolution are obtained as a function of the regularity of the input. Numerical experiments that validate the theory and describe model stability are performed.">

Most existed works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large. We present the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) solving PDEs in the latent space. In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.">

However, neural representations of distributional regression models, such as the Cox model, have received little attention so far. We close this gap by proposing a framework for distributional regression using inverse flow transformations (DRIFT), which includes neural representations of the aforementioned models. We empirically demonstrate that the neural representations of models in DRIFT can serve as a substitute for their classical statistical counterparts in several applications involving continuous, ordered, time-series, and survival outcomes. We confirm that models in DRIFT empirically match the performance of several statistical methods in terms of estimation of partial effects, prediction, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. DRIFT covers both interpretable statistical models and flexible neural networks opening up new avenues in both statistical modeling and deep learning.">

        <tr id="Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics. Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.">

Utilizing the nonlinear fitting capabilities of neural networks, FNFS-PINNs offer an approach to addressing the complexities of modeling nonlinear free surface flows, broadening the scope for applying PINNs to various wave propagation scenarios. The improved quasi-σ coordinate transformation and dimensionless formulation of the basic equations are adopted to transform the time-dependent computational domain into the stationary one and align variable scale changes across different dimensions, respectively. These innovations, alongside a specialized network structure and a two-stage optimization process, enhance the mathematical formulation of nonlinear water waves and solvability of the model. FNFS-PINNs are evaluated through three scenarios: solitary wave propagation featuring nonlinearity, regular wave propagation under high dispersion, and an inverse problem of nonlinear free surface flow focusing on the back-calculation of an initial state from its later state. These tests demonstrate the capability of FNFS-PINNs to compute the propagation of solitary and regular waves in the vertical two-dimensional scenarios. While focusing on two-dimensional wave propagation, this study lays the groundwork for extending FNFS-PINNs to other free surface flows and highlights their potential in solving inverse problems.">

Leveraging Tensor Train techniques, our approach tackles the curse of dimensionality inherent in space-time methods. Here, we extend this methodology to the nonlinear time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our discretization scheme exhibits a low-rank structure, facilitating translation to tensor-train (TT) format. Nevertheless, controlling the TT-rank across Newton's iterations, needed to deal with the nonlinearity, poses a challenge, leading us to devise the"Step Truncation TT-Newton"method. We demonstrate the exponential convergence of our methods through various benchmark examples.

It then demonstrates that a prediction problem modeled through an RNN, with a specific regularization term in the loss function, can have its first-order conditions expressed analytically. This system of equations is reduced to two matrix equations involving Sylvester equations, which can be partially solved. We establish that, if certain conditions are met, optimal parameters exist, are unique, and can be found through a straightforward algorithm to any desired precision. Also, as the number of neurons grows the conditions of convergence become easier to fulfill. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are also explored by including linear constraints on parameters. According to our model, incorporating loops (with fixed or variable weights) will produce loss functions that train easier, because it assures the existence of a region where an iterative method converges.">

However, theoretical analysis of the relationship between parameter space symmetries and these phenomena is difficult.

We develop two methods, with some provable guarantees, of modifying standard neural networks to reduce parameter space symmetries. With these new methods, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study consisting of multiple tasks aimed at assessing the effect of removing parameter symmetries. Our experiments reveal several interesting observations on the empirical impact of parameter symmetries; for instance, we observe linear mode connectivity between our networks without alignment of weight spaces, and we find that our networks allow for faster and more effective Bayesian neural network training.">

How reliable are the mechanistic insights derived from this procedure? While recent advances in population-level recording technologies have allowed simultaneous recording of up to tens of thousands of neurons, this represents only a tiny fraction of most cortical circuits. Here we show that observing only a subset of neurons in a circuit can create mechanistic mismatches between a simulated teacher network and a data-constrained student, even when the two networks have matching single-unit dynamics. In particular, partial observation of models of low-dimensional cortical dynamics based on functionally feedforward or low-rank connectivity can lead to surrogate models with spurious attractor structure. Our results illustrate the challenges inherent in accurately uncovering neural mechanisms from single-trial data, and suggest the need for new methods of validating data-constrained models for neural dynamics.">

        <tr id="This article presents a detailed examination of the methodology and modeling tools utilized to analyze gas flows in pipelines, rooted in the fundamental principles of gas dynamics. The methodology integrates numerical simulations with modern neural network techniques, particularly focusing on the PINN utilizing the continuous symmetry data inherent in PDEs, which is called the symmetry-enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Network. This innovative approach combines artificial neural networks (ANNs) integrating physical equations, which provide enhanced efficiency and accuracy when modeling various complex processes related to physics with a symmetric and asymmetric nature. The presented mathematical model, based on the system of Euler equations, has been carefully implemented using Python language. Verification with analytical solutions ensures the accuracy and reliability of the computations. In this research, a comparative and comprehensive analysis was carried out comparing the outcomes obtained using the symmetry-enhanced PINN method and those from conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. The analysis highlighted the advantages of the symmetry-enhanced PINN method, which produced smoother pressure and velocity fluctuation profiles while reducing the computation time, demonstrating its capacity as a revolutionary modeling tool. The estimated results derived from this study are of paramount importance for ensuring ongoing energy supply reliability and can also be used to create predictive models related to gas behavior in pipelines. The application of modeling techniques for gas flow simulations has the potential to improve the integrity of our energy infrastructure and utilization of gas resources, contributing to advancing our understanding of symmetry principles in nature. However, it is crucial to emphasize that the effectiveness of such models relies on continuous monitoring and frequent updates to ensure alignment with real-world conditions. This research not only contributes to a deeper understanding of compressible gas flows but also underscores the crucial role of advanced modeling methodologies in the sustainable management of gas resources for both current and future generations. The numerical data covered the physics of the process related to the modeling of high-pressure gas flows in pipelines with regard to density, velocity and pressure, where the PINN model was able to outperform the classical CFD method for velocity by 170% and for pressure by 360%, based on L∞ values.">

We investigate the coupling of different neural network calibration measures with a special focus on the Area Under the Sparsification Error curve (AUSE) metric. We elaborate on the well-known inconsistency in determining optimal calibration using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and we demonstrate similar issues for the AUSE, the Uncertainty Calibration Score (UCS), as well as the Uncertainty Calibration Error (UCE). We conclude that the current methodologies leave a degree of freedom, which prevents a unique model calibration for the homologation of safety-critical functionalities. Furthermore, we propose the AUSE as an indirect measure for the residual uncertainty, which is irreducible for a fixed network architecture and is driven by the stochasticity in the underlying data generation process (aleatoric contribution) as well as the limitation in the hypothesis space (epistemic contribution).">

In this sense, there is a need to find new ways to obtain data in a more economical manner. Thus, in this work we study the application of time series forecasting to fluid dynamics problems, where the aim is to predict the flow dynamics using only past information. We focus our study on models based on deep learning that do not require a high amount of data for training, as this is the problem we are trying to address. Specifically in this work we have tested three autoregressive models where two of them are fully based on deep learning and the other one is a hybrid model that combines modal decomposition with deep learning. We ask these models to generate $200$ time-ahead predictions of two datasets coming from a numerical simulation and experimental measurements, where the latter is characterized by being turbulent. We show how the hybrid model generates more reliable predictions in the experimental case, as it is physics-informed in the sense that the modal decomposition extracts the physics in a way that allows us to predict it.">

        <tr id="Abstract Motivation Systems biology aims to better understand living systems through mathematical modelling of experimental and clinical data. A pervasive challenge in quantitative dynamical modelling is the integration of time series measurements, which often have high variability and low sampling resolution. Approaches are required to utilize such information while consistently handling uncertainties. Results We present BayModTS (Bayesian modelling of time series data), a new FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) workflow for processing and analysing sparse and highly variable time series data. BayModTS consistently transfers uncertainties from data to model predictions, including process knowledge via parameterized models. Further, credible differences in the dynamics of different conditions can be identified by filtering noise. To demonstrate the power and versatility of BayModTS, we applied it to three hepatic datasets gathered from three different species and with different measurement techniques: (i) blood perfusion measurements by magnetic resonance imaging in rat livers after portal vein ligation, (ii) pharmacokinetic time series of different drugs in normal and steatotic mice, and (iii) CT-based volumetric assessment of human liver remnants after clinical liver resection. Availability and implementation The BayModTS codebase is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Systems-Theory-in-Systems-Biology/BayModTS. The repository contains a Python script for the executable BayModTS workflow and a widely applicable SBML (systems biology markup language) model for retarded transient functions.

        <tr id="This paper introduces a groundbreaking multimodal neural network model designed for resolution enhancement, which innovatively leverages inter-diagnostic correlations within a system. Traditional approaches have primarily focused on unimodal enhancement strategies, such as pixel-based image enhancement or heuristic signal interpolation. In contrast, our model employs a novel methodology by harnessing the diagnostic relationships within the physics of fusion plasma. Initially, we establish the correlation among diagnostics within the tokamak. Subsequently, we utilize these correlations to substantially enhance the temporal resolution of the Thomson Scattering (TS) diagnostic, which assesses plasma density and temperature. This enhancement goes beyond simple interpolation, offering a super resolution that preserves the underlying physics inherent in inter-diagnostic correlation. Increasing the resolution of TS from conventional 0.2 kHz to 500 kHz could show the diagnostic capability of capturing the structural evolution of plasma instabilities and the response to external field perturbations, that were challenging with conventional diagnostics. This physics-preserving super-resolution technique may enable the discovery of new physics that were previously undetectable due to resolution limitations or allow for the experimental verification of phenomena that had only been predicted through computationally intensive simulations.">

        <tr id="Deep-Learning-based Variational Monte Carlo (DL-VMC) has recently emerged as a highly accurate approach for finding approximate solutions to the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation. Despite its favorable scaling with the number of electrons, $\mathcal{O}(n_\text{el}^{4})$, the practical value of DL-VMC is limited by the high cost of optimizing the neural network weights for every system studied. To mitigate this problem, recent research has proposed optimizing a single neural network across multiple systems, reducing the cost per system. Here we extend this approach to solids, where similar but distinct calculations using different geometries, boundary conditions, and supercell sizes are often required. We show how to optimize a single ansatz across all of these variations, reducing the required number of optimization steps by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we exploit the transfer capabilities of a pre-trained network. We successfully transfer a network, pre-trained on 2x2x2 supercells of LiH, to 3x3x3 supercells. This reduces the number of optimization steps required to simulate the large system by a factor of 50 compared to previous work.">

        <tr id="Field inversion machine learning (FIML) has the advantages of model consistency and low data dependency and has been used to augment imperfect turbulence models. However, the solver-intrusive field inversion has a high entry bar, and existing FIML studies focused on improving only steady-state or time-averaged periodic flow predictions. To break this limit, this paper develops an open-source FIML framework for time-accurate unsteady flow, where both spatial and temporal variations of flow are of interest. We augment a Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence model's production term with a scalar field. We then integrate a neural network (NN) model into the flow solver to compute the above augmentation scalar field based on local flow features at each time step. Finally, we optimize the weights and biases of the built-in NN model to minimize the regulated spatial-temporal prediction error between the augmented flow solver and reference data. We consider the spatial-temporal evolution of unsteady flow over a 45° ramp and use only the surface pressure as the training data. The unsteady-FIML-trained model accurately predicts the spatial-temporal variations of unsteady flow fields. In addition, the trained model exhibits reasonably good prediction accuracy for various ramp angles, Reynolds numbers, and flow variables (e.g., velocity fields) that are not used in training, highlighting its generalizability. The FIML capability has been integrated into our open-source framework DAFoam. It has the potential to train more accurate RANS turbulence models for other unsteady flow phenomena, such as wind gust response, bubbly flow, and particle dispersion in the atmosphere.">

The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in (Qu et.al, 2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.">

        <tr id="Mesoscale eddies are of utmost importance in understanding ocean dynamics and the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients. Accurate representation of these eddies in ocean models is essential for improving model predictions. However, accurately representing these mesoscale features in numerical models is challenging due to their relatively small size. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines data-driven techniques with physical principles to develop a robust and interpretable parameterization scheme for mesoscale eddies in ocean modeling. We first analyze a high-resolution reanalysis dataset to extract subgrid eddy momentum and use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations. To ensure physical consistency, we have introduced conservation of momentum constraints in our CNN parameterization scheme through soft and hard constraints. The interpretability analysis illustrate that the pre-trained CNN parameterization shows promising results in accurately solving the resolved mean velocity at the local scale and effectively capturing the representation of unresolved subgrid turbulence processes at the global scale. Furthermore, to validate the CNN parameterization scheme offline, we conduct simulations using the MITgcm ocean model. A series of experiments is conducted to compare the performance of the model with the CNN parameterization scheme and high-resolution simulations. The offline validation using MITgcm simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the CNN parameterization scheme in improving the representation of mesoscale eddies in the ocean model. Incorporating the CNN parameterization scheme leads to better agreement with high-resolution simulations and a more accurate representation of the kinetic energy spectra.">

 Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (GMABs) are retirement savings vehicles that protect the policyholder against downside market risk. This article proposes a valuation method for these contracts based on physics-inspired neural networks (PINNs), in the presence of multiple financial and biometric risk factors. A PINN integrates principles from physics into its learning process to enhance its efficiency in solving complex problems. In this article, the driving principle is the Feynman–Kac (FK) equation, which is a partial differential equation (PDE) governing the GMAB price in an arbitrage-free market. In our context, the FK PDE depends on multiple variables and is difficult to solve using classical finite difference approximations. In comparison, PINNs constitute an efficient alternative that can evaluate GMABs with various specifications without the need for retraining. To illustrate this, we consider a market with four risk factors. We first derive a closed-form expression for the GMAB that serves as a benchmark for the PINN. Next, we propose a scaled version of the FK equation that we solve using a PINN. Pricing errors are analyzed in a numerical illustration.">

Learning to manipulate granular materials based on physical information obtained through precise modelling remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by constructing a differentiable physics simulator for granular materials based on the Taichi programming language and developing a learning framework accelerated by imperfect demonstrations that are generated via gradient-based optimisation on non-granular materials through our simulator. Experimental results show that our method trains three policies that, when chained, are capable of executing the task of transporting granular materials in both simulated and real-world scenarios, which existing popular deep reinforcement learning models fail to accomplish.">

        <tr id="In the field of dissipative systems, the non-Hermitian skin effect has generated significant interest due to its unexpected implications. A system is said to exhibit a skin effect if its properties are largely affected by the boundary conditions. Despite the burgeoning interest, the potential impact of this phenomenon on emerging quantum technologies remains unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by demonstrating that quantum neural networks can exhibit this behavior and that skin effects, beyond their fundamental interest, can also be exploited in computational tasks. Specifically, we show that the performance of a given complex network used as a quantum reservoir computer is dictated solely by the boundary conditions of a dissipative line within its architecture. The closure of one (edge) link is found to drastically change the performance in time series processing proving the possibility to exploit skin effects for machine learning.">

We derive estimates for the parametric regularity of multivariate double integration problems over high-dimensional parameter and data domains arising in Bayesian optimal design problems. We provide a detailed analysis for these double integration problems using two approaches: a full tensor product and a sparse tensor product combination of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) cubature rules over the parameter and data domains. Specifically, we show that the latter approach significantly improves the convergence rate, exhibiting performance comparable to that of QMC integration of a single high-dimensional integral. Furthermore, we numerically verify the predicted convergence rates for an elliptic PDE problem with an unknown diffusion coefficient in two spatial dimensions, offering empirical evidence supporting the theoretical results and highlighting practical applicability.">

        <tr id="Developing physical closure models with explicit expressions based on a given dataset is essential to science and engineering. For such symbolic regression tasks, biology-inspired evolutionary algorithms are most widely used. However, typical evolutionary algorithms do not utilize any structural information inherent in training data, which limits their performance in finding accurate model structures and coefficients. By combining one evolutionary algorithm, gene expression programing (GEP), with an artificial neural network (ANN) for symbolic regression, we propose a novel evolutionary neural network method, in which candidate expressions are specifically designed so that they can be transformed between the GEP and ANN structures during training iterations. By combining the GEP's global searching and the ANN's gradient optimization capabilities, efficient and robust convergence to accurate models can be achieved. In addition, sparsity-enhancing strategies have been introduced to improve the interpretability of the trained models. The present method has been tested for finding different physical laws and then applied to turbulence modeling problems with different configurations, showing advantages compared to the existing GEP and ANN methods.">

        <tr id="We introduce Poseidon, a foundation model for learning the solution operators of PDEs. It is based on a multiscale operator transformer, with time-conditioned layer norms that enable continuous-in-time evaluations. A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is then evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results showcase the surprising ability of Poseidon to learn effective representations from a very small set of PDEs during pretraining in order to generalize well to unseen and unrelated PDEs downstream, demonstrating its potential as an effective, general purpose PDE foundation model. Finally, the Poseidon model as well as underlying pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced, with code being available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/poseidon and pretrained models and datasets at https://huggingface.co/camlab-ethz.">

        <tr id="Loss function plays a vital role in supervised learning frameworks. The selection of the appropriate loss function holds the potential to have a substantial impact on the proficiency attained by the acquired model. The training of supervised learning algorithms inherently adheres to predetermined loss functions during the optimization process. In this paper, we present a novel contribution to the realm of supervised machine learning: an asymmetric loss function named wave loss. It exhibits robustness against outliers, insensitivity to noise, boundedness, and a crucial smoothness property. Theoretically, we establish that the proposed wave loss function manifests the essential characteristic of being classification-calibrated. Leveraging this breakthrough, we incorporate the proposed wave loss function into the least squares setting of support vector machines (SVM) and twin support vector machines (TSVM), resulting in two robust and smooth models termed Wave-SVM and Wave-TSVM, respectively. To address the optimization problem inherent in Wave-SVM, we utilize the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm. It is noteworthy that this paper marks the first instance of the Adam algorithm application to solve an SVM model. Further, we devise an iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problems of Wave-TSVM. To empirically showcase the effectiveness of the proposed Wave-SVM and Wave-TSVM, we evaluate them on benchmark UCI and KEEL datasets (with and without feature noise) from diverse domains. Moreover, to exemplify the applicability of Wave-SVM in the biomedical domain, we evaluate it on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The experimental outcomes unequivocally reveal the prowess of Wave-SVM and Wave-TSVM in achieving superior prediction accuracy against the baseline models.">

Due to the overwhelming complexity of human biology, machine learning approaches that leverage large datasets of historical patients' longitudinal health records to generate patients' digital twins are more tractable than potential mechanistic models. In this manuscript, we describe a neural network architecture that can learn conditional generative models of clinical trajectories, which we call Digital Twin Generators (DTGs), that can create digital twins of individual patients. We show that the same neural network architecture can be trained to generate accurate digital twins for patients across 13 different indications simply by changing the training set and tuning hyperparameters. By introducing a general purpose architecture, we aim to unlock the ability to scale machine learning approaches to larger datasets and across more indications so that a digital twin could be created for any patient in the world.">

        <tr id="The stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model considered here is a two-dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential equation with additive degenerate noise, whose first component, the only one observed, describes the membrane voltage evolution of a single neuron. Due to its low dimensionality, its analytical and numerical tractability, and its neuronal interpretation, it has been used as a case study to test the performance of different statistical methods in estimating the underlying model parameters. Existing methods, however, often require complete observations, non-degeneracy of the noise or a complex architecture (e.g., to estimate the transition density of the process,"recovering"the unobserved second component), and they may not (satisfactorily) estimate all model parameters simultaneously. Moreover, these studies lack real data applications for the stochastic FHN model. Here, we tackle all challenges (non-globally Lipschitz drift, non-explicit solution, lack of available transition density, degeneracy of the noise, and partial observations) via an intuitive and easy-to-implement sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm. The proposed method relies on a recent computationally efficient and structure-preserving numerical splitting scheme for synthetic data generation, and on summary statistics exploiting the structural properties of the process. We succeed in estimating all model parameters from simulated data and, more remarkably, real action potential data of rats. The presented novel real-data fit may broaden the scope and credibility of this classic and widely used neuronal model.">

In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved flexibility and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the calculation of the contrast variation into each of the subnetworks, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, which guarantees the physical interpretability of variables of the subnetworks. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.">
