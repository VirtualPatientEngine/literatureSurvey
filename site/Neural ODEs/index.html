        <tr id="We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.">

        <tr id="Continuous deep learning architectures have recently re-emerged as variants of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). The infinite-depth approach offered by these models theoretically bridges the gap between deep learning and dynamical systems; however, deciphering their inner working is still an open challenge and most of their applications are currently limited to the inclusion as generic black-box modules. In this work, we "open the box" and offer a system-theoretic perspective, including state augmentation strategies and robustness, with the aim of clarifying the influence of several design choices on the underlying dynamics. We also introduce novel architectures: among them, a Galerkin-inspired depth-varying parameter model and neural ODEs with data-controlled vector fields.">

        <tr id="We introduce the framework of continuous--depth graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph neural ordinary differential equations (GDEs) are formalized as the counterpart to GNNs where the input-output relationship is determined by a continuum of GNN layers, blending discrete topological structures and differential equations. The proposed framework is shown to be compatible with various static and autoregressive GNN models. Results prove general effectiveness of GDEs: in static settings they offer computational advantages by incorporating numerical methods in their forward pass; in dynamic settings, on the other hand, they are shown to improve performance by exploiting the geometry of the underlying dynamics.">

        <tr id="We present Graph Neural Diffusion (GRAND) that approaches deep learning on graphs as a continuous diffusion process and treats Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as discretisations of an underlying PDE. In our model, the layer structure and topology correspond to the discretisation choices of temporal and spatial operators. Our approach allows a principled development of a broad new class of GNNs that are able to address the common plights of graph learning models such as depth, oversmoothing, and bottlenecks. Key to the success of our models are stability with respect to perturbations in the data and this is addressed for both implicit and explicit discretisation schemes. We develop linear and nonlinear versions of GRAND, which achieve competitive results on many standard graph benchmarks.">

        <tr id="We propose Graph-Coupled Oscillator Networks (GraphCON), a novel framework for deep learning on graphs. It is based on discretizations of a second-order system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which model a network of nonlinear controlled and damped oscillators, coupled via the adjacency structure of the underlying graph. The flexibility of our framework permits any basic GNN layer (e.g. convolutional or attentional) as the coupling function, from which a multi-layer deep neural network is built up via the dynamics of the proposed ODEs. We relate the oversmoothing problem, commonly encountered in GNNs, to the stability of steady states of the underlying ODE and show that zero-Dirichlet energy steady states are not stable for our proposed ODEs. This demonstrates that the proposed framework mitigates the oversmoothing problem. Moreover, we prove that GraphCON mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem to facilitate training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Finally, we show that our approach offers competitive performance with respect to the state-of-the-art on a variety of graph-based learning tasks.">

        <tr id="The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is difficult, having led to a century of research so far. Recently, there have been pushes to build neural--numerical hybrid solvers, which piggy-backs the modern trend towards fully end-to-end learned systems. Most works so far can only generalize over a subset of properties to which a generic solver would be faced, including: resolution, topology, geometry, boundary conditions, domain discretization regularity, dimensionality, etc. In this work, we build a solver, satisfying these properties, where all the components are based on neural message passing, replacing all heuristically designed components in the computation graph with backprop-optimized neural function approximators. We show that neural message passing solvers representationally contain some classical methods, such as finite differences, finite volumes, and WENO schemes. In order to encourage stability in training autoregressive models, we put forward a method that is based on the principle of zero-stability, posing stability as a domain adaptation problem. We validate our method on various fluid-like flow problems, demonstrating fast, stable, and accurate performance across different domain topologies, equation parameters, discretizations, etc., in 1D and 2D.">

        <tr id="Effective data-driven PDE forecasting methods often rely on fixed spatial and / or temporal discretizations. This raises limitations in real-world applications like weather prediction where flexible extrapolation at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations is required. We address this problem by introducing a new data-driven approach, DINo, that models a PDE's flow with continuous-time dynamics of spatially continuous functions. This is achieved by embedding spatial observations independently of their discretization via Implicit Neural Representations in a small latent space temporally driven by a learned ODE. This separate and flexible treatment of time and space makes DINo the first data-driven model to combine the following advantages. It extrapolates at arbitrary spatial and temporal locations; it can learn from sparse irregular grids or manifolds; at test time, it generalizes to new grids or resolutions. DINo outperforms alternative neural PDE forecasters in a variety of challenging generalization scenarios on representative PDE systems.">

        <tr id="We consider using deep neural networks to solve time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), where multi-scale processing is crucial for modeling complex, time-evolving dynamics. While the U-Net architecture with skip connections is commonly used by prior studies to enable multi-scale processing, our analysis shows that the need for features to evolve across layers results in temporally misaligned features in skip connections, which limits the model's performance. To address this limitation, we propose SineNet, consisting of multiple sequentially connected U-shaped network blocks, referred to as waves. In SineNet, high-resolution features are evolved progressively through multiple stages, thereby reducing the amount of misalignment within each stage. We furthermore analyze the role of skip connections in enabling both parallel and sequential processing of multi-scale information. Our method is rigorously tested on multiple PDE datasets, including the Navier-Stokes equations and shallow water equations, showcasing the advantages of our proposed approach over conventional U-Nets with a comparable parameter budget. We further demonstrate that increasing the number of waves in SineNet while maintaining the same number of parameters leads to a monotonically improved performance. The results highlight the effectiveness of SineNet and the potential of our approach in advancing the state-of-the-art in neural PDE solver design.

        <tr id="Neural solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have great potential, yet their practicality is currently limited by their generalizability. PDEs evolve over broad scales and exhibit diverse behaviors; predicting these phenomena will require learning representations across a wide variety of inputs, which may encompass different coefficients, geometries, or equations. As a step towards generalizable PDE modeling, we adapt masked pretraining for PDEs. Through self-supervised learning across PDEs, masked autoencoders can learn useful latent representations for downstream tasks. In particular, masked pretraining can improve coefficient regression and timestepping performance of neural solvers on unseen equations. We hope that masked pretraining can emerge as a unifying method across large, unlabeled, and heterogeneous datasets to learn latent physics at scale.">

        <tr id="Dynamics of many complex systems, from weather and climate to spread of infectious diseases, can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Such PDEs involve unknown function(s), partial derivatives, and typically multiple independent variables. The traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs assume that the data are observed on a regular grid. However, in many applications, for example, weather and air pollution monitoring delivered by the arbitrary located weather stations of the National Weather Services, data records are irregularly spaced. Furthermore, in problems involving prediction analytics such as forecasting wildfire smoke plumes, the primary focus may be on a set of irregular locations associated with urban development. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods and, in particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a new promising tool that can complement traditional PDE solvers in scenarios of the irregular spaced data, contributing to the newest research trend of physics informed machine learning (PIML). However, most existing PIML methods tend to be limited in their ability to describe higher dimensional structural properties exhibited by real world phenomena, especially, ones that live on manifolds. To address this fundamental challenge, we bring the elements of the Hodge theory and, in particular, simplicial convolution defined on the Hodge Laplacian to the emerging nexus of DL and PDEs. In contrast to conventional Laplacian and the associated convolution operation, the simplicial convolution allows us to rigorously describe diffusion across higher order structures and to better approximate the complex underlying topology and geometry of the data. The new approach, Simplicial Neural Networks for Partial Differential Equations (SNN PDE) offers a computationally efficient yet effective solution for time dependent PDEs. Our studies of a broad range of synthetic data and wildfire processes demonstrate that SNN PDE improves upon state of the art baselines in handling unstructured grids and irregular time intervals of complex physical systems and offers competitive forecasting capabilities for weather and air quality forecasting.">

Deep learning approaches, such as transformers, have recently challenged the simulation paradigm with complex network forecasts. However, they often act as data-driven black-box models that neglect the underlying physics and lack uncertainty quantification. We address these limitations with ClimODE, a spatiotemporal continuous-time process that implements a key principle of advection from statistical mechanics, namely, weather changes due to a spatial movement of quantities over time. ClimODE models precise weather evolution with value-conserving dynamics, learning global weather transport as a neural flow, which also enables estimating the uncertainty in predictions. Our approach outperforms existing data-driven methods in global and regional forecasting with an order of magnitude smaller parameterization, establishing a new state of the art.">

        <tr id="Neural Ordinary Differential Equations typically struggle to generalize to new dynamical behaviors created by parameter changes in the underlying system, even when the dynamics are close to previously seen behaviors. The issue gets worse when the changing parameters are unobserved, i.e., their value or influence is not directly measurable when collecting data. We introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a framework that encodes said unobserved parameters in a latent context vector as input to a vector field. NCFs leverage differentiability of the vector field with respect to the parameters, along with first-order Taylor expansion to allow any context vector to influence trajectories from other parameters. We validate our method and compare it to established Multi-Task and Meta-Learning alternatives, showing competitive performance in mean squared error for in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluation on the Lotka-Volterra, Glycolytic Oscillator, and Gray-Scott problems.

        <tr id="Discovering a suitable neural network architecture for modeling complex dynamical systems poses a formidable challenge, often involving extensive trial and error and navigation through a high-dimensional hyper-parameter space. In this paper, we discuss a systematic approach to constructing neural architectures for modeling a subclass of dynamical systems, namely, Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. We use a variant of continuous-time neural networks in which the output of each neuron evolves continuously as a solution of a first-order or second-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Instead of deriving the network architecture and parameters from data, we propose a gradient-free algorithm to compute sparse architecture and network parameters directly from the given LTI system, leveraging its properties. We bring forth a novel neural architecture paradigm featuring horizontal hidden layers and provide insights into why employing conventional neural architectures with vertical hidden layers may not be favorable. We also provide an upper bound on the numerical errors of our neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the high accuracy of our constructed networks on three numerical examples.">

In the high-resolution space, a NeuralPDE-class model predicts the system's state at future timepoints using differentiable ODE solvers and fully convolutional neural networks parametrizing the system's dynamics. We empirically evaluate GrINd on the DynaBench benchmark dataset, comprising six different physical systems observed at scattered locations, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance compared to existing models.

        <tr id="Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learn- ing models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irreg- ular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based mod- els, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experi- ments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.">

To this end, we propose GRADE inspired by graph aggregation-diffusion equations, which includes the delicate balance between nonlinear diffusion and aggregation induced by interaction potentials. The node representations obtained through aggregation-diffusion equations exhibit metastability, indicating that features can aggregate into multiple clusters. In addition, the dynamics within these clusters can persist for long time periods, offering the potential to alleviate over-smoothing effects. This nonlinear diffusion in our model generalizes existing diffusion-based models and establishes a connection with classical GNNs.

The main idea of PGCAN is to parameterize the input space with a grid-based encoder whose parameters are connected to the output via a DNN decoder that leverages attention to prioritize feature training. Our encoder provides a localized learning ability and uses convolution layers to avoid overfitting and improve information propagation rate from the boundaries to the interior of the domain. We test the performance of PGCAN on a wide range of PDE systems and show that it effectively addresses spectral bias and provides more accurate solutions compared to competing methods.">

Based on the Liouville equation associated with the stochastic dynamical systems, a new temporal KRnet (tKRnet) is proposed to approximate the probability density functions (PDFs) of the state variables. The tKRnet gives an explicit density model for the solution of the Liouville equation, which alleviates the curse of dimensionality issue that limits the application of traditional grid based numerical methods. To efficiently train the tKRnet, an adaptive procedure is developed to generate collocation points for the corresponding residual loss function, where samples are generated iteratively using the approximate density function at each iteration. A temporal decomposition technique is also employed to improve the long-time integration. Theoretical analysis of our proposed method is provided, and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate its performance.">

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called"seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.">

Yet, this process can be prohibitively expensive, owing to the inherent complexities of the problems, including nonlinearity and multiscale phenomena.

In this paper, we propose a novel Physics-Guided Diffusion Model (PGDM) for downscaling. Our model, initially trained on a dataset comprising low-and-high-fidelity paired solutions across coarse and fine scales, generates new high-fidelity approximations from any new low-fidelity inputs. These outputs are subsequently refined through fine-tuning, aimed at minimizing the physical discrepancies as defined by the discretized PDEs at the finer scale. We evaluate and benchmark our model's performance against other downscaling baselines in three categories of nonlinear PDEs. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model not only outperforms the baselines but also achieves a computational acceleration exceeding tenfold, while maintaining the same level of accuracy as the conventional fine-scale solvers.">

Data-driven approaches based on machine learning models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to numerical weather prediction models given their potential to capture physics of different scales from historical data and the significantly lower computational cost during the prediction stage. Renowned for its state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, the Transformer model has also gained popularity in machine learning weather prediction. Yet applying Transformer architectures to weather forecasting, particularly on a global scale is computationally challenging due to the quadratic complexity of attention and the quadratic increase in spatial points as resolution increases. In this work, we propose a factorized-attention-based model tailored for spherical geometries to mitigate this issue. More specifically, it utilizes multi-dimensional factorized kernels that convolve over different axes where the computational complexity of the kernel is only quadratic to the axial resolution instead of overall resolution. The deterministic forecasting accuracy of the proposed model on $1.5^\circ$ and 0-7 days' lead time is on par with state-of-the-art purely data-driven machine learning weather prediction models. We also showcase the proposed model holds great potential to push forward the Pareto front of accuracy-efficiency for Transformer weather models, where it can achieve better accuracy with less computational cost compared to Transformer based models with standard attention.">

Machine learning methods for solving the Allen-Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives through automatic differentiation, and the large system size required by the space-time approach. To overcome these limitations, we propose a separable neural network-based approximation of the phase field in a minimizing movement scheme to solve the aforementioned gradient flow problem. At each time step, the separable neural network is used to approximate the phase field in space through a low-rank tensor decomposition thereby accelerating the derivative calculations. The minimizing movement scheme naturally allows for the use of Gauss quadrature technique to compute the functional. A `$tanh$' transformation is applied on the neural network-predicted phase field to strictly bounds the solutions within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, a theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that bounding the solution through this transformation is the key to effectively model sharp interfaces through separable neural network. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for phase separation problems and is an order of magnitude faster than the finite element method.">

        <tr id="Transport phenomena (e.g., fluid flows) are governed by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) describing mass, momentum, and energy conservation, and are ubiquitous in many engineering applications. However, deep learning architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the simulation of these PDEs. This paper clearly articulates and then solves this incompatibility. The local-dependency of generic transport PDEs implies that it only involves local information to predict the physical properties at a location in the next time step. However, the deep learning architecture will inevitably increase the scope of information to make such predictions as the number of layers increases, which can cause sluggish convergence and compromise generalizability. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a distributed data scoping method with linear time complexity to strictly limit the scope of information to predict the local properties. The numerical experiments over multiple physics show that our data scoping method significantly accelerates training convergence and improves the generalizability of benchmark models on large-scale engineering simulations. Specifically, over the geometries not included in the training data for heat transferring simulation, it can increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 21.7 \% and that of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by 38.5 \% on average.">

This ultimately results in the failure of optimization that is based on gradient descent in the training process. Relaxation systems provide a smooth asymptotic to the discontinuity solution, under the expectation that macroscopic problems can be solved from a microscopic perspective. Based on relaxation systems, the RelaxNN framework alleviates the conflict of losses in the training process of the PINN framework.

This method effectively addresses elliptic PDEs on irregular domains, including the modified Helmholtz, Stokes, and elasticity equations. The rapid evolution of neural networks and deep learning has invigorated the exploration of numerical PDEs. An increasing interest is observed in deep learning approaches that seamlessly integrate mathematical principles for investigating numerical PDEs. We propose a hybrid KFBI method, integrating the foundational principles of the KFBI method with the capabilities of deep learning. This approach, within the framework of the boundary integral method, designs a network to approximate the solution operator for the corresponding integral equations by mapping the parameters, inhomogeneous terms and boundary information of PDEs to the boundary density functions, which can be regarded as the solution of the integral equations. The models are trained using data generated by the Cartesian grid-based KFBI algorithm, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. It accurately predicts density functions across diverse boundary conditions and parameters within the same class of equations. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained model can directly infer the boundary density function with satisfactory precision, obviating the need for iterative steps in solving boundary integral equations. Furthermore, applying the inference results of the model as initial values for iterations is also reasonable; this approach can retain the inherent second-order accuracy of the KFBI method while accelerating the traditional KFBI approach by reducing about 50% iterations.">

Even current popular neural network algorithms or deep learning methods cannot guarantee yielding large interval solutions for these problems. In this paper, we propose a piecewise neural network approach to obtain a large interval numerical solution for initial value problems of differential equations. In this method, we first divide the solution interval, on which the initial problem is to be solved, into several smaller intervals. Neural networks with a unified structure are then employed on each sub-interval to solve the related sub-problems. By assembling these neural network solutions, a piecewise expression of the large interval solution to the problem is constructed, referred to as the piecewise neural network solution. The continuous differentiability of the solution over the entire interval, except for finite points, is proven through theoretical analysis and employing a parameter transfer technique. Additionally, a parameter transfer and multiple rounds of pre-training technique are utilized to enhance the accuracy of the approximation solution. Compared with existing neural network algorithms, this method does not increase the network size and training data scale for training the network on each sub-domain. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.">

However, they often fail to achieve the same level of accuracy as classical methods in solving differential equations. In this paper, we identify two sources of this issue in the case of Cauchy problems: the use of $L^2$ residuals as objective functions and the approximation gap of neural networks. We show that minimizing the sum of $L^2$ residual and initial condition error is not sufficient to guarantee the true solution, as this loss function does not capture the underlying dynamics. Additionally, neural networks are not capable of capturing singularities in the solutions due to the non-compactness of their image sets. This, in turn, influences the existence of global minima and the regularity of the network. We demonstrate that when the global minimum does not exist, machine precision becomes the predominant source of achievable error in practice. We also present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.">

        <tr id="Besides classical feed-forward neural networks, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated to a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps a linear transformation of the input to a linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points. These properties can be characterized via Morse functions, which are scalar functions, where every critical point is non-degenerate. We prove that critical points cannot exist, if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that each critical point is non-degenerate, if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and in the infinite depth case. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding, i.e.\ on the exact representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs. Our dynamical systems viewpoint on the geometric structure of the input-output map provides a fundamental understanding, why certain architectures perform better than others.">

To overcome this challenge, in this paper, leveraging the score-based generative diffusion model, we introduce a novel unsupervised inversion methodology tailored for solving inverse problems arising from PDEs. Our approach operates within the Bayesian inversion framework, treating the task of solving the posterior distribution as a conditional generation process achieved through solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of inversion results, we propose an ODE-based Diffusion Posterior Sampling inversion algorithm.

This method's integration of parametric space information significantly reduces the need for training data to effectively predict high-fidelity solutions from low-fidelity ones. In this study, we examine a two-dimensional steady-state heat transfer analysis within a highly heterogeneous materials microstructure. The heat conductivity coefficients for two different materials are condensed from a 101 x 101 grid to smaller grids. We then solve the boundary value problem on the coarsest grid using a pre-trained physics-informed neural operator network known as Finite Operator Learning (FOL). The resulting low-fidelity solution is subsequently upscaled back to a 101 x 101 grid using a newly designed enhanced autoencoder. The novelty of the developed enhanced autoencoder lies in the concatenation of heat conductivity maps of different resolutions to the decoder segment in distinct steps. Hence the developed algorithm is named microstructure-embedded autoencoder (MEA). We compare the MEA outcomes with those from finite element methods, the standard U-Net, and various other upscaling techniques, including interpolation functions and feedforward neural networks (FFNN). Our analysis shows that MEA outperforms these methods in terms of computational efficiency and error on test cases. As a result, the MEA serves as a potential supplement to neural operator networks, effectively upscaling low-fidelity solutions to high fidelity while preserving critical details often lost in traditional upscaling methods, particularly at sharp interfaces like those seen with interpolation.">

However, as the dimension increases, the relationship and interaction between variables become more complex, and existing methods are difficult to provide fast and interpretable solutions for high-dimensional PDEs. To address this issue, we propose a genetic programming symbolic regression algorithm based on transfer learning and automatic differentiation to solve PDEs. This method uses genetic programming to search for a mathematically understandable expression and combines automatic differentiation to determine whether the search result satisfies the PDE and boundary conditions to be solved. To overcome the problem of slow solution speed caused by large search space, we propose a transfer learning mechanism that transfers the structure of one-dimensional PDE analytical solution to the form of high-dimensional PDE solution. We tested three representative types of PDEs, and the results showed that our proposed method can obtain reliable and human-understandable real solutions or algebraic equivalent solutions of PDEs, and the convergence speed is better than the compared methods.

When the gradient is embedded in an optimization routine, the quantity of interest can be optimized for the system to have the desired behaviour. Adjoint methods require the system's Jacobian, whose computation can be cumbersome, and is problem dependent. We propose a computational strategy to infer the adjoint sensitivities from data (observables), which bypasses the need of the Jacobian of the physical system. The key component of this strategy is an echo state network, which learns the dynamics of nonlinear regimes with varying parameters, and evolves dynamically via a hidden state. Although the framework is general, we focus on thermoacoustics governed by nonlinear and time-delayed systems. First, we show that a parameter-aware Echo State Network (ESN) infers the parameterized dynamics. Second, we derive the adjoint of the ESN to compute the sensitivity of time-averaged cost functionals. Third, we propose the Thermoacoustic Echo State Network (T-ESN), which hard constrains the physical knowledge in the network architecture. Fourth, we apply the framework to a variety of nonlinear thermoacoustic regimes of a prototypical system. We show that the T-ESN accurately infers the correct adjoint sensitivities of the time-averaged acoustic energy with respect to the flame parameters. The results are robust to noisy data, from periodic, through quasiperiodic, to chaotic regimes. A single network predicts the nonlinear bifurcations on unseen scenarios, and so the inferred adjoint sensitivities are employed to suppress an instability via steepest descent. This work opens new possibilities for gradient-based data-driven design optimization.">

        <tr id="The scientific machine learning (SciML) field has introduced a new class of models called physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). These models incorporate domain-specific knowledge as soft constraints on a loss function and use machine learning techniques to train the model. Although PINN models have shown promising results for simple problems, they are prone to failure when moderate level of complexities are added to the problems. We demonstrate that the existing baseline models, in particular PINN and evolutionary sampling (Evo), are unable to capture the solution to differential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators when the imposed initial condition is non-trivial. We then propose a promising solution to address these types of failure modes. This approach involves coupling Curriculum learning with the baseline models, where the network first trains on PDEs with simple initial conditions and is progressively exposed to more complex initial conditions. Our results show that we can reduce the error by 1 – 2 orders of magnitude with our proposed method compared to regular PINN and Evo.">

SST is strongly affected by fine balances between forces and becomes more anisotropic in time for decaying cases. Moreover, there is a limited understanding of the physical phenomena described by some of the terms in the URANS equations. Rather than attempting to model each term separately, it is attractive to explore the capability of machine learning to model groups of terms, i.e., to directly model the force balances. We consider decaying SST which are homogeneous and stably stratified by a uniform density gradient, enabling dimensionality reduction. We consider two time-series ML models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE). Both models perform accurately and are numerically stable in a posteriori tests. Furthermore, we explore the data requirements of the ML models by extracting physically relevant timescales of the complex system. We find that the ratio of the timescales of the minimum information required by the ML models to accurately capture the dynamics of the SST corresponds to the Reynolds number of the flow. The current framework provides the backbone to explore the capability of such models to capture the dynamics of higher-dimensional complex SST flows.">

In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), to investigate and explore the solution of the generalized non-linear sine-Gordon equation, encompassing Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. To incorporate physical information for the sine-Gordon equation, a multiobjective loss function has been defined consisting of the residual of governing partial differential equation (PDE), initial conditions, and various boundary conditions. Using multiple densely connected independent artificial neural networks (ANNs), called feedforward deep neural networks designed to handle partial differential equations, PINNs have been trained through automatic differentiation to minimize a loss function that incorporates the given PDE that governs the physical laws of phenomena. To illustrate the effectiveness, validity, and practical implications of our proposed approach, two computational examples from the nonlinear sine-Gordon are presented. We have developed a PINN algorithm and implemented it using Python software. Various experiments were conducted to determine an optimal neural architecture. The network training was employed by using the current state-of-the-art optimization methods in machine learning known as Adam and L-BFGS-B minimization techniques. Additionally, the solutions from the proposed method are compared with the established analytical solutions found in the literature. The findings show that the proposed method is a computational machine learning approach that is accurate and efficient for solving nonlinear sine-Gordon equations with a variety of boundary conditions as well as any complex nonlinear physical problems across multiple disciplines.">

Neural operators are neural networks that learn a mapping from the parameter space to the solution space of PDEs from data, and they can also solve the inverse problem of estimating the parameter from the solution. Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

For this purpose, neural forms have been introduced, i.e., functional expressions that depend on neural networks which, by design, satisfy the prescribed conditions exactly.

Second, it outlines a method for establishing an upper bound on the absolute deviation from the exact solution. Third, it introduces a technique for converting problems with Neumann or Robin conditions into equivalent problems with parametric Dirichlet conditions. The proposed optimized neural forms were numerically tested on a set of diverse problems, encompassing first-order and second-order ordinary differential equations, as well as first-order systems. Stiff and delay differential equations were also considered. The obtained solutions were compared against solutions obtained via Runge-Kutta methods and exact solutions wherever available. The reported results and analysis verify that in addition to the exact satisfaction of the boundary or initial conditions, optimized neural forms provide closed-form solutions of superior interpolation capability and controllable overall accuracy.">

First, we deploy a parameter-aware echo state network (ESN) to accurately forecast and simulate the dynamics of a dynamical system for a range of system's parameters. Second, we derive the adjoint of the parameter-aware ESN. Finally, we combine the parameter-aware ESN with its adjoint version to compute the sensitivities to the system parameters. We showcase the method on a prototypical chaotic system. Because adjoint sensitivities in chaotic regimes diverge for long integration times, we analyse the application of ensemble adjoint method to the ESN. We find that the adjoint sensitivities obtained from the ESN match closely with the original system. This work opens possibilities for sensitivity analysis without code-specific adjoint solvers.">

        <tr id="The residual loss in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) alters the simple recursive relation of layers in a feed-forward neural network by applying a differential operator, resulting in a loss landscape that is inherently different from those of common supervised problems. Therefore, relying on the existing theory leads to unjustified design choices and suboptimal performance. In this work, we analyze the residual loss by studying its characteristics at critical points to find the conditions that result in effective training of PINNs. Specifically, we first show that under certain conditions, the residual loss of PINNs can be globally minimized by a wide neural network. Furthermore, our analysis also reveals that an activation function with well-behaved high-order derivatives plays a crucial role in minimizing the residual loss. In particular, to solve a $k$-th order PDE, the $k$-th derivative of the activation function should be bijective. The established theory paves the way for designing and choosing effective activation functions for PINNs and explains why periodic activations have shown promising performance in certain cases. Finally, we verify our findings by conducting a set of experiments on several PDEs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nimahsn/pinns_tf2.">

        <tr id="Oversmoothing is a commonly observed challenge in graph neural network (GNN) learning, where, as layers increase, embedding features learned from GNNs quickly become similar/indistinguishable, making them incapable of differentiating network proximity. A GNN with shallow layer architectures can only learn short-term relation or localized structure information, limiting its power of learning long-term connection, evidenced by their inferior learning performance on heterophilous graphs. Tackling oversmoothing is crucial to harness deep-layer architectures for GNNs. To date, many methods have been proposed to alleviate oversmoothing. The vast difference behind their design principles, combined with graph complications, make it difficult to understand and even compare their difference in tackling the oversmoothing. In this paper, we propose ATNPA, a unified view with five key steps: Augmentation, Transformation, Normalization, Propagation, and Aggregation, to summarize GNN oversmoothing alleviation approaches. We first outline three themes to tackle oversmoothing, and then separate all methods into six categories, followed by detailed reviews of representative methods, including their relation to the ATNPA, and discussion about their niche, strength, and weakness. The review not only draws in-depth understanding of existing methods in the field, but also shows a clear road map for future study.">

One algorithm enforces the equation and initial boundary conditions to hold on some collocation points, and another algorithm enforces $L^2$-norm of the residual of the equation and initial boundary conditions to be $0$. Our method can achieve high accuracy with low cost of training. Moreover, our method is free of parameters that need to be artificially adjusted. Numerical examples show that the cost of training these base functions of subspace is low, and only one hundred to two thousand epochs are needed for most tests.

        <tr id="Diffusion models (DMs) are capable of generating remarkably high-quality samples by iteratively denoising a random vector, a process that corresponds to moving along the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF ODE). Interestingly, DMs can also invert an input image to noise by moving backward along the PF ODE, a key operation for downstream tasks such as interpolation and image editing. However, the iterative nature of this process restricts its speed, hindering its broader application. Recently, Consistency Models (CMs) have emerged to address this challenge by approximating the integral of the PF ODE, largely reducing the number of iterations. Yet, the absence of an explicit ODE solver complicates the inversion process. To resolve this, we introduce the Bidirectional Consistency Model (BCM), which learns a single neural network that enables both forward and backward traversal along the PF ODE, efficiently unifying generation and inversion tasks within one framework. Notably, our proposed method enables one-step generation and inversion while also allowing the use of additional steps to enhance generation quality or reduce reconstruction error. Furthermore, by leveraging our model's bidirectional consistency, we introduce a sampling strategy that can enhance FID while preserving the generated image content. We further showcase our model's capabilities in several downstream tasks, such as interpolation and inpainting, and present demonstrations of potential applications, including blind restoration of compressed images and defending black-box adversarial attacks.">

Complex Network Theory (CNT), merging statistical physics with graph theory, provides a method for interpreting neural networks by analysing their weights and neuron structures. However, classic works adapt CNT metrics that only permit a topological analysis as they do not account for the effect of the input data. In addition, CNT metrics have been applied to a limited range of architectures, mainly including Fully Connected neural networks. In this work, we extend the existing CNT metrics with measures that sample from the DNNs' training distribution, shifting from a purely topological analysis to one that connects with the interpretability of deep learning. For the novel metrics, in addition to the existing ones, we provide a mathematical formalisation for Fully Connected, AutoEncoder, Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks, of which we vary the activation functions and the number of hidden layers. We show that these metrics differentiate DNNs based on the architecture, the number of hidden layers, and the activation function. Our contribution provides a method rooted in physics for interpreting DNNs that offers insights beyond the traditional input-output relationship and the CNT topological analysis.">

Owing to its differentiable nature, BFNs are promising in modeling both continuous and discrete data, while simultaneously maintaining fast sampling capabilities. This paper aims to understand and enhance BFNs by connecting them with DMs through stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We identify the linear SDEs corresponding to the noise-addition processes in BFNs, demonstrate that BFN's regression losses are aligned with denoise score matching, and validate the sampler in BFN as a first-order solver for the respective reverse-time SDE. Based on these findings and existing recipes of fast sampling in DMs, we propose specialized solvers for BFNs that markedly surpass the original BFN sampler in terms of sample quality with a limited number of function evaluations (e.g., 10) on both image and text datasets.

In this work, we introduce, for the first time, a multidimensional interpolant that extends these coefficients into multiple dimensions, leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework. Additionally, we propose a novel path optimization problem tailored to adaptively determine multidimensional inference trajectories, with a predetermined differential equation solver and a fixed number of function evaluations. Our solution involves simulation dynamics coupled with adversarial training to optimize the inference path. Notably, employing a multidimensional interpolant during training improves the model's inference performance, even in the absence of path optimization. When the adaptive, multidimensional path derived from our optimization process is employed, it yields further performance gains, even with fixed solver configurations. The introduction of multidimensional interpolants not only enhances the efficacy of models but also opens up a new domain for exploration in training and inference methodologies, emphasizing the potential of multidimensional paths as an untapped frontier.">

        <tr id="Using neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) is gaining popularity as an alternative approach in the scientific computing community. Neural networks can integrate different types of information into the loss function. These include observation data, governing equations, and variational forms, etc. These loss functions can be broadly categorized into two types: observation data loss directly constrains and measures the model output, while other loss functions indirectly model the performance of the network, which can be classified as model loss. However, this alternative approach lacks a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms, including theoretical foundations and rigorous characterization of various phenomena. This work focuses on investigating how different loss functions impact the training of neural networks for solving PDEs. We discover a stable loss-jump phenomenon: when switching the loss function from the data loss to the model loss, which includes different orders of derivative information, the neural network solution significantly deviates from the exact solution immediately. Further experiments reveal that this phenomenon arises from the different frequency preferences of neural networks under different loss functions. We theoretically analyze the frequency preference of neural networks under model loss. This loss-jump phenomenon provides a valuable perspective for examining the underlying mechanisms of neural networks in solving PDEs.">

However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a symmetry group based domain decomposition strategy to enhance the PINN for solving the forward and inverse problems of the PDEs possessing a Lie symmetry group. Specifically, for the forward problem, we first deploy the symmetry group to generate the dividing-lines having known solution information which can be adjusted flexibly and are used to divide the whole training domain into a finite number of non-overlapping sub-domains, then utilize the PINN and the symmetry-enhanced PINN methods to learn the solutions in each sub-domain and finally stitch them to the overall solution of PDEs. For the inverse problem, we first utilize the symmetry group acting on the data of the initial and boundary conditions to generate labeled data in the interior domain of PDEs and then find the undetermined parameters as well as the solution by only training the neural networks in a sub-domain. Consequently, the proposed method can predict high-accuracy solutions of PDEs which are failed by the vanilla PINN in the whole domain and the extended physics-informed neural network in the same sub-domains. Numerical results of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with a translation symmetry and the nonlinear viscous fluid equation with a scaling symmetry show that the accuracies of the learned solutions are improved largely.">

With sufficient training data where all spatiotemporal patterns are well-represented, existing deep-learning models can make reasonably accurate predictions. However, existing methods fail when the training data are drawn from different circumstances (e.g., traffic patterns on regular days) compared to test data (e.g., traffic patterns after a natural disaster). Such challenges are usually classified under domain generalization. In this work, we show that one way to address this challenge in the context of spatiotemporal prediction is by incorporating domain differential equations into Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). We theoretically derive conditions where GCNs incorporating such domain differential equations are robust to mismatched training and testing data compared to baseline domain agnostic models. To support our theory, we propose two domain-differential-equation-informed networks called Reaction-Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (RDGCN), which incorporates differential equations for traffic speed evolution, and Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered Graph Convolutional Network (SIRGCN), which incorporates a disease propagation model. Both RDGCN and SIRGCN are based on reliable and interpretable domain differential equations that allow the models to generalize to unseen patterns. We experimentally show that RDGCN and SIRGCN are more robust with mismatched testing data than the state-of-the-art deep learning methods.">

Taking the viscous Burgers equation as an example, this paper constructs a Convolutional Autoencoder-Reservoir Computing-Normalizing Flow algorithm framework, where the Convolutional Autoencoder is used to construct latent space representations, and the Reservoir Computing-Normalizing Flow framework is used to characterize the evolution of latent state variables.

        <tr id="Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning (SciML) combines the powerful predictive power of SciML with methods for quantifying the reliability of the learned models. However, two major challenges remain: limited interpretability and expensive training procedures. We provide a new interpretation for UQ problems by establishing a new theoretical connection between some Bayesian inference problems arising in SciML and viscous Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs). Namely, we show that the posterior mean and covariance can be recovered from the spatial gradient and Hessian of the solution to a viscous HJ PDE. As a first exploration of this connection, we specialize to Bayesian inference problems with linear models, Gaussian likelihoods, and Gaussian priors. In this case, the associated viscous HJ PDEs can be solved using Riccati ODEs, and we develop a new Riccati-based methodology that provides computational advantages when continuously updating the model predictions. Specifically, our Riccati-based approach can efficiently add or remove data points to the training set invariant to the order of the data and continuously tune hyperparameters. Moreover, neither update requires retraining on or access to previously incorporated data. We provide several examples from SciML involving noisy data and \textit{epistemic uncertainty} to illustrate the potential advantages of our approach. In particular, this approach's amenability to data streaming applications demonstrates its potential for real-time inferences, which, in turn, allows for applications in which the predicted uncertainty is used to dynamically alter the learning process.">

        <tr id="In this work, we propose a novel backward differential deep learning-based algorithm for solving high-dimensional nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), where the deep neural network (DNN) models are trained not only on the inputs and labels but also the differentials of the corresponding labels. This is motivated by the fact that differential deep learning can provide an efficient approximation of the labels and their derivatives with respect to inputs. The BSDEs are reformulated as differential deep learning problems by using Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin derivatives of solution to a BSDE satisfy themselves another BSDE, resulting thus in a system of BSDEs. Such formulation requires the estimation of the solution, its gradient, and the Hessian matrix, represented by the triple of processes $\left(Y, Z, \Gamma\right).$ All the integrals within this system are discretized by using the Euler-Maruyama method. Subsequently, DNNs are employed to approximate the triple of these unknown processes. The DNN parameters are backwardly optimized at each time step by minimizing a differential learning type loss function, which is defined as a weighted sum of the dynamics of the discretized BSDE system, with the first term providing the dynamics of the process $Y$ and the other the process $Z$. An error analysis is carried out to show the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Various numerical experiments up to $50$ dimensions are provided to demonstrate the high efficiency. Both theoretically and numerically, it is demonstrated that our proposed scheme is more efficient compared to other contemporary deep learning-based methodologies, especially in the computation of the process $\Gamma$.">

For this purpose, we interpret neural networks as time-varying dynamical systems, where the $k$-th layer corresponds to the dynamics at time $k$. A key novelty with respect to prior work is that we use this interpretation to exploit the series interconnection structure of neural networks with a dynamic programming recursion. Nonlinearities, such as activation functions and nonlinear pooling layers, are handled with integral quadratic constraints. If the neural network contains signal processing layers (convolutional or state space model layers), we realize them as 1-D/2-D/N-D systems and exploit this structure as well. We distinguish ourselves from related work on Lipschitz constant estimation by more extensive structure exploitation (scalability) and a generalization to a large class of common neural network architectures. To show the versatility and computational advantages of our method, we apply it to different neural network architectures trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10.">

The use of tensor feedforward networks allows us to efficiently exploit auto-differentiation in major Python packages while using radial basis functions can fully avoid auto-differentiation, which is rather expensive in high dimensions. We then use the physics-informed neural networks and stochastic gradient descent methods to learn the tensor networks. One essential step is to determine a proper truncated bounded domain or numerical support for the Fokker-Planck equation. To better train the tensor radial basis function networks, we impose some constraints on parameters, which lead to relatively high accuracy.

Our method automates calculating partial derivatives, constructing a candidate library, and estimating a sparse model. We rigorously evaluate the performance of ARGOS-RAL in identifying canonical PDEs under various noise levels and sample sizes, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy and non-uniformly distributed data. We also test the algorithm's performance on datasets consisting solely of random noise to simulate scenarios with severely compromised data quality. Our results show that ARGOS-RAL effectively and reliably identifies the underlying PDEs from data, outperforming the sequential threshold ridge regression method in most cases. We highlight the potential of combining statistical methods, machine learning, and dynamical systems theory to automatically discover governing equations from collected data, streamlining the scientific modeling process.">

From a machine learning perspective, we list several practically desirable axioms and derive from these which PDEs should be used in a PDE-CNN.

        <tr id="Time-dependent flow fields are typically generated by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, which is an extremely time-consuming process. However, the latent relationship between the flow fields is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations and can be described by an operator. We therefore train a deep operator network, or simply DeepONet, to learn the temporal evolution between flow snapshots. Once properly trained, given a few consecutive snapshots as input, the network has a great potential to generate the next snapshot accurately and quickly. Using the output as a new input, the network iterates the process, generating a series of successive snapshots with little wall time. Specifically, we consider 2D flow around a circular cylinder at Reynolds number 1000, and prepare a set of high-fidelity data using a high-order spectral/hp element method as ground truth. Although the flow fields are periodic, there are many small-scale features in the wake flow that are difficult to generate accurately. Furthermore, any discrepancy between the prediction and the ground truth for the first snapshots can easily accumulate during the iterative process, which eventually amplifies the overall deviations. Therefore, we propose two alternative techniques to improve the training of DeepONet. The first one enhances the feature extraction of the network by harnessing the"multi-head non-local block". The second one refines the network parameters by leveraging the local smooth optimization technique. Both techniques prove to be highly effective in reducing the cumulative errors and our results outperform those of the dynamic mode decomposition method.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a novel and popular approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, achieving stable training and obtaining correct results remain a challenge in many cases, often attributed to the ill-conditioning of PINNs. Nonetheless, further analysis is still lacking, severely limiting the progress and applications of PINNs in complex engineering problems. Drawing inspiration from the ill-conditioning analysis in traditional numerical methods, we establish a connection between the ill-conditioning of PINNs and the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian matrix of the PDE system. Specifically, for any given PDE system, we construct its controlled system. This controlled system allows for adjustment of the condition number of the Jacobian matrix while retaining the same solution as the original system. Our numerical findings suggest that the ill-conditioning observed in PINNs predominantly stems from that of the Jacobian matrix. As the condition number of the Jacobian matrix decreases, the controlled systems exhibit faster convergence rates and higher accuracy. Building upon this understanding and the natural extension of controlled systems, we present a general approach to mitigate the ill-conditioning of PINNs, leading to successful simulations of the three-dimensional flow around the M6 wing at a Reynolds number of 5,000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PINNs have been successful in simulating such complex systems, offering a promising new technique for addressing industrial complexity problems. Our findings also offer valuable insights guiding the future development of PINNs.">

Specifically, we demonstrate that the update equations derived by discretizing Maxwell's partial differential equations can be innately expressed as a two-layer GNN with static and pre-determined edge weights. Given this intuition, a straightforward way to numerically solve Maxwell's equations entails simple message passing between such a GNN's nodes, yielding a significant computational time gain, while preserving the same accuracy as conventional transient CEM methods. Ultimately, our work supports the efficient and precise emulation of electromagnetic wave propagation with GNNs, and more importantly, we anticipate that applying a similar treatment to systems of partial differential equations arising in other scientific disciplines, e.g., computational fluid dynamics, can benefit computational sciences">

For error components with frequencies distant from the wavenumber, we perform simple smoothing based on local operations at different levels to eliminate them. On the other hand, to address error components with frequencies near the wavenumber, we utilize another multigrid V-cycle to solve an advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation at a coarse scale. The resulting solver, named Wave-ADR-NS, involves parameters learned through unsupervised training. Numerical results demonstrate that Wave-ADR-NS effectively resolves heterogeneous 2D Helmholtz equation with wavenumber up to 2000. Comparative experiments against classical multigrid preconditioners and existing deep learning-based multigrid preconditioners reveals the superior performance of Wave-ADR-NS.">

        <tr id="Operational weather forecasting models have advanced for decades on both the explicit numerical solvers and the empirical physical parameterization schemes. However, the involved high computational costs and uncertainties in these existing schemes are requiring potential improvements through alternative machine learning methods. Previous works use a unified model to learn the dynamics and physics of the atmospheric model. Contrarily, we propose a simple yet effective machine learning model that learns the horizontal movement in the dynamical core and vertical movement in the physical parameterization separately. By replacing the advection with a graph attention network and the convection with a multi-layer perceptron, our model provides a new and efficient perspective to simulate the transition of variables in atmospheric models. We also assess the model's performance over a 5-day iterative forecasting. Under the same input variables and training methods, our model outperforms existing data-driven methods with a significantly-reduced number of parameters with a resolution of 5.625 deg. Overall, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts that leverage machine learning techniques for improving both the accuracy and efficiency of global weather forecasting.">

        <tr id="Optimal control of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is crucial in many applications in engineering and science. In recent years, the progress in scientific machine learning has opened up new frontiers for the control of parametric PDEs. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has the potential to solve high-dimensional and complex control problems in a large variety of applications. Most DRL methods rely on deep neural network (DNN) control policies. However, for many dynamical systems, DNN-based control policies tend to be over-parametrized, which means they need large amounts of training data, show limited robustness, and lack interpretability. In this work, we leverage dictionary learning and differentiable L$_0$ regularization to learn sparse, robust, and interpretable control policies for parametric PDEs. Our sparse policy architecture is agnostic to the DRL method and can be used in different policy-gradient and actor-critic DRL algorithms without changing their policy-optimization procedure. We test our approach on the challenging tasks of controlling parametric Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and convection-diffusion-reaction PDEs. We show that our method (1) outperforms baseline DNN-based DRL policies, (2) allows for the derivation of interpretable equations of the learned optimal control laws, and (3) generalizes to unseen parameters of the PDE without retraining the policies.">

        <tr id="In biochemical modeling, some foundational systems can exhibit sudden and profound behavioral shifts, such as the cellular signaling pathway models, in which the physiological responses promptly react to environmental changes, resulting in steep changes in their dynamic model trajectories. These steep changes are one of the major challenges in biochemical modeling governed by nonlinear differential equations. One promising way to tackle this challenge is converting the input data from the time domain to the frequency domain through Fourier Neural Operators, which enhances the ability to analyze data periodicity and regularity. However, the effectiveness of these Fourier based methods diminishes in scenarios with complex abrupt switches. To address this limitation, an innovative Multiscale Attention Wavelet Neural Operator (MAWNO) method is proposed in this paper, which comprehensively combines the attention mechanism with the versatile wavelet transforms to effectively capture these abrupt switches. Specifically, the wavelet transform scrutinizes data across multiple scales to extract the characteristics of abrupt signals into wavelet coefficients, while the self-attention mechanism is adeptly introduced to enhance the wavelet coefficients in high-frequency signals that can better characterize the abrupt switches. Experimental results substantiate MAWNO’s supremacy in terms of accuracy on three classical biochemical models featuring periodic and steep trajectories. https://github.com/SUDERS/MAWNO.">

        <tr id="Signature kernels are at the core of several machine learning algorithms for analysing multivariate time series. The kernel of two bounded variation paths (such as piecewise linear interpolations of time series data) is typically computed by solving a Goursat problem for a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) in two independent time variables. However, this approach becomes considerably less practical for highly oscillatory input paths, as they have to be resolved at a fine enough scale to accurately recover their signature kernel, resulting in significant time and memory complexities. To mitigate this issue, we first show that the signature kernel of a broader class of paths, known as \emph{smooth rough paths}, also satisfies a PDE, albeit in the form of a system of coupled equations. We then use this result to introduce new algorithms for the numerical approximation of signature kernels. As bounded variation paths (and more generally geometric $p$-rough paths) can be approximated by piecewise smooth rough paths, one can replace the PDE with rapidly varying coefficients in the original Goursat problem by an explicit system of coupled equations with piecewise constant coefficients derived from the first few iterated integrals of the original input paths. While this approach requires solving more equations, they do not require looking back at the complex and fine structure of the initial paths, which significantly reduces the computational complexity associated with the analysis of highly oscillatory time series.">

        <tr id="Hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (HGCNs) have demonstrated representational capabilities of modeling hierarchical-structured graphs. However, as in general GCNs, over-smoothing may occur as the number of model layers increases, limiting the representation capabilities of most current HGCN models. In this paper, we propose residual hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (R-HGCNs) to address the over-smoothing problem. We introduce a hyperbolic residual connection function to overcome the over-smoothing problem, and also theoretically prove the effectiveness of the hyperbolic residual function. Moreover, we use product manifolds and HyperDrop to facilitate the R-HGCNs. The distinctive features of the R-HGCNs are as follows: (1) The hyperbolic residual connection preserves the initial node information in each layer and adds a hyperbolic identity mapping to prevent node features from being indistinguishable. (2) Product manifolds in R-HGCNs have been set up with different origin points in different components to facilitate the extraction of feature information from a wider range of perspectives, which enhances the representing capability of R-HGCNs. (3) HyperDrop adds multiplicative Gaussian noise into hyperbolic representations, such that perturbations can be added to alleviate the over-fitting problem without deconstructing the hyperbolic geometry.
Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of R-HGCNs under various graph convolution layers and different structures of product manifolds.">

However, despite their user-friendly interface and broad applicability, PINNs encounter challenges in accurately resolving PDEs, especially when dealing with singular cases that may lead to unsatisfactory local minima. To address these challenges and improve solution accuracy, we propose an innovative approach called Annealed Adaptive Importance Sampling (AAIS) for computing the discretized PDE residuals of the cost functions, inspired by the Expectation Maximization algorithm used in finite mixtures to mimic target density. Our objective is to approximate discretized PDE residuals by strategically sampling additional points in regions with elevated residuals, thus enhancing the effectiveness and accuracy of PINNs. Implemented together with a straightforward resampling strategy within PINNs, our AAIS algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency across a range of tested PDEs, even with limited training datasets. Moreover, our proposed AAIS-PINN method shows promising capabilities in solving high-dimensional singular PDEs. The adaptive sampling framework introduced here can be integrated into various PINN frameworks.">

Inspired by this, we incorporate a bell-shaped tuning curve into the discrete group convolution to achieve continuous group equivariance. Simply, we modulate group convolution kernels by Gauss functions to obtain bell-shaped tuning curves. Benefiting from the modulation, kernels also gain smooth gradients on geometric dimensions (e.g., location dimension and orientation dimension). It allows us to generate group convolution kernels from sparse weights with learnable geometric parameters, which can achieve both competitive performances and parameter efficiencies. Furthermore, we quantitatively prove that discrete group convolutions with proper tuning curves (bigger than 1x sampling step) can achieve continuous equivariance. Experimental results show that 1) our approach achieves very competitive performances on MNIST-rot with at least 75% fewer parameters compared with previous SOTA methods, which is efficient in parameter; 2) Especially with small sample sizes, our approach exhibits more pronounced performance improvements (up to 24%); 3) It also has excellent rotation generalization ability on various datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet with both plain and ResNet architectures.">

        <tr id="A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA). In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems. The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible. Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy. This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills. With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty. Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems. Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.">

Two recent works introduced a geometric framework to study neural networks making use of singular Riemannian metrics. In this paper we extend these results to convolutional, residual and recursive neural networks, studying also the case of non-differentiable activation functions, such as ReLU.

However, they are often prohibitively more expensive from a computational point of view and cannot be applied to maximum likelihood training in a scalable manner, which severely hinders their widespread adoption. In this work, we overcome these crucial limitations. Specifically, we propose a fast path gradient estimator which improves computational efficiency significantly and works for all normalizing flow architectures of practical relevance. We then show that this estimator can also be applied to maximum likelihood training for which it has a regularizing effect as it can take the form of a given target energy function into account.

When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations.

We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points.

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate physical principles-typically mathematical models expressed as differential equations-into the machine learning (ML) processes to guarantee the physical validity of ML model solutions. This approach has gained traction in science and engineering for modeling a wide range of physical phenomena. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of PINNs in solving nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), is found challenging due to discontinuities inherent in such PDE solutions. While previous research has focused on advancing training algorithms, our study highlights that encoding precise physical laws into PINN framework suffices to address the challenge. By coupling well-constructed governing equations into the most basic, simply structured PINNs, this research tackles both data-independent solution and data-driven discovery of the Buckley-Leverett equation, a typical hyperbolic PDE central to modeling multi-phase fluid flow in porous media. Our results reveal that vanilla PINNs are adequate to solve the Buckley-Leverett equation with superior precision and even handling more complex scenarios including variations in fluid mobility ratios, the addition of a gravity term to the original governing equation, and the presence of multiple discontinuities in the solution. This capability of PINNs enables accurate, efficient modeling and prediction of practical engineering problems, such as water flooding, polymer flooding, inclined flooding, and carbon dioxide injection into saline aquifers. Furthermore, the forward PINN framework with slight modifications can be adapted for inverse problems, allowing the estimation of PDE parameters in the Buckley-Leverett equation from observed data. Sensitivity analysis demonstrate that PINNs remain effective under conditions of slight data scarcity and up to a 5% data impurity.">

To further investigate the potential of the deep SSMs, we start with exponential smoothing (ETS), a simple SSM, and propose a stacked architecture by directly incorporating it into an element-wise MLP. We augment simple ETS with additional parameters and complex field to reduce the inductive bias.

By augmenting the previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position, velocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data generation at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude. Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.">

        <tr id="For the recently introduced deep learning-powered approach to PDE backstepping control, we present an advancement applicable across all the results developed thus far: approximating the control gain function only (a function of one variable), rather than the entire kernel function of the backstepping transformation (a function of two variables). We introduce this idea on a couple benchmark (unstable) PDEs, hyperbolic and parabolic. We alter the approach of quantifying the effect of the approximation error by replacing a backstepping transformation that employs the approximated kernel (suitable for adaptive control) by a transformation that employs the exact kernel (suitable for gain scheduling). A major simplification in the target system arises, with the perturbation due to the approximation shifting from the domain to the boundary condition. This results in a significant difference in the Lyapunov analysis, which nevertheless results in a guarantee of the stability being retained with the simplified approximation approach. The approach of approximating only the control gain function simplifies the operator being approximated and the training of its neural approximation, with an expected reduction in the neural network size. The price for the savings in approximation is paid through a somewhat more intricate Lyapunov analysis, in higher Sobolev spaces for some PDEs, as well as some restrictions on initial conditions that result from higher Sobolev spaces. While the proposed approach appears inapplicable to uses in adaptive control, it is almost certainly applicable in gain scheduling applications of neural operator-approximated PDE backstepping controllers.">

Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.">

This study addresses these challenges by incorporating the discretized forms of the governing equations into the PINN framework. We propose to combine the power of neural networks with the dynamics imposed by the discretized differential equations. By discretizing the governing equations, the PINN learns to account for the discontinuities and accurately capture the underlying relationships between inputs and outputs, improving the accuracy compared to traditional interpolation techniques. Moreover, by leveraging the power of neural networks, the computational cost associated with numerical simulations is substantially reduced.

Through careful design, the time series autoencoder can compress multivariate timestamp patterns into a concise latent representation by considering dynamic statistics.

        <tr id="Deep learning algorithms provide a new paradigm to study high-dimensional dynamical behaviors, such as those in fusion plasma systems. Development of novel model reduction methods, coupled with detection of abnormal modes with plasma physics, opens a unique opportunity for building efficient models to identify plasma instabilities for real-time control. Our Fusion Transfer Learning (FTL) model demonstrates success in reconstructing nonlinear kink mode structures by learning from a limited amount of nonlinear simulation data. The knowledge transfer process leverages a pre-trained neural encoder-decoder network, initially trained on linear simulations, to effectively capture nonlinear dynamics. The low-dimensional embeddings extract the coherent structures of interest, while preserving the inherent dynamics of the complex system. Experimental results highlight FTL's capacity to capture transitional behaviors and dynamical features in plasma dynamics -- a task often challenging for conventional methods. The model developed in this study is generalizable and can be extended broadly through transfer learning to address various magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) modes.">

In this sense, there is a need to find new ways to obtain data in a more economical manner. Thus, in this work we study the application of time series forecasting to fluid dynamics problems, where the aim is to predict the flow dynamics using only past information. We focus our study on models based on deep learning that do not require a high amount of data for training, as this is the problem we are trying to address. Specifically in this work we have tested three autoregressive models where two of them are fully based on deep learning and the other one is a hybrid model that combines modal decomposition with deep learning. We ask these models to generate $200$ time-ahead predictions of two datasets coming from a numerical simulation and experimental measurements, where the latter is characterized by being turbulent. We show how the hybrid model generates more reliable predictions in the experimental case, as it is physics-informed in the sense that the modal decomposition extracts the physics in a way that allows us to predict it.">

The proposed method is particularly effective in solving classes of variational problems, specifically monotone inclusion problems, commonly encountered in image processing tasks. The Forward-Backward-Forward (FBF) algorithm is employed to address these problems, offering a solution even when the Lipschitz constant of the neural network is unknown. Notably, the FBF algorithm provides convergence guarantees under the condition that the learned operator is monotone. Building on plug-and-play methodologies, our objective is to apply these newly learned operators to solving non-linear inverse problems. To achieve this, we initially formulate the problem as a variational inclusion problem. Subsequently, we train a monotone neural network to approximate an operator that may not inherently be monotone. Leveraging the FBF algorithm, we then show simulation examples where the non-linear inverse problem is successfully solved.">

        <tr id="Effective learning in neuronal networks requires the adaptation of individual synapses given their relative contribution to solving a task. However, physical neuronal systems -- whether biological or artificial -- are constrained by spatio-temporal locality. How such networks can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In Machine Learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space (BP) and time (BPTT). However, BP(TT) is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatiotemporal (non-)locality, while forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) suffer from prohibitive memory constraints. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of BPTT in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, performing an effective spatiotemporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint states necessary for useful parameter updates.">

We introduce a variational discrete posterior distribution of the latent states given the observations and a two-stage training procedure to alternatively train the parameters of the latent states and of the emission distributions.

        <tr id="Of all the vector fields surrounding the minima of recurrent learning setups, the gradient field with its exploding and vanishing updates appears a poor choice for optimization, offering little beyond efficient computability. We seek to improve this suboptimal practice in the context of physics simulations, where backpropagating feedback through many unrolled time steps is considered crucial to acquiring temporally coherent behavior. The alternative vector field we propose follows from two principles: physics simulators, unlike neural networks, have a balanced gradient flow, and certain modifications to the backpropagation pass leave the positions of the original minima unchanged. As any modification of backpropagation decouples forward and backward pass, the rotation-free character of the gradient field is lost. Therefore, we discuss the negative implications of using such a rotational vector field for optimization and how to counteract them. Our final procedure is easily implementable via a sequence of gradient stopping and component-wise comparison operations, which do not negatively affect scalability. Our experiments on three control problems show that especially as we increase the complexity of each task, the unbalanced updates from the gradient can no longer provide the precise control signals necessary while our method still solves the tasks.

        <tr id="Symbolic Regression (SR) is a widely studied field of research that aims to infer symbolic expressions from data. A popular approach for SR is the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (\sindy) framework, which uses sparse regression to identify governing equations from data. This study introduces an enhanced method, Nested SINDy, that aims to increase the expressivity of the SINDy approach thanks to a nested structure. Indeed, traditional symbolic regression and system identification methods often fail with complex systems that cannot be easily described analytically. Nested SINDy builds on the SINDy framework by introducing additional layers before and after the core SINDy layer. This allows the method to identify symbolic representations for a wider range of systems, including those with compositions and products of functions. We demonstrate the ability of the Nested SINDy approach to accurately find symbolic expressions for simple systems, such as basic trigonometric functions, and sparse (false but accurate) analytical representations for more complex systems. Our results highlight Nested SINDy's potential as a tool for symbolic regression, surpassing the traditional SINDy approach in terms of expressivity. However, we also note the challenges in the optimization process for Nested SINDy and suggest future research directions, including the designing of a more robust methodology for the optimization process. This study proves that Nested SINDy can effectively discover symbolic representations of dynamical systems from data, offering new opportunities for understanding complex systems through data-driven methods.">

        <tr id="Formulating dynamical models for physical phenomena is essential for understanding the interplay between the different mechanisms and predicting the evolution of physical states. However, a dynamical model alone is often insufficient to address these fundamental tasks, as it suffers from model errors and uncertainties. One common remedy is to rely on data assimilation, where the state estimate is updated with observations of the true system. Ensemble filters sequentially assimilate observations by updating a set of samples over time. They operate in two steps: a forecast step that propagates each sample through the dynamical model and an analysis step that updates the samples with incoming observations. For accurate and robust predictions of dynamical systems, discrete solutions must preserve their critical invariants. While modern numerical solvers satisfy these invariants, existing invariant-preserving analysis steps are limited to Gaussian settings and are often not compatible with classical regularization techniques of ensemble filters, e.g., inflation and covariance tapering. The present work focuses on preserving linear invariants, such as mass, stoichiometric balance of chemical species, and electrical charges. Using tools from measure transport theory (Spantini et al., 2022, SIAM Review), we introduce a generic class of nonlinear ensemble filters that automatically preserve desired linear invariants in non-Gaussian filtering problems. By specializing this framework to the Gaussian setting, we recover a constrained formulation of the Kalman filter. Then, we show how to combine existing regularization techniques for the ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994, J. Geophys. Res.) with the preservation of the linear invariants. Finally, we assess the benefits of preserving linear invariants for the ensemble Kalman filter and nonlinear ensemble filters.">

        <tr id="Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) hold immense potential for computations due to their Turing completeness and sequential processing capabilities, yet existing methods for their training encounter efficiency challenges. Backpropagation through time (BPTT), the prevailing method, extends the backpropagation (BP) algorithm by unrolling the RNN over time. However, this approach suffers from significant drawbacks, including the need to interleave forward and backward phases and store exact gradient information. Furthermore, BPTT has been shown to struggle with propagating gradient information for long sequences, leading to vanishing gradients. An alternative strategy to using gradient-based methods like BPTT involves stochastically approximating gradients through perturbation-based methods. This learning approach is exceptionally simple, necessitating only forward passes in the network and a global reinforcement signal as feedback. Despite its simplicity, the random nature of its updates typically leads to inefficient optimization, limiting its effectiveness in training neural networks. In this study, we present a new approach to perturbation-based learning in RNNs whose performance is competitive with BPTT, while maintaining the inherent advantages over gradient-based learning. To this end, we extend the recently introduced activity-based node perturbation (ANP) method to operate in the time domain, leading to more efficient learning and generalization. Subsequently, we conduct a range of experiments to validate our approach. Our results show similar performance, convergence time and scalability when compared to BPTT, strongly outperforming standard node perturbation and weight perturbation methods. These findings suggest that perturbation-based learning methods offer a versatile alternative to gradient-based methods for training RNNs.">

However, current deep learning methods struggle to achieve generalization to flow field resolutions while ensuring computational efficiency. This paper presents a deep learning approach for rapid prediction of two types of subsonic flow fields with different resolutions. Unlike convolutional neural networks, the constructed feature extractor integrates features of different spatial scales along the channel dimension, reducing the sensitivity of the deep learning model to resolution while improving computational efficiency. Additionally, to ensure consistency between the input and output resolutions of the deep learning model, a memory pooling strategy is proposed, which ensures accurate reconstruction of flow fields at any resolution. By conducting extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses on a given test dataset, it is demonstrated that the proposed deep learning model can achieve a three-order-of-magnitude speedup compared to CPU-based solvers while adapting to flow fields of arbitrary resolutions. Moreover, the prediction accuracy for pressure exceeds 99\%, laying the foundation for the development of large-scale models in the field of aerodynamics.">

To overcome these issues, we have developed a tensor-train-adapted stochastic finite volume method that employs a global WENO reconstruction, making it suitable for such complex systems.

However, the application of deep neural networks for flow simulations has mainly concentrated on relatively simple cases of incompressible flows. The strongly discontinuous structures that appear in compressible flows dominated by convection, such as shock waves, introduce significant challenges when approximating the nonlinear solutions or governing equations. In this work, we propose a novel physics-constrained, flow-field-message-informed (FFMI) graph neural network for spatiotemporal flow simulations of compressible flows involving strong discontinuities. To enhance the nonlinear approximation capability of strong discontinuities, a shock detector method is leveraged to extract the local flow-field messages. These messages are embedded into the graph representation to resolve the discontinuous solutions accurately. A new FFMI sample-and-aggregate-based message-passing layer, which aggregates the edge-weighted attributes with node features on different hop layers, is then developed to diffuse and process the flow-field messages. Furthermore, an end-to-end paradigm is established within the encoder–decoder framework to transform the extracted information from the flow field into latent knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Finally, a variety of one- and two-dimensional cases involving strong shock waves are considered to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed FFMI graph neural network.">

Despite the fast-paced development in deep learning architectures for anomaly detection, model optimization for a given dataset is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. Neuroevolution could be an effective and efficient solution to this problem, as a fully automated search method for learning optimal neural networks, supporting both gradient and non-gradient fine tuning. However, existing frameworks incorporating neuroevolution lack of support for new layers and architectures and are typically limited to convolutional and LSTM layers. In this paper we propose AD-NEv++, a three-stage neuroevolution-based method that synergically combines subspace evolution, model evolution, and fine-tuning. Our method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by optimizing the mutation operator in the neuroevolution process, while supporting a wide spectrum of neural layers, including attention, dense, and graph convolutional layers. Our extensive experimental evaluation was conducted with widely adopted multivariate anomaly detection benchmark datasets, and showed that the models generated by AD-NEv++ outperform well-known deep learning architectures and neuroevolution-based approaches for anomaly detection. Moreover, results show that AD-NEv++ can improve and outperform the state-of-the-art GNN (Graph Neural Networks) model architecture in all anomaly detection benchmarks.">

Unlike conventional computational fluid dynamics methods, PINNs offer advantages by eliminating the need for discretized meshes and enabling the direct solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we propose the weighted Extended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WXPINNs) and weighted Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WCPINNs), tailored for detailed hemodynamic simulations based on generalized space-time domain decomposition techniques. The inclusion of multiple neural networks enhances the representation capacity of the weighted PINN methods. Furthermore, the weighted PINNs can be efficiently trained in parallel computing frameworks by employing separate neural networks for each sub-domain. We show that PINNs simulation results circumvent backflow instabilities, underscoring a notable advantage of employing PINNs over traditional numerical methods to solve such complex blood flow models. They naturally address such challenges within their formulations. The presented numerical results demonstrate that the proposed weighted PINNs outperform traditional PINNs settings, where sub-PINNs are applied to each subdomain separately. This study contributes to the integration of deep learning methodologies with fluid mechanics, paving the way for accurate and efficient high-fidelity simulations in biomedical applications, particularly in modeling arterial blood flow.">

        <tr id="The discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) from datasets has attracted increased attention. However, the discovery of governing equations from sparse data with high noise is still very challenging due to the difficulty of derivatives computation and the disturbance of noise. Moreover, the selection principles for the candidate library to meet physical laws need to be further studied. The invariance is one of the fundamental laws for governing equations. In this study, we propose an invariance constrained deep learning network (ICNet) for the discovery of PDEs. Considering that temporal and spatial translation invariance (Galilean invariance) is a fundamental property of physical laws, we filter the candidates that cannot meet the requirement of the Galilean transformations. Subsequently, we embedded the fixed and possible terms into the loss function of neural network, significantly countering the effect of sparse data with high noise. Then, by filtering out redundant terms without fixing learnable parameters during the training process, the governing equations discovered by the ICNet method can effectively approximate the real governing equations. We select the one-dimensional (1D) Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, the two-dimensional (2D) Burgers equation, the equation of two-dimensional channel flow over an obstacle, and the equation of three-dimensional (3D) intracranial aneurysm as examples to verify the superiority of the ICNet for fluid mechanics. Furthermore, we extend similar invariance methods to the discovery of wave equation (Lorentz Invariance) and verify it through single and coupled Klein–Gordon equation. The results show that the ICNet method with physical constraints exhibits excellent performance in governing equations discovery from sparse and noisy data.">

Even though the computational barrier posed by a large ensemble of agents can be overcome through a mean field formulation of the control problem, the feasibility of its solution is generally guaranteed only for agents operating in low-dimensional spaces. To circumvent the difficulty posed by the high dimensionality of the state space a kinetic model is proposed, requiring the sampling of high-dimensional, two-agent sub-problems, to evolve the agents' density using a Boltzmann type equation. Such density evolution requires a high-frequency sampling of two-agent optimal control problems, which is efficiently approximated by means of deep neural networks and supervised learning, enabling the fast simulation of high-dimensional, large-scale ensembles of controlled particles. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the control of consensus and attraction-repulsion dynamics.">

Despite recent advancements, learning cluster-friendly representations is still challenging, particularly with long and complex time series. Deep temporal clustering methods have been trying to integrate the canonical k-means into end-to-end training of neural networks but fall back on surrogate losses due to the non-differentiability of the hard cluster assignment, yielding sub-optimal solutions. In addition, the autoregressive strategy used in the state-of-the-art RNNs is subject to error accumulation and slow training, while recent research findings have revealed that Transformers are less effective due to time points lacking semantic meaning, to the permutation invariance of attention that discards the chronological order and high computation cost. In light of these observations, we present LoSTer which is a novel dense autoencoder architecture for the long-sequence time series clustering problem (LSTC) capable of optimizing the k-means objective via the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization trick and designed specifically for accurate and fast clustering of long time series.

This phase is marked by an abrupt SNR increase, uniform residuals across the sample space and the most rapid training convergence. We propose a residual-based re-weighting scheme to accelerate this diffusion in quadratic loss functions, enhancing generalization. We also explore the information compression phenomenon, pinpointing a significant saturation-induced compression of activations at the total diffusion phase, with deeper layers experiencing negligible information loss.

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for approximating the distribution of complex data. It is known that data passing through a trained DNN classifier undergoes a series of geometric and topological simplifications. While some progress has been made toward understanding these transformations in neural networks with smooth activation functions, an understanding in the more general setting of non-smooth activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which tend to perform better, is required. Here we propose that the geometric transformations performed by DNNs during classification tasks have parallels to those expected under Hamilton's Ricci flow - a tool from differential geometry that evolves a manifold by smoothing its curvature, in order to identify its topology. To illustrate this idea, we present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a DNN, and use this framework to motivate a notion of `global Ricci network flow' that can be used to assess a DNN's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems. By training more than $1,500$ DNN classifiers of different widths and depths on synthetic and real-world data, we show that the strength of global Ricci network flow-like behaviour correlates with accuracy for well-trained DNNs, independently of depth, width and data set. Our findings motivate the use of tools from differential and discrete geometry to the problem of explainability in deep learning.">

        <tr id="The theory of forward–backward stochastic differential equations occupies an important position in stochastic analysis and practical applications. However, the numerical solution of forward–backward stochastic differential equations, especially for high-dimensional cases, has stagnated. The development of deep learning provides ideas for its high-dimensional solution. In this paper, our focus lies on the fully coupled forward–backward stochastic differential equation. We design a neural network structure tailored to the characteristics of the equation and develop a hybrid BiGRU model for solving it. We introduce the time dimension based on the sequence nature after discretizing the FBSDE. By considering the interactions between preceding and succeeding time steps, we construct the BiGRU hybrid model. This enables us to effectively capture both long- and short-term dependencies, thus mitigating issues such as gradient vanishing and explosion. Residual learning is introduced within the neural network at each time step; the structure of the loss function is adjusted according to the properties of the equation. The model established above can effectively solve fully coupled forward–backward stochastic differential equations, effectively avoiding the effects of dimensional catastrophe, gradient vanishing, and gradient explosion problems, with higher accuracy, stronger stability, and stronger model interpretability.">

Their temporal evolution is often driven by transitions between a finite number of discrete states.

We present Attentive Recurrent Neural Cellular Automata (AR-NCA), to effectively discover unknown local state transition rules by associating the temporal information between neighboring cells in a permutation-invariant manner. AR-NCA exhibits the superior generalizability across various system configurations (i.e., spatial distribution of states), data efficiency and robustness in extremely data-limited scenarios even in the presence of stochastic interactions, and scalability through spatial dimension-independent prediction.">

This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better performance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language tasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a latent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The same goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model dynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence modeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the corresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction to SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest research developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.">

Specifically, We estimate the velocity field through nonparametric regression and utilize Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating a series of discrete approximations to the characteristics. We then use a deep neural network to fit these characteristics, ensuring a one-step mapping that effectively pushes the prior distribution towards the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we analyze the errors in velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate for the characteristic generator in 2-Wasserstein distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough analysis for simulation-free one step generative models. Additionally, our analysis refines the error analysis of flow-based generative models in prior works.

        <tr id="This paper presents a real‐time optimization method for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) of systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The NMPC problem to be solved is formulated by discretizing the PDE system in space and time by using the finite difference method. The proposed method is called the double‐layer Jacobi method, which exploits both the spatial and temporal sparsities of the PDE‐constrained NMPC problem. In the upper layer, the NMPC problem is solved by ignoring the temporal couplings of either the state or costate (Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the state equation) equations so that the spatial sparsity is preserved. The lower‐layer Jacobi method is a linear solver dedicated to PDE‐constrained NMPC problems by exploiting the spatial sparsity. Convergence analysis indicates that the convergence of the proposed method is related to the prediction horizon. Results of a numerical experiment of controlling a heat transfer process show that the proposed method can be two orders of magnitude faster than the conventional Newton's method exploiting the banded structure of NMPC problems.">

Neural network based algorithms are meshless methods, which can avoid the curse of dimensionality. However, at low temperature, when directly solving a stationary Fokker-Planck equation with more than two metastable states in the generalized potential landscape, the small eigenvalue introduces numerical difficulties due to a large condition number. To overcome these problems, we introduce the IGANN method, which uses a penalty of negative input gradient annealing during the training.

It seeks an alternative approach for more efficient and simplified solutions. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is utilized to understand the intricate correlations between the oscillator’s variables and to precisely capture their dynamics by being trained on a dataset of known oscillator behaviors. In this work, we discuss the main challenge of predicting the behavior of oscillators without depending on complex strategies or time-consuming simulations. The present work proposes a favorable modified form of neural structure to improve the strategy for simulating linear and nonlinear harmonic oscillators from mechanical systems by formulating an ANN as a DNN via an appropriate oscillating activation function. The proposed methodology provides the solutions of linear and nonlinear differential equations (DEs) in differentiable form and is a more accurate approximation as compared to the traditional numerical method. The Van der Pol equation with parametric damping and the Mathieu equation are adopted as illustrations. Experimental analysis shows that our proposed scheme outperforms other numerical methods in terms of accuracy and computational cost. We provide a comparative analysis of the outcomes obtained through our proposed approach and those derived from the LSODA algorithm, utilizing numerical techniques, Adams–Bashforth, and the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF).

This approach constructs relevant features via projection onto learnable grids and interpolating adjacent vertices. However, it has limitations in capturing low-frequency details and tends to overuse parameters for low-frequency features due to its bias toward fine details, despite its multi-resolution concept. This phenomenon leads to instability and inefficiency when training poses are sparse. In this work, we propose a method that synergistically integrates multi-plane representation with a coordinate-based network known for strong bias toward low-frequency signals. The coordinate-based network is responsible for capturing low-frequency details, while the multi-plane representation focuses on capturing fine-grained details. We demonstrate that using residual connections between them seamlessly preserves their own inherent properties. Additionally, the proposed progressive training scheme accelerates the disentanglement of these two features. We empirically show that the proposed method achieves comparable results to explicit encoding with fewer parameters, and particularly, it outperforms others for the static and dynamic NeRFs under sparse inputs.">

Existing surrogate modeling approaches usually focus on approximating the deterministic component of physical model. However, this strategy necessitates knowledge of noise and resorts to auxiliary sampling methods for quantifying inverse uncertainty propagation. In this work, we develop the conditional pseudo-reversible normalizing flow model to directly learn and efficiently generate samples from the conditional probability density functions. The training process utilizes dataset consisting of input-output pairs without requiring prior knowledge about the noise and the function. Our model, once trained, can generate samples from any conditional probability density functions whose high probability regions are covered by the training set. Moreover, the pseudo-reversibility feature allows for the use of fully-connected neural network architectures, which simplifies the implementation and enables theoretical analysis. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the conditional pseudo-reversible normalizing flow model, showing its ability to converge to the target conditional probability density function using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to several benchmark tests and a real-world geologic carbon storage problem.">

        <tr id="In isogeometric analysis, isogeometric function spaces are employed for accurately representing the solution to a partial differential equation (PDE) on a parameterized domain. They are generated from a tensor-product spline space by composing the basis functions with the inverse of the parameterization. Depending on the geometry of the domain and on the data of the PDE, the solution might not have maximum Sobolev regularity, leading to a reduced convergence rate. In this case it is necessary to reduce the local mesh size close to the singularities. The classical approach is to perform adaptive h-refinement, which either leads to an unnecessarily large number of degrees of freedom or to a spline space that does not possess a tensor-product structure. Based on the concept of r-adaptivity we present a novel approach for finding a suitable isogeometric function space for a given PDE without sacrificing the tensor-product structure of the underlying spline space. In particular, we use the fact that different reparameterizations of the same computational domain lead to different isogeometric function spaces while preserving the geometry. Starting from a multi-patch domain consisting of bilinearly parameterized patches, we aim to find the biquadratic multi-patch parameterization that leads to the isogeometric function space with the smallest best approximation error of the solution. In order to estimate the location of the optimal control points, we employ a trained residual neural network that is applied to the graph surfaces of the approximated solution and its derivatives. In our experimental results, we observe that our new method results in a vast improvement of the approximation error for different PDE problems on multi-patch domains.">

In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime.

We demonstrate our technique on a toy example of training outlier-rejection weights for 3D point registration and on a real application of training an outlier-rejection and RANSAC sampling network in image matching. Our method provides $100\%$ stability and is 10 times faster compared to autograd, which is unstable and slow, and compared to DDN, which is stable but also slow.">

Effectiveness and robustness of the proposed adaptive CNN model are demonstrated through its performance in compliance minimization problems involving constant and design-dependent loads and in addressing bulk modulus optimization. Once trained, the model takes user's input of the volume fraction as an image and instantly generates an output image of optimized design. The proposed CNN produces high-quality results resembling those obtained via open-source TO codes with negligible performance and volume fraction errors.

Common features of these systems are that their behaviors are difficult to describe exactly and invariably unmodeled dynamics present challenges in making precise predictions.

In this paper, we present a novel data-driven linear estimator that uses Koopman operator theory to extract finite-dimensional representations of complex nonlinear systems. The extracted model is used together with a deep reinforcement learning network that learns the optimal stepwise actions to predict future states of the original nonlinear system. Our estimator is also adaptive to a diffeomorphic transformation of the nonlinear system which enables transfer learning to compute state estimates of the transformed system without relearning from scratch.">

Due to their inherent nonlinear dynamics and memory, they can learn unbounded temporal dependencies from data. In a Machine Learning setting, the network's parameters are adapted during a training phase to match the requirements of a given task/problem increasing its computational capabilities. After the training, the network parameters are kept fixed to exploit the learned computations. The static parameters thereby render the network unadaptive to changing conditions, such as external or internal perturbation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how keeping parts of the network adaptive even after the training enhances its functionality and robustness. Here, we utilize the conceptor framework and conceptualize an adaptive control loop analyzing the network's behavior continuously and adjusting its time-varying internal representation to follow a desired target. We demonstrate how the added adaptivity of the network supports the computational functionality in three distinct tasks: interpolation of temporal patterns, stabilization against partial network degradation, and robustness against input distortion. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive networks in machine learning beyond training, enabling them to not only learn complex patterns but also dynamically adjust to changing environments, ultimately broadening their applicability.">

Each reduced order model is composed of a nonlinear encoder-regressor-decoder architecture and is equipped with an adaptive update strategy that adds robustness for extrapolation. In doing so, the proposed methodology leverages physics-based insights from high-fidelity solvers, thus establishing a physics-aware machine learning predictor.

        <tr id="The majority of the results on modeling recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are obtained using delayed differential equations, which imply continuous time representation. On the other hand, these models must be discrete in time, given their practical implementation in computer systems, requiring their versatile utilization across arbitrary time scales. Hence, the goal of this research is to model and investigate the architecture design of a delayed RNN using delayed differential equations on a time scale. Internal memory can be utilized to describe the calculation of the future states using discrete and distributed delays, which is a representation of the deep learning architecture for artificial RNNs. We focus on qualitative behavior and stability study of the system. Special attention is paid to taking into account the effect of the time-scale parameters on neural network dynamics. Here, we delve into the exploration of exponential stability in RNN models on a time scale that incorporates multiple discrete and distributed delays. Two approaches for constructing exponential estimates, including the Hilger and the usual exponential functions, are considered and compared. The Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional method is employed to study stability on a time scale in both cases. The established stability criteria, resulting in an exponential-like estimate, utilizes a tuple of positive definite matrices, decay rate, and graininess of the time scale. The models of RNNs for the two-neuron network with four discrete and distributed delays, as well as the ring lattice delayed network of seven identical neurons, are numerically investigated. The results indicate how the time scale (graininess) and model characteristics (weights) influence the qualitative behavior, leading to a transition from stable focus to quasiperiodic limit cycles.">

The goal of this paper is to construct PINNs along with a computable upper bound of the error, which is particularly relevant for model reduction of Parameterized PDEs (PPDEs). To this end, we suggest to use a weighted sum of expansion coefficients of the residual in terms of an adaptive wavelet expansion both for the loss function and an error bound. This approach is shown here for elliptic PPDEs using both the standard variational and an optimally stable ultra-weak formulation.

This makes the training process challenging, especially for higher wave numbers. We show an example where these limitations are present. In order to improve the learning capability of our model, we suggest an equivalent formulation of the Helmholtz Boundary Value Problem (BVP) that is based on splitting the total wave into a tapered continuation of the incoming wave and a remaining scattered wave. This allows the introduction of an inhomogeneity in the BVP, leveraging the information transmitted during back-propagation, thus, enhancing and accelerating the training process of our PINN model. The presented numerical illustrations are in accordance with the expected behavior, paving the way to a possible alternative approach to predicting scattering problems using PINNs.">

        <tr id="Motivation Successfully predicting the development of biological systems can lead to advances in various research fields, such as cellular biology and epidemiology. While machine learning has proven its capabilities in generalizing the underlying non-linear dynamics of such systems, unlocking its predictive power is often restrained by the limited availability of large, curated datasets. To supplement real-world data, informing machine learning by transfer learning with data simulated from ordinary differential equations has emerged as a promising solution. However, the success of this approach highly depends on the designed characteristics of the synthetic data. Results We optimize dataset characteristics such as size, diversity, and noise of ordinary differential equation-based synthetic time series datasets in three relevant and representative biological systems. To achieve this, we here, for the first time, present a framework to systematically evaluate the influence of such design choices on transfer learning performance in one place. We achieve a performance improvement of up to 92% in mean absolute error for our optimized simulation-based transfer learning compared to non-informed deep learning. We find a strong interdependency between dataset size and diversity effects. The optimal transfer learning setting heavily relies on real-world data characteristics as well as its coherence with the synthetic data’s dynamics, emphasizing the relevance of such a framework.

In practice, the architecture of deep neural networks largely influences the performance of the models. However, most existing methodologies for designing neural architectures, such as the heuristic manual design or neural architecture search, ignore the universal approximation property, thus losing a potential safeguard about the performance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to design the architectures of deep neural networks with a universality guarantee based on first-order optimization algorithms, where the forward pass is interpreted as the updates of an optimization algorithm. The (explicit or implicit) network is designed by replacing each gradient term in the algorithm with a learnable module similar to a two-layer network or its derivatives Specifically, we explore the realm of width-bounded neural networks, a common practical scenario, showcasing their universality. Moreover, adding operations of normalization, downsampling, and upsampling does not hurt the universality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that width-bounded networks with universal approximation guarantee can be designed in a principled way. Our framework can inspire a variety of neural architectures including some renowned structures such as ResNet and DenseNet, as well as novel innovations. The experimental results on image classification problems demonstrate that the newly inspired networks are competitive and surpass the baselines of ResNet, DenseNet, as well as the advanced ConvNeXt and ViT, testifying to the effectiveness of our framework.">

To address these challenges, researchers design complex pre-processing methods for each observation type, leveraging approximate modeling and the power of super-computing clusters to expedite solutions. The emergence of deep learning (DL) models has been a game-changer, offering unified multi-modal modeling, enhanced nonlinear representation capabilities, and superior parallelization.

        <tr id="The Lipschitz constant plays a crucial role in certifying the robustness of neural networks to input perturbations and adversarial attacks, as well as the stability and safety of systems with neural network controllers. Therefore, estimation of tight bounds on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks is a well-studied topic. However, typical approaches involve solving a large matrix verification problem, the computational cost of which grows significantly for deeper networks. In this letter, we provide a compositional approach to estimate Lipschitz constants for deep feedforward neural networks by obtaining an exact decomposition of the large matrix verification problem into smaller sub-problems. We further obtain a closed-form solution that applies to most common neural network activation functions, which will enable rapid robustness and stability certificates for neural networks deployed in online control settings. Finally, we demonstrate through numerical experiments that our approach provides a steep reduction in computation time while yielding Lipschitz bounds that are very close to those achieved by state-of-the-art approaches.">

Here, we investigated network shapes, sizes, and types for unsupervised physics-informed deep learning of the two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged flow around cylinders. We trained mixed-variable networks and compared them to traditional models. Several network architectures with different shape factors and sizes were evaluated. The models were trained to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations incorporating Prandtl’s mixing length turbulence model. No training data were deployed to train the models. The superiority of the mixed-variable approach was confirmed for the investigated high Reynolds number flow. The mixed-variable models were sensitive to the network shape. For the two cylinders, differently deep networks showed superior performance. The best fitting models were able to capture important flow phenomena such as stagnation regions, boundary layers, flow separation, and recirculation. We also encountered difficulties when predicting high Reynolds number flows without training data.">

In detail, we first implement a differentiable thermal model based on a lumped parameter thermal network within an automatic differentiation framework. Subsequently, we add a neural network to predict thermal resistances, capacitances, and losses in real time and utilize the thermal parameters’ optimized empirical values as the initial output values of the network to improve the accuracy and robustness of the final temperature estimation. We validate the conceivable advantages of the proposed method through extensive experiments based on both synthetic data and real-world data and then provide some further potential applications.">

In this paper, we propose a generalized high-dimensional analysis for nonlinear regression models, including various nonlinear feature mapping methods and subsampling. Specifically, we first provide an implicit regularization parameter and asymptotic equivalents related to a classical complexity notion, i.e., effective dimension. We then present a high-dimensional analysis for nonlinear ridge regression and extend it to ridgeless regression in the under-parameterized and over-parameterized regimes, respectively. We find that the limiting risks decrease with the effective dimension. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose an algorithm, namely RFRed, to improve generalization ability. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings and the proposed algorithm through several experiments.">

        <tr id="Linearity of Koopman operators and simplicity of their estimators coupled with model-reduction capabilities has lead to their great popularity in applications for learning dynamical systems. While nonparametric Koopman operator learning in infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is well understood for autonomous systems, its control system analogues are largely unexplored. Addressing systems with control inputs in a principled manner is crucial for fully data-driven learning of controllers, especially since existing approaches commonly resort to representational heuristics or parametric models of limited expressiveness and scalability. We address the aforementioned challenge by proposing a universal framework via control-affine reproducing kernels that enables direct estimation of a single operator even for control systems. The proposed approach, called control-Koopman operator regression (cKOR), is thus completely analogous to Koopman operator regression of the autonomous case. First in the literature, we present a nonparametric framework for learning Koopman operator representations of nonlinear control-affine systems that does not suffer from the curse of control input dimensionality. This allows for reformulating the infinite-dimensional learning problem in a finite-dimensional space based solely on data without apriori loss of precision due to a restriction to a finite span of functions or inputs as in other approaches. For enabling applications to large-scale control systems, we also enhance the scalability of control-Koopman operator estimators by leveraging random projections (sketching). The efficacy of our novel cKOR approach is demonstrated on both forecasting and control tasks.">

Our second result gives new analysis on the covering number of feed-forward neural networks with CNNs as special cases. The analysis carefully takes into account the size of the weights and hence gives better bounds than the existing literature in some situations. Using these two results, we are able to derive rates of convergence for estimators based on CNNs in many learning problems. In particular, we establish minimax optimal convergence rates of the least squares based on CNNs for learning smooth functions in the nonparametric regression setting. For binary classification, we derive convergence rates for CNN classifiers with hinge loss and logistic loss. It is also shown that the obtained rates for classification are minimax optimal in some common settings.">

Based on an attentional multi-conditioning strategy, our method also allows non-recurrent supervision on and prediction of intermediate physical states, which provides improved generalization with no additional data-generation cost. Using this O(1)-time intermediate prediction capability, we propose and prove a rigorous, efficiently computable upper bound on prediction error, allowing accuracy guarantees at inference time for all predictions. After training solely on randomized systems, we demonstrate the unified model across a suite of challenging multi-disciplinary inverse problems, finding strong efficacy and speed improvements up to 96% for problems in optical tomography, beam shaping through volumetric random media, and freeform photonic inverse design, with no problem-specific training. Our findings demonstrate a path to universal, verifiably accurate neural surrogates for existing scattering simulators, and our conditioning and training methods are directly applicable to any PDE admitting a time-domain iterative solver.">

In this limit, the learning problem is reduced to the minimization problem over the intrinsic kernel. Then, we show the global convergence of the mean-field Langevin dynamics and derive time and particle discretization error. We also demonstrate that two-layer neural networks can learn a union of multiple reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces more efficiently than any kernel methods, and neural networks acquire data-dependent kernel which aligns with the target function. In addition, we develop a label noise procedure, which converges to the global optimum and show that the degrees of freedom appears as an implicit regularization.">

The proposed model benefits from the physics-based knowledge contained in the constitutive models used in the full-order micromodel by embedding them in a neural network. Following previous developments, this paper extends the applicability of the physically recurrent neural network (PRNN) by introducing an architecture suitable for rate-dependent materials in a finite strain framework. In this model, the homogenized deformation gradient of the micromodel is encoded into a set of deformation gradients serving as input to the embedded constitutive models. These constitutive models compute stresses, which are combined in a decoder to predict the homogenized stress, such that the internal variables of the history-dependent constitutive models naturally provide physics-based memory for the network. To demonstrate the capabilities of the surrogate model, we consider a unidirectional composite micromodel with transversely isotropic elastic fibers and elasto-viscoplastic matrix material. The extrapolation properties of the surrogate model trained to replace such micromodel are tested on loading scenarios unseen during training, ranging from different strain-rates to cyclic loading and relaxation. Speed-ups of three orders of magnitude with respect to the runtime of the original micromodel are obtained.">

This violation can lead to suboptimal model performance when optimizing empirical risk without access to future data, resulting in overfitting on the training data and convergence to a single sharp minimum. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model updating framework called Slow and Fast Trajectory Learning (SFTL) network. SFTL aims to mitigate the discrepancy between past and future domains while quickly adapting to recent changes in small temporal drifts. This mechanism entails two interactions among three complementary learners: (i) the Working Learner, which updates model parameters using modern optimizers (e.g., Adam, Adagrad) and serves as the primary learner in the recommendation system, (ii) the Slow Learner, which is updated in each temporal domain by directly assigning the model weights of the working learner, and (iii) the Fast Learner, which is updated in each iteration by assigning exponentially moving average weights of the working learner. Additionally, we propose a novel rank-based trajectory loss to facilitate interaction between the working learner and trajectory learner, aiming to adapt to temporal drift and enhance performance in the current domain compared to the past. We provide theoretical understanding and conduct extensive experiments on real-world CTR prediction datasets to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of SFTL in terms of both convergence speed and model performance. The results demonstrate the superiority of SFTL over existing approaches.">

In this work, we investigate this problem from an information theoretic perspective and show that most existing measures of explainability may suffer from trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet practical objective function for time series explainable learning. The design of the objective function builds upon the principle of information bottleneck (IB), and modifies the IB objective function to avoid trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. We further present TimeX++, a novel explanation framework that leverages a parametric network to produce explanation-embedded instances that are both in-distributed and label-preserving. We evaluate TimeX++ on both synthetic and real-world datasets comparing its performance against leading baselines, and validate its practical efficacy through case studies in a real-world environmental application. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that TimeX++ outperforms baselines across all datasets, demonstrating a substantial improvement in explanation quality for time series data.

It was shown by Han and Long (2020) that the errors induced by the deep BSDE method admit a posteriori estimate depending on the loss function, whenever the backward equation only couples into the forward diffusion through the Y process. We generalize this result to fully-coupled drift coefficients, and give sufficient conditions for convergence under standard assumptions. The resulting conditions are directly verifiable for any equation. Consequently, unlike in earlier theory, our convergence analysis enables the treatment of FBSDEs stemming from stochastic optimal control problems. In particular, we provide a theoretical justification for the non-convergence of the deep BSDE method observed in recent literature, and present direct guidelines for when convergence can be guaranteed in practice. Our theoretical findings are supported by several numerical experiments in high-dimensional settings.">

While early methods in this domain only focused on learning in the functional domain, the latest techniques have demonstrated that by promoting consistency between functional and pointwise maps leads to significant improvements in accuracy. Unfortunately, existing approaches rely heavily on the computation of large dense matrices arising from soft pointwise maps, which compromises their efficiency and scalability. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel memory-scalable and efficient functional map learning pipeline. By leveraging the specific structure of functional maps, we offer the possibility to achieve identical results without ever storing the pointwise map in memory. Furthermore, based on the same approach, we present a differentiable map refinement layer adapted from an existing axiomatic refinement algorithm. Unlike many functional map learning methods, which use this algorithm at a post-processing step, ours can be easily used at train time, enabling to enforce consistency between the refined and initial versions of the map. Our resulting approach is both simpler, more efficient and more numerically stable, by avoiding differentiation through a linear system, while achieving close to state-of-the-art results in challenging scenarios.">

        <tr id="The discretization of the deep Ritz method [18] for the Poisson equation leads to a high-dimensional non-convex minimization problem, that is difficult and expensive to solve numerically. In this paper, we consider the shallow Ritz approximation to one-dimensional diffusion problems and introduce an effective and efficient iterative method, a damped block Newton (dBN) method, for solving the resulting non-convex minimization problem. The method employs the block Gauss-Seidel method as an outer iteration by dividing the parameters of a shallow neural network into the linear parameters (the weights and bias of the output layer) and the non-linear parameters (the weights and bias of the hidden layer). Per each outer iteration, the linear and the non-linear parameters are updated by exact inversion and one step of a damped Newton method, respectively. Inverses of the coefficient matrix and the Hessian matrix are tridiagonal and diagonal, respectively, and hence the cost of each dBN iteration is $\mathcal{O}(n)$. To move the breakpoints (the non-linear parameters) more efficiently, we propose an adaptive damped block Newton (AdBN) method by combining the dBN with the adaptive neuron enhancement (ANE) method [25]. Numerical examples demonstrate the ability of dBN and AdBN not only to move the breakpoints quickly and efficiently but also to achieve a nearly optimal order of convergence for AdBN. These iterative solvers are capable of outperforming BFGS for select examples.">

Despite tremendous efforts, a neural network architecture with the ability to high-accurately solve these fully connected and extremely intractable problems on larger systems is still lacking. Here we propose a variational autoregressive architecture with a message passing mechanism, which can effectively utilize the interactions between spin variables. The new network trained under an annealing framework outperforms existing methods in solving several prototypical Ising spin Hamiltonians, especially for larger spin systems at low temperatures. The advantages also come from the great mitigation of mode collapse during the training process of deep neural networks.

Within the landscape of modular approaches, a bio-inspired neural circuit policy model has emerged as an innovative control module, offering a compact and inherently interpretable system to infer a steering wheel command from abstract visual features. Here, we take a leap forward by integrating a variational autoencoder with the neural circuit policy controller, forming a solution that directly generates steering commands from input camera images. By substituting the traditional convolutional neural network approach to feature extraction with a variational autoencoder, we enhance the system's interpretability, enabling a more transparent and understandable decision-making process. In addition to the architectural shift toward a variational autoencoder, this study introduces the automatic latent perturbation tool, a novel contribution designed to probe and elucidate the latent features within the variational autoencoder. The automatic latent perturbation tool automates the interpretability process, offering granular insights into how specific latent variables influence the overall model's behavior. Through a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate the interpretative power of the variational autoencoder-neural circuit policy model and the utility of the automatic latent perturbation tool in making the inner workings of autonomous driving systems more transparent.">

Structural rigidity limits the ability to optimize parameters of policies across multiple environments that do not share input and output spaces.

During optimization, the parameters of these fundamental units of a neural network are optimized in different random structural configurations. Earlier work has shown that parameter sharing between units is important for making structurally flexible neurons We show that it is possible to optimize a set of distinct neuron- and synapse types allowing for a mitigation of the symmetry dilemma.

Our approach consists of a topology neural network that optimizes the microstructure shape and distribution across the design domain as a continuous field. Each microstructure cell is optimized based on a specified elasticity tensor that also accommodates in-plane rotations. The neural network takes as input the local coordinates within a cell to represent the density distribution within a cell, as well as the global coordinates of each cell to design spatially varying microstructure cells. As such, our approach models an n-dimensional multi-scale optimization problem as a 2n-dimensional inverse homogenization problem using neural networks. During the inverse homogenization of each unit cell, we extend the boundary of each cell by scaling the input coordinates such that the boundaries of neighboring cells are combined. Inverse homogenization on the combined cell improves connectivity. We demonstrate our method through the design and optimization of graded multi-scale structures.">

However, tracking and forecasting such data streams poses a significant challenge to most methods, as they assume the underlying process and model does not change over time. In this paper, we apply one such data-driven method, the Koopman autoencoder (KAE), to high-dimensional oscillatory data to generate a low-dimensional latent space and model, where the system's dynamics appear linear. This allows one to accurately track and forecast systems where the underlying model may change over time. States and the model in the reduced order latent space can then be efficiently updated as new data becomes available, using data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), in a technique we call the KAE EnKF. We demonstrate that this approach is able to effectively track and forecast time-varying, nonlinear dynamical systems in synthetic examples. We then apply the KAE EnKF to a video of a physical pendulum, and achieve a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. By generating effective latent space reconstructions, we find that we are able to construct accurate short-term forecasts and efficient adaptations to externally forced changes to the pendulum's frequency.">

Despite integrating both data and underlying physics to enrich the neural network's understanding, concerns regarding the effectiveness and practicality of PINNs persist. Over the past few years, extensive efforts in the current literature have been made to enhance this evolving method, by drawing inspiration from both machine learning algorithms and numerical methods. Despite notable progressions in PINNs algorithms, the important and fundamental field of data preprocessing remain unexplored, limiting the applications of PINNs especially in solving inverse problems. Therefore in this paper, a concise yet potent data preprocessing method focusing on data normalization was proposed. By applying a linear transformation to both the data and corresponding equations concurrently, the normalized PINNs approach was evaluated on the task of reconstructing flow fields in three turbulent cases. The results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, illustrate that by adhering to the data preprocessing procedure, PINNs can robustly achieve higher prediction accuracy for all flow quantities through the entire training process, distinctly improving the utilization of limited training data. The proposed normalization method requires zero extra computational cost. Though only verified in Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, this method holds potential for application to various other equations.">

        <tr id="Deep learning techniques have shown significant potential in many applications through recent years. The achieved results often outperform traditional techniques. However, the quality of a neural network highly depends on the used training data. Noisy, insufficient, or biased training data leads to suboptimal results. We present a hybrid method that combines deep learning with iterated graph Laplacian and show its application in acoustic impedance inversion which is a routine procedure in seismic explorations. A neural network is used to obtain a first approximation of the underlying acoustic impedance and construct a graph Laplacian matrix from this approximation. Afterwards, we use a Tikhonov-like variational method to solve the impedance inversion problem where the regularizer is based on the constructed graph Laplacian. The obtained solution can be shown to be more accurate and stable with respect to noise than the initial guess obtained by the neural network. This process can be iterated several times, each time constructing a new graph Laplacian matrix from the most recent reconstruction. The method converges after only a few iterations returning a much more accurate reconstruction. We demonstrate the potential of our method on two different datasets and under various levels of noise. We use two different neural networks that have been introduced in previous works. The experiments show that our approach improves the reconstruction quality in the presence of noise.">

Additionally, the long‐short‐term memory machine learning (LSTM‐ML) approach is used in this study to examine the periodic fluctuation in the temperature of the fin. The current research is devoted to solving the highly non‐linear equation using a physics‐informed neural network (PINN) approach. Using the proper dimensionless terms, the associated fin problem is transformed into a non‐dimensional system, and the resulting partial differential equation (PDE) is then numerically solved using the finite difference method (FDM). Using the data‐driven LSTM‐ML technique, the time‐dependent periodic heat transmission in the concave fin is also examined. The impact of various factors on the temperature profile of the concave extended surface is explained, and the results are visually displayed. The temperature distribution in the concave fin diminishes as the convection‐conduction parameter and radiation‐conduction parameter rise. As the amplitude and thermal conductivity parameters improve, so does the temperature of the concave fin. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that although LSTM‐ML and PINN closely matched the FDM findings during the training domain, only PINN with designed characteristics has the potential to predict accurately beyond the trained region by capturing the physics of the problem.">

Altering loss functions or adding physics-based regularization (PBR) terms to reflect material properties informs a network about the physical constraints the simulation should obey. The training and tuning process of a DL network greatly affects the quality of the model, but how this process differs when using physics-based loss functions or regularization terms is not commonly discussed. In this manuscript, several PBR methods are implemented to enforce stress equilibrium on a network predicting the stress fields of a high elastic contrast composite. Models with PBR enforced the equilibrium constraint more accurately than a model without PBR, and the stress equilibrium converged more quickly. More importantly it was observed that independently fine-tuning each implementation resulted in more accurate models. More specifically each loss formulation and dataset required different learning rates and loss weights for the best performance. This result has important implications on assessing the relative effectiveness of different DL models and highlights important considerations when making a comparison between DL methods.">

The input layer incorporates multiquadric (MQ) RBFs, symbolizing the radial distance between the boundary points on the spacetime boundary and the source points positioned outside the spacetime boundary. The output layer is the initial and boundary data given by analytical solutions of the diffusion equation. Utilizing the concept of the spacetime coordinates, the approximations for forward and backward diffusion problems involve assigning initial data on the bottom or top spacetime boundaries, respectively. As the need for discretization of the governing equation is eliminated, our straightforward approach uses only the provided boundary data and MQ RBFs. To validate the proposed method, various diffusion scenarios, including forward, backward, and inverse problems with noise, are examined. Results indicate that the method can achieve high-precision numerical solutions for solving diffusion problems. Notably, only 1/4 of the initial and boundary conditions are known, yet the method still yields precise results.">

        <tr id="Identifying latent interactions within complex systems is key to unlocking deeper insights into their operational dynamics, including how their elements affect each other and contribute to the overall system behavior. For instance, in neuroscience, discovering neuron-to-neuron interactions is essential for understanding brain function; in ecology, recognizing the interactions among populations is key for understanding complex ecosystems. Such systems, often modeled as dynamical systems, typically exhibit noisy high-dimensional and non-stationary temporal behavior that renders their identification challenging. Existing dynamical system identification methods often yield operators that accurately capture short-term behavior but fail to predict long-term trends, suggesting an incomplete capture of the underlying process. Methods that consider extended forecasts (e.g., recurrent neural networks) lack explicit representations of element-wise interactions and require substantial training data, thereby failing to capture interpretable network operators. Here we introduce Lookahead-driven Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability (LINOCS), a robust learning procedure for identifying hidden dynamical interactions in noisy time-series data. LINOCS integrates several multi-step predictions with adaptive weights during training to recover dynamical operators that can yield accurate long-term predictions. We demonstrate LINOCS' ability to recover the ground truth dynamical operators underlying synthetic time-series data for multiple dynamical systems models (including linear, piece-wise linear, time-changing linear systems' decomposition, and regularized linear time-varying systems) as well as its capability to produce meaningful operators with robust reconstructions through various real-world examples.">

The uniform regularity estimates are obtained by the stochastic maximum principle and the analysis of a backward stochastic Riccati equation. Using these uniform regularity results, we show the convergence of the minima of objective functionals and optimal parameters of the neural SDEs as the sample size N tends to infinity.

In this paper, we derive a PAC bound for stable continuous-time linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems.

        <tr id="Turning pass-through network architectures into iterative ones, which use their own output as input, is a well-known approach for boosting performance. In this paper, we argue that such architectures offer an additional benefit: The convergence rate of their successive outputs is highly correlated with the accuracy of the value to which they converge. Thus, we can use the convergence rate as a useful proxy for uncertainty. This results in an approach to uncertainty estimation that provides state-of-the-art estimates at a much lower computational cost than techniques like Ensembles, and without requiring any modifications to the original iterative model. We demonstrate its practical value by embedding it in two application domains: road detection in aerial images and the estimation of aerodynamic properties of 2D and 3D shapes.">

        <tr id="Neural networks typically exhibit permutation symmetries which contribute to the non-convexity of the networks' loss landscapes, since linearly interpolating between two permuted versions of a trained network tends to encounter a high loss barrier. Recent work has argued that permutation symmetries are the only sources of non-convexity, meaning there are essentially no such barriers between trained networks if they are permuted appropriately. In this work, we refine these arguments into three distinct claims of increasing strength. We show that existing evidence only supports"weak linear connectivity"-that for each pair of networks belonging to a set of SGD solutions, there exist (multiple) permutations that linearly connect it with the other networks. In contrast, the claim"strong linear connectivity"-that for each network, there exists one permutation that simultaneously connects it with the other networks-is both intuitively and practically more desirable. This stronger claim would imply that the loss landscape is convex after accounting for permutation, and enable linear interpolation between three or more independently trained models without increased loss. In this work, we introduce an intermediate claim-that for certain sequences of networks, there exists one permutation that simultaneously aligns matching pairs of networks from these sequences. Specifically, we discover that a single permutation aligns sequences of iteratively trained as well as iteratively pruned networks, meaning that two networks exhibit low loss barriers at each step of their optimization and sparsification trajectories respectively. Finally, we provide the first evidence that strong linear connectivity may be possible under certain conditions, by showing that barriers decrease with increasing network width when interpolating among three networks.">

Numerical approximation of these PDEs is a challenging task that can be addressed, for example, by multi-scale finite element analysis. For linear problems, multi-scale finite element method (MsFEM) is well established and some viable extensions to non-linear PDEs are known. However, some features of the method seem to be intrinsically based on linearity-based. In particular, traditional MsFEM rely on the reuse of computations. For example, the stiffness matrix can be calculated just once, while being used for several right-hand sides, or as part of a multi-level iterative algorithm. Roughly speaking, the offline phase of the method amounts to pre-assembling the local linear Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operators. We present some preliminary results concerning the combination of MsFEM with machine learning tools. The extension of MsFEM to nonlinear problems is achieved by means of learning local nonlinear DtN maps. The resulting learning-based multi-scale method is tested on a set of model nonlinear PDEs involving the $p-$Laplacian and degenerate nonlinear diffusion.">

In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we advance the understanding of neural network training dynamics by examining the intricate interplay of various factors introduced by weight parameters in the initialization process. Motivated by the foundational work of Luo et al. (J. Mach. Learn. Res., Vol. 22, Iss. 1, No. 71, pp 3327-3373), we explore the gradient descent dynamics of neural networks through the lens of macroscopic limits, where we analyze its behavior as width $m$ tends to infinity. Our study presents a unified approach with refined techniques designed for multi-layer fully connected neural networks, which can be readily extended to other neural network architectures. Our investigation reveals that gradient descent can rapidly drive deep neural networks to zero training loss, irrespective of the specific initialization schemes employed by weight parameters, provided that the initial scale of the output function $\kappa$ surpasses a certain threshold. This regime, characterized as the theta-lazy area, accentuates the predominant influence of the initial scale $\kappa$ over other factors on the training behavior of neural networks. Furthermore, our approach draws inspiration from the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) paradigm, and we expand its applicability. While NTK typically assumes that $\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{\log \kappa}{\log m}=\frac{1}{2}$, and imposes each weight parameters to scale by the factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}$, in our theta-lazy regime, we discard the factor and relax the conditions to $\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{\log \kappa}{\log m}>0$. Similar to NTK, the behavior of overparameterized neural networks within the theta-lazy regime trained by gradient descent can be effectively described by a specific kernel. Through rigorous analysis, our investigation illuminates the pivotal role of $\kappa$ in governing the training dynamics of neural networks.">

However, polynomial combinations factored by the Laplacian matrix naturally have limitations in message passing (e.g., over-smoothing). Furthermore, most existing spectral GNNs are based on polynomial bases, which struggle to capture the high-frequency parts of the graph spectral signal. Additionally, we also find that even increasing the polynomial order does not change this situation, which means polynomial-based models have a natural deficiency when facing high-frequency signals. To tackle these problems, we propose WaveNet, which aims to effectively capture the high-frequency part of the graph spectral signal from the perspective of wavelet bases through reconstructing the message propagation matrix. We utilize Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) to model this question, and our proposed method can reconstruct arbitrary filters theoretically.

        <tr id="The growing availability and importance of time series data across various domains, including environmental science, epidemiology, and economics, has led to an increasing need for time-series causal discovery methods that can identify the intricate relationships in the non-stationary, non-linear, and often noisy real world data. However, the majority of current time series causal discovery methods assume stationarity and linear relations in data, making them infeasible for the task. Further, the recent deep learning-based methods rely on the traditional causal structure learning approaches making them computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a Time-Series Causal Neural Network (TS-CausalNN) - a deep learning technique to discover contemporaneous and lagged causal relations simultaneously. Our proposed architecture comprises (i) convolutional blocks comprising parallel custom causal layers, (ii) acyclicity constraint, and (iii) optimization techniques using the augmented Lagrangian approach. In addition to the simple parallel design, an advantage of the proposed model is that it naturally handles the non-stationarity and non-linearity of the data. Through experiments on multiple synthetic and real world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical proficiency of our proposed approach as compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The inferred graphs for the real world dataset are in good agreement with the domain understanding.">

We demonstrate, starting from the logistic model structure, that classical, delayed, and fractional models are special cases of a framework using a gamma Mittag-Leffler memory kernel. We discuss and classify different types of this general kernel, analyze the asymptotic behavior of the general model, and provide numerical simulations. A detailed classification of the memory kernels is presented through parameter analysis. The fractional models we constructed possess distinctive features as they maintain dimensional balance and explicitly relate fractional orders to past data points. Additionally, we illustrate how our models can reproduce the dynamics of COVID-19 infections in Australia, Brazil, and Peru. Our research expands mathematical modeling by presenting a unified framework that facilitates the incorporation of historical data through the utilization of integro-differential equations, fractional or delayed differential equations, as well as classical systems of ordinary differential equations.">

        <tr id="This article concerns the investigation on the consensus problem for the joint state-uncertainty estimation of a class of parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems with parametric and nonparametric uncertainties. We propose a two-layer network consisting of informed and uninformed boundary observers where novel adaptation laws are developed for the identification of uncertainties. Particularly, all observer agents in the network transmit their information with each other across the entire network. The proposed adaptation laws include a penalty term of the mismatch between the parameter estimates generated by the other observer agents. Moreover, for the nonparametric uncertainties, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks are employed for the universal approximation of unknown nonlinear functions. Given the persistently exciting condition, it is shown that the proposed network of adaptive observers can achieve exponential joint state-uncertainty estimation in the presence of parametric uncertainties and ultimate bounded estimation in the presence of nonparametric uncertainties based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The effects of the proposed consensus method are demonstrated through a typical reaction-diffusion system example, which implies convincing numerical findings.">

Considering a local subdomain with corresponding oversampling domain we prove the compactness of the transfer operator which maps boundary data to solutions on the interior domain. While a Caccioppoli-inequality quantifying the energy decay to the interior holds true for all Friedrichs' systems, showing a compactness result for the graph-spaces hosting the solution is additionally necessary. We discuss the mixed formulation of a convection-diffusion-reaction problem where the necessary compactness result is obtained by the Picard-Weck-Weber theorem. Our numerical results, focusing on a scenario involving heterogeneous diffusion fields with multiple high-conductivity channels, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.">

In this regime the set of global minimizers of the loss is large, and when initialized in a neighbourhood of this zero-loss set a noisy gradient descent algorithm slowly evolves along this set. In some cases this slow evolution has been related to better generalisation properties. We characterize this evolution for the broad class of noisy gradient descent systems in the limit of small step size. Our results show that the structure of the noise affects not just the form of the limiting process, but also the time scale at which the evolution takes place. We apply the theory to Dropout, label noise and classical SGD (minibatching) noise, and show that these evolve on different two time scales. Classical SGD even yields a trivial evolution on both time scales, implying that additional noise is required for regularization. The results are inspired by the training of neural networks, but the theorems apply to noisy gradient descent of any loss that has a non-trivial zero-loss set.">

        <tr id="We consider a large class of shallow neural networks with randomly initialized parameters and rectified linear unit activation functions. We prove that these random neural networks are well-defined non-Gaussian processes. As a by-product, we demonstrate that these networks are solutions to stochastic differential equations driven by impulsive white noise (combinations of random Dirac measures). These processes are parameterized by the law of the weights and biases as well as the density of activation thresholds in each bounded region of the input domain. We prove that these processes are isotropic and wide-sense self-similar with Hurst exponent $3/2$. We also derive a remarkably simple closed-form expression for their autocovariance function. Our results are fundamentally different from prior work in that we consider a non-asymptotic viewpoint: The number of neurons in each bounded region of the input domain (i.e., the width) is itself a random variable with a Poisson law with mean proportional to the density parameter. Finally, we show that, under suitable hypotheses, as the expected width tends to infinity, these processes can converge in law not only to Gaussian processes, but also to non-Gaussian processes depending on the law of the weights. Our asymptotic results provide a new take on several classical results (wide networks converge to Gaussian processes) as well as some new ones (wide networks can converge to non-Gaussian processes).">

More specifically, we tackle the problem of imposing asymptotic stability to a Koopman matrix learned from data during iterative gradient descent optimization processes. We show that this sufficient condition can be decoupled by rows of the system matrix, and propose a control barrier function-based projected gradient descent to enforce gradual evolution towards the stability set by running an optimization-in-the-loop during the iterative learning process. We compare the performance of our algorithm with other two recent approaches in the literature, and show that we get close to state-of-the-art performance while providing the added flexibility of allowing the optimization problem to be further customized for specific applications.">

While there's growing evidence suggesting that models trained with backprop can accurately explain neuronal data, no backprop-like method has yet been discovered in the biological brain for learning. Moreover, employing a naive implementation of backprop in the brain has several drawbacks. In 2022, Geoffrey Hinton proposed a biologically plausible learning method known as the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm. Shortly after this paper, a modified version called FFCL was introduced. However, FFCL had limitations, notably being a three-stage learning system where the final stage still relied on regular backpropagation. In our approach, we address these drawbacks by eliminating the last two stages of FFCL and completely removing regular backpropagation. Instead, we rely solely on local updates, offering a more biologically plausible alternative.">

A common architecture uses a neural network with a single hidden layer (i.e. a shallow network), in which the weights and biases are fixed in advance and only the output layer is trained. While classical results show that there exist neural networks of this type that can approximate arbitrary continuous functions over bounded regions, they are non-constructive, and the networks used in practice have no approximation guarantees. Thus, the approximation properties required for control with neural networks are assumed, rather than proved. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by showing that for sufficiently smooth functions, ReLU networks with randomly generated weights and biases achieve $L_{\infty}$ error of $O(m^{-1/2})$ with high probability, where $m$ is the number of neurons. It suffices to generate the weights uniformly over a sphere and the biases uniformly over an interval.

        <tr id="High-dimensional longitudinal time series data is prevalent across various real-world applications. Many such applications can be modeled as regression problems with high-dimensional time series covariates. Deep learning has been a popular and powerful tool for fitting these regression models. Yet, the development of interpretable and reproducible deep-learning models is challenging and remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel method, Deep Learning Inference using Knockoffs for Time series data (DeepLINK-T), focusing on the selection of significant time series variables in regression while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a predetermined level. DeepLINK-T combines deep learning with knockoff inference to control FDR in feature selection for time series models, accommodating a wide variety of feature distributions. It addresses dependencies across time and features by leveraging a time-varying latent factor structure in time series covariates. Three key ingredients for DeepLINK-T are 1) a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder for generating time series knockoff variables, 2) an LSTM prediction network using both original and knockoff variables, and 3) the application of the knockoffs framework for variable selection with FDR control. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate DeepLINK-T's performance, showing its capability to control FDR effectively while demonstrating superior feature selection power for high-dimensional longitudinal time series data compared to its non-time series counterpart. DeepLINK-T is further applied to three metagenomic data sets, validating its practical utility and effectiveness, and underscoring its potential in real-world applications.">

Due to the scarcity of sufficiently labelled real waveform data, we generate our own synthetic dataset to train the model.

The application to real data involves a deconvolution step to homogenize the waveforms.

Through this analysis, this paper introduces a comprehensive set of criteria designed to evaluate the capability of ANNs in this context. These criteria include the minimization of losses, the permutability of particle indices, the ability to predict trajectories recursively, the conservation of particles, the model’s handling of boundary conditions, and its scalability. Each network type is systematically examined to determine its strengths and weaknesses in adhering to these criteria. While, predictably, none of the networks fully meets all criteria, this study extends beyond the simple conclusion that only by integrating physics-based models into ANNs is it possible to fully replicate complex particle trajectories. Instead, it probes and delineates the extent to which various neural networks can “understand” and interpret aspects of the underlying physics, with each criterion targeting a distinct aspect of this understanding.">

Our objective is to design the optimal controller using limited data from the \textit{target system} (the system of interest). To this end, we employ an implicit model-agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) framework that leverages information from \textit{source systems} (systems that share similarities with the target system) to expedite training in the target system and enhance its control performance. The framework consists of two phases: the (offine) meta-training phase learns a aggregated NSSM using data from source systems, and the (online) meta-inference phase quickly adapts this aggregated model to the target system using only a few data points and few online training iterations, based on local loss function gradients. The iMAML algorithm exploits the implicit function theorem to exactly compute the gradient during training, without relying on the entire optimization path. By focusing solely on the optimal solution, rather than the path, we can meta-train with less storage complexity and fewer approximations than other contemporary meta-learning algorithms. We demonstrate through numerical examples that our proposed method can yield accurate predictive models by adaptation, resulting in a downstream MPC that outperforms several baselines.">

        <tr id="Inverse problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Many of these are naturally formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. These non-linear, large-scale, constrained optimization problems know many challenges, of which the inherent non-linearity of the problem is an important one. As an alternative to this physics-driven approach, data-driven methods have been proposed. These methods come with their own set of challenges, and it appears that, ideally, one would devise hybrid methods that combine the best of both worlds. In this paper, we propose one way of combining PDE-constrained optimization with recently proposed data-driven reduced-order models. Starting from an infinite-dimensional formulation of the inverse problem with discrete data, we propose a general framework for the analysis and discretisation of such problems. The proposed approach is based on a relaxed formulation of the PDE-constrained optimization problem, which reduces to a weighted non-linear least-squares problem. The weight matrix turns out to be the Gram matrix of solutions of the PDE, and it can be estimated directly from the measurements. We provide a number of representative case studies and numerical examples.">

        <tr id="Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.">

        <tr id="Deep-Learning-based Variational Monte Carlo (DL-VMC) has recently emerged as a highly accurate approach for finding approximate solutions to the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation. Despite its favorable scaling with the number of electrons, $\mathcal{O}(n_\text{el}^{4})$, the practical value of DL-VMC is limited by the high cost of optimizing the neural network weights for every system studied. To mitigate this problem, recent research has proposed optimizing a single neural network across multiple systems, reducing the cost per system. Here we extend this approach to solids, where similar but distinct calculations using different geometries, boundary conditions, and supercell sizes are often required. We show how to optimize a single ansatz across all of these variations, reducing the required number of optimization steps by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we exploit the transfer capabilities of a pre-trained network. We successfully transfer a network, pre-trained on 2x2x2 supercells of LiH, to 3x3x3 supercells. This reduces the number of optimization steps required to simulate the large system by a factor of 50 compared to previous work.">

The challenge remains in providing estimations for transitional properties pertaining to the system's vector fields based on discrete-time observations. To retrieve such infinitesimal system transition information, leveraging the structure of Koopman operator learning, current literature focuses on developing techniques free of time derivatives through the use of the Koopman operator logarithm. However, the soundness of these methods has so far been demonstrated only for maintaining effectiveness within a restrictive function space, together with knowledge of the operator spectrum properties. To better adapt to the practical applications in learning and control of unknown systems, we propose a logarithm-free technique for learning the infinitesimal generator without disrupting the Koopman operator learning framework. This approach claims compatibility with other system verification tools using the same set of training data. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness in applications of system identification and stability prediction.">

Prior works studied this problem in high-dimensional Markovian environments, when the current observation may be a complex object but is sufficient to decode the informative state. In this work, we consider the problem of discovering the agent-centric state in the more challenging high-dimensional non-Markovian setting, when the state can be decoded from a sequence of past observations. We establish that generalized inverse models can be adapted for learning agent-centric state representation for this task. Our results include asymptotic theory in the deterministic dynamics setting as well as counter-examples for alternative intuitive algorithms. We complement these findings with a thorough empirical study on the agent-centric state discovery abilities of the different alternatives we put forward. Particularly notable is our analysis of past actions, where we show that these can be a double-edged sword: making the algorithms more successful when used correctly and causing dramatic failure when used incorrectly.">

        <tr id="Mesh denoising, aimed at removing noise from input meshes while preserving their feature structures, is a practical yet challenging task. Despite the remarkable progress in learning-based mesh denoising methodologies in recent years, their network designs often encounter two principal drawbacks: a dependence on single-modal geometric representations, which fall short in capturing the multifaceted attributes of meshes, and a lack of effective global feature aggregation, hindering their ability to fully understand the mesh's comprehensive structure. To tackle these issues, we propose SurfaceFormer, a pioneering Transformer-based mesh denoising framework. Our first contribution is the development of a new representation known as Local Surface Descriptor, which is crafted by establishing polar systems on each mesh face, followed by sampling points from adjacent surfaces using geodesics. The normals of these points are organized into 2D patches, mimicking images to capture local geometric intricacies, whereas the poles and vertex coordinates are consolidated into a point cloud to embody spatial information. This advancement surmounts the hurdles posed by the irregular and non-Euclidean characteristics of mesh data, facilitating a smooth integration with Transformer architecture. Next, we propose a dual-stream structure consisting of a Geometric Encoder branch and a Spatial Encoder branch, which jointly encode local geometry details and spatial information to fully explore multimodal information for mesh denoising. A subsequent Denoising Transformer module receives the multimodal information and achieves efficient global feature aggregation through self-attention operators. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that this novel approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both objective and subjective assessments, marking a significant leap forward in mesh denoising.">

Cartography methods based on models integrate designed priors, such as sparsity and low-rank structures, to refine the solution of this inverse problem. In our previous work, EMF exposure map reconstruction was achieved by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) where physical laws or structural constraints were employed as a prior, but they require a large amount of labeled data or simulated full maps for training to produce efficient results. In this paper, we present a method to reconstruct EMF exposure maps using only the generator network in GANs which does not require explicit training, thus overcoming the limitations of GANs, such as using reference full exposure maps. This approach uses a prior from sensor data as Local Image Prior (LIP) captured by deep convolutional generative networks independent of learning the network parameters from images in an urban environment. Experimental results show that, even when only sparse sensor data are available, our method can produce accurate estimates.">

In contrast to the more popular Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) method, DeepLWC maximizes the advantages of traditional mathematical methods in solving PDEs and employs a new sampling approach, leading to improved accuracy and faster computations. It is particularly worth pointing that, DeepLWC introduces a novel research paradigm for numerical equation-solving, which can be combined with various traditional numerical methods, enabling acceleration and reduction in storage requirements of conventional approaches.">

 Numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) are instrumental for material structural design where extensive data screening is needed. However, traditional numerical methods demand significant computational resources, highlighting the need for innovative optimization algorithms to streamline design exploration. Direct gradient-based optimization algorithms, while effective, rely on design initialization and require complex, problem-specific sensitivity derivations. The advent of machine learning offers a promising alternative to handling large parameter spaces. To further mitigate data dependency, researchers have developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to learn directly from PDEs. However, the intrinsic continuity requirement of PINNs restricts their application in structural mechanics problems, especially for composite materials. Our work addresses this discontinuity issue by substituting the PDE residual with a weak formulation in the physics-informed training process. The proposed approach is exemplified in modeling digital materials, which are mathematical representations of complex composites that possess extreme structural discontinuity. This paper also introduces an interactive process that integrates physics-informed loss with design objectives, eliminating the need for pre-trained surrogate models or analytical sensitivity derivations. The results demonstrate that our approach can preserve the physical accuracy in data-free material surrogate modeling but also accelerates the direct optimization process without model pre-training.">

        <tr id="Practical acoustic propagation modeling is significantly affected by ocean dynamics, and then can be exploited in numerous oceanic applications, where "practical" refers to modeling acoustic propagation in simulations that mimic real-world ocean environments. Physics-based numerical models provide approximate solutions of wave equation and rely on accurate prior environmental knowledge while the environment of practical scenarios is largely unknown. In contrast, data-driven machine learning offers a promising avenue to estimate practical acoustic propagation by learning from dataset. However, collecting such a high-quality, noise-free, and dense dataset remains challenging. Under the practical hurdle posed by the above approaches, the emergence of physics-informed neural network (PINN) presents an alternative to integrate physics and data but with limited representation capacity. In this work, a framework, termed spatial domain decomposition-based physics-informed neural networks (SPINNs), is proposed to enhance the representation capacity in spatially dependent oceanic scenarios and effectively learn from incomplete and biased prior physics and noisy dataset. Experiments demonstrate SPINNs' advantages over PINN in practical acoustic propagation estimation. The learning capacity of SPINNs toward physics and dataset during training is further analyzed. This work holds promise for practical applications and future expansion.">

 Learned Primal-Dual (LPD) is a deep learning based method for composite optimization problems that is based on unrolling/unfolding the primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm. While achieving great successes in applications, the mathematical interpretation of LPD as a truncated iterative scheme is not necessarily sufficient to fully understand its properties. In this paper, we study the LPD with a general linear operator. We model the forward propagation of LPD as a system of difference equations and a system of differential equations in discrete- and continuous-time settings (for primal and dual variables/trajectories), which are named discrete-time LPD and continuous-time LPD, respectively. Forward analyses such as stabilities and the convergence of the state variables of the discrete-time LPD to the solution of continuous-time LPD are given. Moreover, we analyze the learning problems with/without regularization terms of both discrete-time and continuous-time LPD from the optimal control viewpoint. We prove convergence results of their optimal solutions with respect to the network state initialization and training data, showing in some sense the topological stability of the learning problems. We also establish convergence from the solution of the discrete-time LPD learning problem to that of the continuous-time LPD learning problem through a piecewise linear extension, under some appropriate assumptions on the space of learnable parameters. This study demonstrates theoretically the robustness of the LPD structure and the associated training process, and can induce some future research and applications.">

        <tr id="Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.">
