        <tr id="Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic) graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed, recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in multi-variate time-series forecasting (MTSF) tasks because of their capability in capturing the correlations among different time-series. These graph-based learning approaches improve the forecasting performance by discovering and understanding the underlying graph structures, which represent the data correlation. When the explicit prior graph structures are not available, most existing works cannot guarantee the sparsity of the generated graphs that make the overall model computational expensive and less interpretable. In this work, we propose a decoupled training method, which includes a graph generating module and a GNNs forecasting module. First, we use Graphical Lasso (or GraphLASSO) to directly exploit the sparsity pattern from data to build graph structures in both static and time-varying cases. Second, we fit these graph structures and the input data into a Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN) to train a forecasting model. The experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our novel approach has competitive performance against existing state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms while providing sparse, meaningful and explainable graph structures and reducing training time by approximately 40%. Our PyTorch implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/GraphLASSO">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting lies at the core of important real-world applications in many fields of science and engineering. The abundance of large time series datasets that consist of complex patterns and long-term dependencies has led to the development of various neural network architectures. Graph neural network approaches, which jointly learn a graph structure based on the correlation of raw values of multivariate time series while forecasting, have recently seen great success. However, such solutions are often costly to train and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose TimeGNN, a method that learns dynamic temporal graph representations that can capture the evolution of inter-series patterns along with the correlations of multiple series. TimeGNN achieves inference times 4 to 80 times faster than other state-of-the-art graph-based methods while achieving comparable forecasting performance">

        <tr id="Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series is an extensively studied subject in finance, transportation, and computer science. Fully mining the correlation and causation between the variables in a multivariate time series exhibits noticeable results in improving the performance of a time series model. Recently, some models have explored the dependencies between variables through end-to-end graph structure learning without the need for predefined graphs. However, current models do not incorporate the trade-off between efficiency and flexibility and lack the guidance of domain knowledge in the design of graph structure learning algorithms. This paper alleviates the above issues by proposing Balanced Graph Structure Learning for Forecasting (BGSLF), a novel deep learning model that joins graph structure learning and forecasting. Technically, BGSLF leverages the spatial information into convolutional operations and extracts temporal dynamics using the diffusion convolutional recurrent network. The proposed framework balance the trade-off between efficiency and flexibility by introducing Multi-Graph Generation Network (MGN) and Graph Selection Module. In addition, a method named Smooth Sparse Unit (SSU) is designed to sparse the learned graph structures, which conforms to the sparse spatial correlations in the real world. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances with minor trainable parameters. Code will be made publicly available.">

The core assumption behind these models is that there is a latent graph between the time series (nodes) that governs the evolution of the multivariate time series. By parameterizing a graph in a differentiable way, the models aim to improve forecasting quality. We compare four recent models of this class on the forecasting task. Further, we perform ablations to study their behavior under changing conditions, e.g., when disabling the graph-learning modules and providing the ground-truth relations instead.

        <tr id="Multivariate time-series forecasting is a critical task for many applications, and graph time-series network is widely studied due to its capability to capture the spatial-temporal correlation simultaneously. However, most existing works focus more on learning with the explicit prior graph structure, while ignoring potential information from the implicit graph structure, yielding incomplete structure modeling. Some recent works attempts to learn the intrinsic or implicit graph structure directly, while lacking a way to combine explicit prior structure with implicit structure together. In this paper, we propose Regularized Graph Structure Learning (RGSL) model to incorporate both explicit prior structure and implicit structure together, and learn the forecasting deep networks along with the graph structure. RGSL consists of two innovative modules. First, we derive an implicit dense similarity matrix through node embedding, and learn the sparse graph structure using the Regularized Graph Generation (RGG) based on the Gumbel Softmax trick. Second, we propose a Laplacian Matrix Mixed-up Module (LM3) to fuse the explicit graph and implicit graph together. We conduct experiments on three real-word datasets. Results show that the proposed RGSL model outperforms existing graph forecasting algorithms with a notable margin, while learning meaningful graph structure simultaneously.

Exploration of the correlation and causation among the variables in a multivariate time series shows promise in enhancing the performance of a time series model. When using deep neural networks as forecasting models, we hypothesize that exploiting the pairwise information among multiple (multivariate) time series also improves their forecast. If an explicit graph structure is known, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools to exploit the structure. In this work, we propose learning the structure simultaneously with the GNN if the graph is unknown. We cast the problem as learning a probabilistic graph model through optimizing the mean performance over the graph distribution. The distribution is parameterized by a neural network so that discrete graphs can be sampled differentiably through reparameterization. Empirical evaluations show that our method is simpler, more efficient, and better performing than a recently proposed bilevel learning approach for graph structure learning, as well as a broad array of forecasting models, either deep or non-deep learning based, and graph or non-graph based.">

        <tr id="Multi-variate time series forecasting is an important problem with a wide range of applications. Recent works model the relations between time-series as graphs and have shown that propagating information over the relation graph can improve time series forecasting. However, in many cases, relational information is not available or is noisy and reliable. Moreover, most works ignore the underlying uncertainty of time-series both for structure learning and deriving the forecasts resulting in the structure not capturing the uncertainty resulting in forecast distributions with poor uncertainty estimates. We tackle this challenge and introduce STOIC, that leverages stochastic correlations between time-series to learn underlying structure between time-series and to provide well-calibrated and accurate forecasts. Over a wide-range of benchmark datasets STOIC provides around 16% more accurate and 14% better-calibrated forecasts. STOIC also shows better adaptation to noise in data during inference and captures important and useful relational information in various benchmarks.">
