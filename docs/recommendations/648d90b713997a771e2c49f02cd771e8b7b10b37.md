        <tr id="Medical time series are sequential data collected over time that measures health-related signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and intensive care unit (ICU) readings. Analyzing medical time series and identifying the latent patterns and trends that lead to uncovering highly valuable insights for enhancing diagnosis, treatment, risk assessment, and disease progression. However, data mining in medical time series is heavily limited by the sample annotation which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and expert-depending. To mitigate this challenge, the emerging self-supervised contrastive learning, which has shown great success since 2020, is a promising solution. Contrastive learning aims to learn representative embeddings by contrasting positive and negative samples without the requirement for explicit labels. Here, we conducted a systematic review of how contrastive learning alleviates the label scarcity in medical time series based on PRISMA standards. We searched the studies in five scientific databases (IEEE, ACM, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed) and retrieved 1908 papers based on the inclusion criteria. After applying excluding criteria, and screening at title, abstract, and full text levels, we carefully reviewed 43 papers in this area. Specifically, this paper outlines the pipeline of contrastive learning, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and testing. We provide a comprehensive summary of the various augmentations applied to medical time series data, the architectures of pre-training encoders, the types of fine-tuning classifiers and clusters, and the popular contrastive loss functions. Moreover, we present an overview of the different data types used in medical time series, highlight the medical applications of interest, and provide a comprehensive table of 51 public datasets that have been utilized in this field. In addition, this paper will provide a discussion on the promising future scopes such as providing guidance for effective augmentation design, developing a unified framework for analyzing hierarchical time series, and investigating methods for processing multimodal data. Despite being in its early stages, self-supervised contrastive learning has shown great potential in overcoming the need for expert-created annotations in the research of medical time series.">

        <tr id="Time series is a typical data type in numerous domains; however, labeling large amounts of time series data can be costly and time-consuming. Learning effective representation from unlabeled time series data is a challenging task. Contrastive learning stands out as a promising method to acquire representations of unlabeled time series data. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised time-series representation learning framework via Time-Frequency Fusion Contrasting (TF-FC) to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. Specifically, TF-FC combines time-domain augmentation with frequency-domain augmentation to generate the diverse samples. For time-domain augmentation, the raw time series data pass through the time-domain augmentation bank (such as jitter, scaling, permutation, and masking) and get time-domain augmentation data. For frequency-domain augmentation, first, the raw time series undergoes conversion into frequency domain data following Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. Then, the frequency data passes through the frequency-domain augmentation bank (such as low pass filter, remove frequency, add frequency, and phase shift) and gets frequency-domain augmentation data. The fusion method of time-domain augmentation data and frequency-domain augmentation data is kernel PCA, which is useful for extracting nonlinear features in high-dimensional spaces. By capturing both the time and frequency domains of the time series, the proposed approach is able to extract more informative features from the data, enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish between different time series. To verify the effectiveness of the TF-FC method, we conducted experiments on four time series domain datasets (i.e., SleepEEG, HAR, Gesture, and Epilepsy). Experimental results show that TF-FC significantly improves in recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.">

        <tr id="Limited availability of labeled physiological data often prohibits the use of powerful supervised deep learning models in the biomedical machine intelligence domain. We approach this problem and propose a novel encoding framework that relies on self-supervised learning with momentum contrast to learn representations from multivariate time-series of various physiological domains without needing labels. Our model uses a transformer architecture that can be easily adapted to classification problems by optimizing a linear output classification layer. We experimentally evaluate our framework using two publicly available physiological datasets from different domains, i.e., human activity recognition from embedded inertial sensory and emotion recognition from electroencephalography. We show that our self-supervised learning approach can indeed learn discriminative features which can be exploited in downstream classification tasks. Our work enables the development of domain-agnostic intelligent systems that can effectively analyze multivariate time-series data from physiological domains.">

        <tr id="In this study, we propose a novel framework for time-series representation learning that integrates a learnable masking-augmentation strategy into a contrastive learning framework. Time-series data pose challenges due to their temporal dependencies and feature-extraction complexities. To address these challenges, we introduce a masking-based reconstruction approach within a contrastive learning context, aiming to enhance the model’s ability to learn discriminative temporal features. Our method leverages self-supervised learning to effectively capture both global and local patterns by strategically masking segments of the time-series data and reconstructing them, which aids in revealing nuanced temporal dependencies. We utilize learnable masking as a dynamic augmentation technique, which enables the model to optimize contextual relationships in the data and extract meaningful representations that are both context-aware and robust. Extensive experiments were conducted on multiple time-series datasets, including SleepEDF-78, 20, UCI-HAR, achieving improvements of 2%, 2.55%, and 3.89% each and similar performance on Epilepsy in accuracy over baseline methods. Our results show significant performance gains compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of our framework to advance the field of time-series analysis by improving the quality of learned representations and enhancing downstream task performance.">

        <tr id="Learning semantic-rich representations from unlabeled time series data with intricate dynamics is a notable challenge. Traditional contrastive learning techniques predominantly focus on segment-level augmentations through time slicing, a practice that, while valuable, often results in sampling bias and suboptimal performance due to the loss of global context. Furthermore, they typically disregard the vital frequency information to enrich data representations. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised general-purpose framework called Temporal-Frequency and Contextual Consistency (TFCC). Specifically, this framework first performs two instance-level augmentation families over the entire series to capture nuanced representations alongside critical long-term dependencies. Then, TFCC advances by initiating dual cross-view forecasting tasks between the original series and its augmented counterpart in both time and frequency domains to learn robust representations. Finally, three specially designed consistency modules 'temporal, frequency, and temporal-frequency' aid in further developing discriminative representations on top of the learned robust representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate TFCC's superiority over the state-of-the-art classification and forecasting methods and exhibit exceptional efficiency in semi-supervised and transfer learning scenarios.">

Current approaches often focus on isolated feature representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse healthcare settings.">

However, for time series with less intuitive or semantic meaning, sampling bias may be inevitably encountered in unsupervised approaches. Although supervised contrastive learning has shown superior performance by leveraging label information, it may also suffer from class collapse. In this study, we consider a realistic scenario in industry with limited annotation information available. A supervised contrastive framework is developed for high-frequency time series representation and classification, wherein a novel variant of supervised contrastive loss is proposed to include multiple augmentations while induce spread within each class. Experiments on four mainstream public datasets as well as a series of sensitivity and ablation analyses demonstrate that the learned representations are effective and robust compared with the direct supervised learning and self-supervised learning, notably under the minimal few-shot situation.">

        <tr id="Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components. Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios across diverse datasets.">

        <tr id="Contrastive representation learning is crucial in medical time series analysis as it alleviates dependency on labor-intensive, domain-specific, and scarce expert annotations. However, existing contrastive learning methods primarily focus on one single data level, which fails to fully exploit the intricate nature of medical time series. To address this issue, we present COMET, an innovative hierarchical framework that leverages data consistencies at all inherent levels in medical time series. Our meticulously designed model systematically captures data consistency from four potential levels: observation, sample, trial, and patient levels. By developing contrastive loss at multiple levels, we can learn effective representations that preserve comprehensive data consistency, maximizing information utilization in a self-supervised manner. We conduct experiments in the challenging patient-independent setting. We compare COMET against six baselines using three diverse datasets, which include ECG signals for myocardial infarction and EEG signals for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The results demonstrate that COMET consistently outperforms all baselines, particularly in setup with 10% and 1% labeled data fractions across all datasets. These results underscore the significant impact of our framework in advancing contrastive representation learning techniques for medical time series.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) provides a strategy for improving machine learning performance in data-rich (target) domains where ground truth labels are inaccessible but can be found in related (source) domains. In cases where meta-domain information such as label distributions is available, weak supervision can further boost performance. We propose a novel framework, CALDA, to tackle these two problems. CALDA synergistically combines the principles of contrastive learning and adversarial learning to robustly support multi-source UDA (MS-UDA) for time series data. Similar to prior methods, CALDA utilizes adversarial learning to align source and target feature representations. Unlike prior approaches, CALDA additionally leverages cross-source label information across domains. CALDA pulls examples with the same label close to each other, while pushing apart examples with different labels, reshaping the space through contrastive learning. Unlike prior contrastive adaptation methods, CALDA requires neither data augmentation nor pseudo labeling, which may be more challenging for time series. We empirically validate our proposed approach. Based on results from human activity recognition, electromyography, and synthetic datasets, we find utilizing cross-source information improves performance over prior time series and contrastive methods. Weak supervision further improves performance, even in the presence of noise, allowing CALDA to offer generalizable strategies for MS-UDA.">
