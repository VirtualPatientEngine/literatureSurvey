        <tr id="Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.">

        <tr id="In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different time points. Here, we introduce RAINDROP, a graph neural network that embeds irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. RAINDROP represents every sample as a separate sensor graph and models time-varying dependencies between sensors with a novel message passing operator. It estimates the latent sensor graph structure and leverages the structure together with nearby observations to predict misaligned readouts. This model can be interpreted as a graph neural network that sends messages over graphs that are optimized for capturing time-varying dependencies among sensors. We use RAINDROP to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. RAINDROP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.4% (absolute F1-score points), including techniques that deal with irregular sampling using fixed discretization and set functions. RAINDROP shows superiority in diverse setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have shown to be effective in time series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global) inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate predictions.">

        <tr id="Outstanding achievements of graph neural networks for spatiotemporal time series analysis show that relational constraints introduce an effective inductive bias into neural forecasting architectures. Often, however, the relational information characterizing the underlying data-generating process is unavailable and the practitioner is left with the problem of inferring from data which relational graph to use in the subsequent processing stages. We propose novel, principled - yet practical - probabilistic score-based methods that learn the relational dependencies as distributions over graphs while maximizing end-to-end the performance at task. The proposed graph learning framework is based on consolidated variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo score-based gradient estimation, is theoretically grounded, and, as we show, effective in practice. In this paper, we focus on the time series forecasting problem and show that, by tailoring the gradient estimators to the graph learning problem, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance while controlling the sparsity of the learned graph and the computational scalability. We empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that the proposed solution can be used as a stand-alone graph identification procedure as well as a graph learning component of an end-to-end forecasting architecture.">

        <tr id="Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic) graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed, recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions.">

        <tr id="By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.">

        <tr id="Attention mechanisms have been widely used to capture long-range dependencies among nodes in Graph Transformers. Bottlenecked by the quadratic computational cost, attention mechanisms fail to scale in large graphs. Recent improvements in computational efficiency are mainly achieved by attention sparsification with random or heuristic-based graph subsampling, which falls short in data-dependent context reasoning. State space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained prominence for their effectiveness and efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, adapting SSMs to non-sequential graph data presents a notable challenge. In this work, we introduce Graph-Mamba, the first attempt to enhance long-range context modeling in graph networks by integrating a Mamba block with the input-dependent node selection mechanism. Specifically, we formulate graph-centric node prioritization and permutation strategies to enhance context-aware reasoning, leading to a substantial improvement in predictive performance. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-range graph prediction tasks, with a fraction of the computational cost in both FLOPs and GPU memory consumption. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/Graph-Mamba.">

        <tr id="Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.">

        <tr id="Large pre-trained models excel in zero/few-shot learning for language and vision tasks but face challenges in multivariate time series (TS) forecasting due to diverse data characteristics. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1. Model weights for more sophisticated variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, and TTM-A) will be shared soon.

        <tr id="Pre-training on time series poses a unique challenge due to the potential mismatch between pre-training and target domains, such as shifts in temporal dynamics, fast-evolving trends, and long-range and short-cyclic effects, which can lead to poor downstream performance. While domain adaptation methods can mitigate these shifts, most methods need examples directly from the target domain, making them suboptimal for pre-training. To address this challenge, methods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and be capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training. Relative to other modalities, in time series, we expect that time-based and frequency-based representations of the same example are located close together in the time-frequency space. To this end, we posit that time-frequency consistency (TF-C) -- embedding a time-based neighborhood of an example close to its frequency-based neighborhood -- is desirable for pre-training. Motivated by TF-C, we define a decomposable pre-training model, where the self-supervised signal is provided by the distance between time and frequency components, each individually trained by contrastive estimation. We evaluate the new method on eight datasets, including electrodiagnostic testing, human activity recognition, mechanical fault detection, and physical status monitoring. Experiments against eight state-of-the-art methods show that TF-C outperforms baselines by 15.4% (F1 score) on average in one-to-one settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model on EMG data) and by 8.4% (precision) in challenging one-to-many settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model for either hand-gesture recognition or mechanical fault prediction), reflecting the breadth of scenarios that arise in real-world applications.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that Raincoat can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.">

The proposed AZ-test can be intended as a spatio-temporal extension of traditional tests designed for system identiﬁcation to graph signals. The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes over time, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as it is the case in many application scenarios like sensor and transportation networks. The asymptotic distribution of the designed test can be derived under the null hypothesis without assuming identically distributed data. We show the effectiveness of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and illustrate how it can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graph stream.">

Within this framework, relational inductive biases, e.g., associated with functional dependencies existing among signals, are not explicitly exploited leaving unattended great opportunities for effective modeling approaches. The manuscript aims, for the first time, at filling this gap by matching state-space modeling and spatio-temporal data where the relational information, say the functional graph capturing latent dependencies, is learned directly from data and is allowed to change over time. Within a probabilistic formulation that accounts for the uncertainty in the data-generating process, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn the state-space model end-to-end on a downstream task.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a pivotal role in many real-world applications. Recently, the utilization of Large Language Models (LLM) in TSF has demonstrated exceptional predictive performance, surpassing most task-specific forecasting models. The success of LLM-based forecasting methods underscores the importance of causal dependence modeling and pre-trained knowledge transfer. However, challenges persist in directly applying LLM to TSF, i.e., the unacceptable parameter scales for resource-intensive model optimization, and the significant gap of feature space between structural numerical time series and natural language. To this end, we propose LeRet, a Language-empowered Retentive network for TSF. Technically, inspired by the causal extraction in LLM, we propose a causal dependence learner, enhanced by a patch-level pre-training task, to capture sequential causal evolution. To minimize the gap between numeric and language, we initialize a language description protocol for time series and design a TS-related language knowledge extractor to learn from language description, avoiding training with large-scale parameters. Finally, we dedicatedly achieve a Language-TS Modality Integrator for the fusion of two types data, and enable language-empowered sequence forecasting. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our LeRet, especially reveal superiority on few-shot, and zero-shot forecasting tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/hqh0728/LeRet.">

        <tr id="The self-attention mechanism in Transformer architecture, invariant to sequence order, necessitates positional embeddings to encode temporal order in time series prediction. We argue that this reliance on positional embeddings restricts the Transformer's ability to effectively represent temporal sequences, particularly when employing longer lookback windows. To address this, we introduce an innovative approach that combines Pyramid RNN embeddings(PRE) for univariate time series with the Transformer's capability to model multivariate dependencies. PRE, utilizing pyramidal one-dimensional convolutional layers, constructs multiscale convolutional features that preserve temporal order. Additionally, RNNs, layered atop these features, learn multiscale time series representations sensitive to sequence order. This integration into Transformer models with attention mechanisms results in significant performance enhancements. We present the PRformer, a model integrating PRE with a standard Transformer encoder, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets. This performance highlights the effectiveness of our approach in leveraging longer lookback windows and underscores the critical role of robust temporal representations in maximizing Transformer's potential for prediction tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose FedTime, a federated large language model (LLM) tailored for long-range time series prediction.

Prior to the learning process, we employ K-means clustering to partition edge devices or clients into distinct clusters, thereby facilitating more focused model training. We also incorporate channel independence and patching to better preserve local semantic information, ensuring that important contextual details are retained while minimizing the risk of information loss. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our FedTime model through extensive experiments on various real-world forecasting benchmarks, showcasing substantial improvements over recent approaches. In addition, we demonstrate the efficiency of FedTime in streamlining resource usage, resulting in reduced communication overhead.">

Different from other modalities, time series present unique challenges due to their complex and dynamic nature, including the entanglement of nonlinear patterns and time-variant trends. Analyzing time series data is of great significance in real-world scenarios and has been widely studied over centuries. Recent years have witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in the time series community, with techniques shifting from traditional statistical methods to advanced deep learning models. In this paper, we delve into the design of deep time series models across various analysis tasks and review the existing literature from two perspectives: basic modules and model architectures. Further, we develop and release Time Series Library (TSLib) as a fair benchmark of deep time series models for diverse analysis tasks, which implements 24 mainstream models, covers 30 datasets from different domains, and supports five prevalent analysis tasks. Based on TSLib, we thoroughly evaluate 12 advanced deep time series models on different tasks. Empirical results indicate that models with specific structures are well-suited for distinct analytical tasks, which offers insights for research and adoption of deep time series models.

        <tr id="Recently many deep learning models have been proposed for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Based on previous literature, we identify three critical patterns that can improve forecasting accuracy: the order and semantic dependencies in time dimension as well as cross-variate dependency. However, little effort has been made to simultaneously consider order and semantic dependencies when developing forecasting models. Moreover, existing approaches utilize cross-variate dependency by mixing information from different timestamps and variates, which may introduce irrelevant or harmful cross-variate information to the time dimension and largely hinder forecasting performance. To overcome these limitations, we investigate the potential of Mamba for LTSF and discover two key advantages benefiting forecasting: (i) the selection mechanism makes Mamba focus on or ignore specific inputs and learn semantic dependency easily, and (ii) Mamba preserves order dependency by processing sequences recursively. After that, we empirically find that the non-linear activation used in Mamba is unnecessary for semantically sparse time series data. Therefore, we further propose SAMBA, a Simplified Mamba with disentangled dependency encoding. Specifically, we first remove the non-linearities of Mamba to make it more suitable for LTSF. Furthermore, we propose a disentangled dependency encoding strategy to endow Mamba with cross-variate dependency modeling capabilities while reducing the interference between time and variate dimensions. Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SAMBA over state-of-the-art forecasting models.">

        <tr id="Long time series forecasting aims to utilize historical information to forecast future states over extended horizons. Traditional RNN-based series forecasting methods struggle to effectively address long-term dependencies and gradient issues in long time series problems. Recently, SegRNN has emerged as a leading RNN-based model tailored for long-term series forecasting, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a streamlined architecture through innovative segmentation and parallel decoding techniques. Nevertheless, SegRNN has several limitations: its fixed segmentation disrupts data continuity and fails to effectively leverage information across different segments, the segmentation strategy employed by SegRNN does not fundamentally address the issue of information loss within the recurrent structure. To address these issues, we propose the ISMRNN method with three key enhancements: we introduce an implicit segmentation structure to decompose the time series and map it to segmented hidden states, resulting in denser information exchange during the segmentation phase. Additionally, we incorporate residual structures in the encoding layer to mitigate information loss within the recurrent structure. To extract information more effectively, we further integrate the Mamba architecture to enhance time series information extraction. Experiments on several real-world long time series forecasting datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art models.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have raised questions about the suitability of the Transformer architecture for long sequence time-series forecasting. These forecasting models leverage Transformers to capture dependencies between multiple time steps in a time series, with embedding tokens composed of data from individual time steps. However, challenges arise when applying Transformers to predict long sequences with strong periodicity, leading to performance degradation and increased computational burden. Furthermore, embedding tokens formed one time step at a time may struggle to reveal meaningful information in long sequences, failing to capture correlations between different time steps. In this study, we propose Skip-Timeformer, a Transformer-based model that utilizes a skip-time interaction for long sequence time-series forecasting. Specifically, we decompose the time series into multiple subsequences based on different time intervals, embedding various time steps into variable tokens across multiple sequences. The skip-time interaction mechanism utilizes these variable tokens to capture dependencies in the skip-time dimension. Additionally, skip-time interaction is employed to learn dependencies between sequences missed by multiple skip time steps. The Skip-Timeformer model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets, further enhancing the long sequence forecasting capabilities of the Transformer variations and better adapting to arbitrary lookback windows.">

To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach using an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for time series analysis. The framework leverages a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture where the master agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents and delegates the end-user request to the relevant sub-agent. The sub-agents utilize smaller, pre-trained language models (SLMs) customized for specific time series tasks through fine-tuning using instruction tuning and direct preference optimization, and retrieve relevant prompts from a shared repository of prompt pools containing distilled knowledge about historical patterns and trends to improve predictions on new data. Our proposed modular, multi-agent RAG approach offers flexibility and achieves state-of-the-art performance across major time series tasks by tackling complex challenges more effectively than task-specific customized methods across benchmark datasets.">

In this paper, we propose a model for better forecasting time series: Decoupled Invariant Attention Network (DIAN), which contains two modules to learn spatial and temporal relationships respectively: 1) Spatial Decoupled Invariant-Variant Learning (SDIVL) to decouple the spatial invariant and variant attention scores, and then leverage convolutional networks to effectively integrate them for subsequent layers; 2) Temporal Augmented Invariant-Variant Learning (TAIVL) to decouple temporal invariant and variant patterns and combine them for further forecasting.In this module, we also design Temporal Intervention Mechanism to create multiple intervened samples by reassembling variant patterns across time stamps to eliminate the spurious impacts of variant patterns.In addition, we propose Joint Optimization to minimize the loss function considering all invariant patterns, variant patterns and intervened patterns so that our model can gain a more stable predictive ability.Extensive experiments on five datasets have demonstrated our superior performance with higher efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.">

        <tr id="Deep models for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting have recently demonstrated significant success. Channel-dependent models capture complex dependencies that channel-independent models cannot capture. However, the number of channels in real-world applications outpaces the capabilities of existing channel-dependent models, and contrary to common expectations, some models underperform the channel-independent models in handling high-dimensional data, which raises questions about the performance of channel-dependent models. To address this, our study first investigates the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of these channel-dependent models on high-dimensional MTS data. Our analysis reveals that two primary issues lie in the introduced noise from unrelated series that increases the difficulty of capturing the crucial inter-channel dependencies, and challenges in training strategies due to high-dimensional data. To address these issues, we propose STHD, the Scalable Transformer for High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting. STHD has three components: a) Relation Matrix Sparsity that limits the noise introduced and alleviates the memory issue; b) ReIndex applied as a training strategy to enable a more flexible batch size setting and increase the diversity of training data; and c) Transformer that handles 2-D inputs and captures channel dependencies. These components jointly enable STHD to manage the high-dimensional MTS while maintaining computational feasibility. Furthermore, experimental results show STHD's considerable improvement on three high-dimensional datasets: Crime-Chicago, Wiki-People, and Traffic.

This multifaceted challenge has recently gained attention within the deep learning domain, facilitated by the availability of extensive, long-term earthquake datasets. Despite significant advancements, existing literature on earthquake nowcasting lacks comprehensive evaluations of pre-trained foundation models and modern deep learning architectures. These architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, uniquely focus on different aspects of data, including spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and multi-scale dependencies. This paper addresses the mentioned gap by analyzing different architectures and introducing two innovation approaches called MultiFoundationQuake and GNNCoder. We formulate earthquake nowcasting as a time series forecasting problem for the next 14 days within 0.1-degree spatial bins in Southern California, spanning from 1986 to 2024. Earthquake time series is forecasted as a function of logarithm energy released by quakes. Our comprehensive evaluation employs several key performance metrics, notably Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and Mean Squared Error, over time in each spatial region. The results demonstrate that our introduced models outperform other custom architectures by effectively capturing temporal-spatial relationships inherent in seismic data. The performance of existing foundation models varies significantly based on the pre-training datasets, emphasizing the need for careful dataset selection. However, we introduce a new general approach termed MultiFoundationPattern that combines a bespoke pattern with foundation model results handled as auxiliary streams. In the earthquake case, the resultant MultiFoundationQuake model achieves the best overall performance.">

Moreover, time series data exhibit diverse variations and fluctuations across different temporal scales, which traditional approaches struggle to model effectively. In this paper, we propose a dynamic tokenizer with a dynamic sparse learning algorithm to capture diverse receptive fields and sparse patterns of time series data. In order to build hierarchical receptive fields, we develop a multi-scale Transformer model, coupled with multi-scale sequence extraction, capable of capturing multi-resolution features. Additionally, we introduce a group-aware rotary position encoding technique to enhance intra- and inter-group position awareness among representations across different temporal scales. Our proposed model, named DRFormer, is evaluated on various real-world datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its superiority compared to existing methods.

        <tr id="Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.">

        <tr id="It is challenging to scale time series forecasting models such that they forecast accurately for multiple distinct domains and datasets, all with potentially different underlying collection procedures (e.g., sample resolution), patterns (e.g., periodicity), and prediction requirements (e.g., reconstruction vs. forecasting). We call this general task universal forecasting. Existing methods usually assume that input data is regularly sampled, and they forecast to pre-determined horizons, resulting in failure to generalise outside of the scope of their training. We propose the DAM - a neural model that takes randomly sampled histories and outputs an adjustable basis composition as a continuous function of time for forecasting to non-fixed horizons. It involves three key components: (1) a flexible approach for using randomly sampled histories from a long-tail distribution, that enables an efficient global perspective of the underlying temporal dynamics while retaining focus on the recent history; (2) a transformer backbone that is trained on these actively sampled histories to produce, as representational output, (3) the basis coefficients of a continuous function of time. We show that a single univariate DAM, trained on 25 time series datasets, either outperformed or closely matched existing SoTA models at multivariate long-term forecasting across 18 datasets, including 8 held-out for zero-shot transfer, even though these models were trained to specialise for each dataset-horizon combination. This single DAM excels at zero-shot transfer and very-long-term forecasting, performs well at imputation, is interpretable via basis function composition and attention, can be tuned for different inference-cost requirements, is robust to missing and irregularly sampled data {by design}.">

Existing methods mainly focus on long-term dependency modeling, neglecting the complexities of short-term dynamics, which may hinder performance. Transformers are superior in modeling long-term dependencies but are criticized for their quadratic computational cost. Mamba provides a near-linear alternative but is reported less effective in time series longterm forecasting due to potential information loss. Current architectures fall short in offering both high efficiency and strong performance for long-term dependency modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Universals (MoU), a versatile model to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies for enhancing performance in time series forecasting. MoU is composed of two novel designs: Mixture of Feature Extractors (MoF), an adaptive method designed to improve time series patch representations for short-term dependency, and Mixture of Architectures (MoA), which hierarchically integrates Mamba, FeedForward, Convolution, and Self-Attention architectures in a specialized order to model long-term dependency from a hybrid perspective. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining relatively low computational costs.

        <tr id="In multivariate time-series forecasting (MTSF), extracting the temporal correlations of the input sequences is crucial. While popular Transformer-based predictive models can perform well, their quadratic computational complexity results in inefficiency and high overhead. The recently emerged Mamba, a selective state space model, has shown promising results in many fields due to its strong temporal feature extraction capabilities and linear computational complexity. However, due to the unilateral nature of Mamba, channel-independent predictive models based on Mamba cannot attend to the relationships among all variables in the manner of Transformer-based models. To address this issue, we combine fast-attention with Mamba to introduce a novel framework named FMamba for MTSF. Technically, we first extract the temporal features of the input variables through an embedding layer, then compute the dependencies among input variables via the fast-attention module. Subsequently, we use Mamba to selectively deal with the input features and further extract the temporal dependencies of the variables through the multi-layer perceptron block (MLP-block). Finally, FMamba obtains the predictive results through the projector, a linear layer. Experimental results on eight public datasets demonstrate that FMamba can achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational overhead.">

        <tr id="Discrete-Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs), which are prevalent in real-world implementations and notable for their ease of data acquisition, have garnered considerable attention from both academic researchers and industry practitioners. The representation learning of DTDGs has been extensively applied to model the dynamics of temporally changing entities and their evolving connections. Currently, DTDG representation learning predominantly relies on GNN+RNN architectures, which manifest the inherent limitations of both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). GNNs suffer from the over-smoothing issue as the models architecture goes deeper, while RNNs struggle to capture long-term dependencies effectively. GNN+RNN architectures also grapple with scaling to large graph sizes and long sequences. Additionally, these methods often compute node representations separately and focus solely on individual node characteristics, thereby overlooking the behavior intersections between the two nodes whose link is being predicted, such as instances where the two nodes appear together in the same context or share common neighbors. This paper introduces a novel representation learning method DTFormer for DTDGs, pivoting from the traditional GNN+RNN framework to a Transformer-based architecture. Our approach exploits the attention mechanism to concurrently process topological information within the graph at each timestamp and temporal dynamics of graphs along the timestamps, circumventing the aforementioned fundamental weakness of both GNNs and RNNs. Moreover, we enhance the model's expressive capability by incorporating the intersection relationships among nodes and integrating a multi-patching module. Extensive experiments conducted on six public dynamic graph benchmark datasets confirm our model's efficacy, achieving the SOTA performance.">

This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging self-supervised multiscale representation learning to capture both long-term and near-term workload patterns. The long-term history is encoded through multiscale representations while the near-term observations are modeled via temporal flow fusion. These representations of different scales are fused using an attention mechanism and characterized with normalizing flows to handle non-Gaussian/non-linear distributions of time series.

Nevertheless, existing time series representation learning (TSRL) methods face challenges in attaining universality. Indeed, existing methods relying solely on one SSL strategy (either contrastive learning (CL) or generative) often fall short in capturing rich semantic information for various downstream tasks. Moreover, time series exhibit diverse distributions and inherent characteristics, particularly with the common occurrence of missing values, posing a notable challenge for existing backbones in effectively handling such diverse time series data. To bridge these gaps, we propose CTRL, a framework for universal TSRL. For the first time, we employ Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) as the backbone for TSRL, which captures the continuous processes and exhibits robustness to missing data. Additionally, a dual-task SSL strategy, integrating both reconstruction and contrasting tasks, is proposed to enrich the semantic information of the learned representations. Furthermore, novel hard negative construction and false negative elimination mechanisms are proposed to improve sampling efficiency and reduce sampling bias in CL. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CTRL in forecasting, classification, and imputation tasks, particularly its outstanding robustness to missing data.">

We assess the performance of LLMTIME across multiple datasets and introduce classical almost periodic functions as time series to gauge its effectiveness. The empirical results indicate that while large language models can perform well in zero-shot forecasting for certain datasets, their predictive accuracy diminishes notably when confronted with diverse time series data and traditional signals.

        <tr id="Short fixed-length inputs are the main bottleneck of deep learning methods in long time-series forecasting tasks. Prolonging input length causes overfitting, rapidly deteriorating accuracy. Our research indicates that the overfitting is a combination reaction of the multi-scale pattern coupling in time series and the fixed focusing scale of current models. First, we find that the patterns exhibited by a time series across various scales are reflective of its multi-periodic nature, where each scale corresponds to specific period length. Second, We find that the token size predominantly dictates model behavior, as it determines the scale at which the model focuses and the context size it can accommodate. Our idea is to decouple the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series and to model each pattern with its corresponding period length as token size. We introduced a novel series-decomposition module(MPSD), and a Multi-Token Pattern Recognition neural network(MTPR), enabling the model to handle \textit{inputs up to $10\times$ longer}. Sufficient context enhances performance(\textit{38% maximum precision improvement}), and the decoupling approach offers \textit{Low complexity($0.22\times$ cost)} and \textit{high interpretability}.">

        <tr id="Transformer has gained widespread adoption in modeling time series due to the exceptional ability of its self-attention mechanism in capturing long-range dependencies. However, when processing time series data with numerous variates, the vanilla self-attention mechanism tends to distribute attention weights evenly and smoothly, causing row-homogenization in attention maps and further hampering time series forecasting. To tackle this issue, we propose an advanced Transformer architecture entitled SDformer, which designs two novel modules, Spectral-Filter-Transform (SFT) and Dynamic-Directional-Attention (DDA), and integrates them into the encoder of Transformer to achieve more intensive attention allocation. Specifically, the SFT module utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform to select the most prominent frequencies, along with a Hamming Window to smooth and denoise the filtered series data; The DDA module applies a specialized kernel function to the query and key vectors projected from the denoised data, concentrating this innovative attention mechanism more effectively on the most informative variates to obtain a sharper attention distribution. These two modules jointly enable attention weights to be more salient among numerous variates, which in turn enhances the attention's ability to capture multivariate correlations, improving the performance in forecasting. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate its superior performance over other state-of-the-art models. Code is available at https://github.com/zhouziyu02/SDformer.">

        <tr id="Current Transformer methods for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting (MTSF) are all based on the conventional attention mechanism. They involve sequence embedding and performing a linear projection of Q, K, and V, and then computing attention within this latent space. We have never delved into the attention mechanism to explore whether such a mapping space is optimal for MTSF. To investigate this issue, this study first proposes Frequency Spectrum attention (FSatten), a novel attention mechanism based on the frequency domain space. It employs the Fourier transform for embedding and introduces Multi-head Spectrum Scaling (MSS) to replace the conventional linear mapping of Q and K. FSatten can accurately capture the periodic dependencies between sequences and outperform the conventional attention without changing mainstream architectures. We further design a more general method dubbed Scaled Orthogonal attention (SOatten). We propose an orthogonal embedding and a Head-Coupling Convolution (HCC) based on the neighboring similarity bias to guide the model in learning comprehensive dependency patterns. Experiments show that FSatten and SOatten surpass the SOTA which uses conventional attention, making it a good alternative as a basic attention mechanism for MTSF.

        <tr id="Accurate traffic flow forecasting is a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems, playing a pivotal role in enhancing transportation intelligence. The integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers in traffic flow forecasting has gained significant adoption for enhancing prediction accuracy. Yet, the complex spatial and temporal dependencies present in traffic data continue to pose substantial challenges: (1) Most GNN-based methods assume that the graph structure reflects the actual dependencies between nodes, overlooking the complex dependencies present in the real-world context. (2) Standard time-series models are unable to effectively model complex temporal dependencies, hindering prediction accuracy. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a novel Transformer-based Spatiotemporal Graph Diffusion Convolution Network (TSGDC) for Traffic Flow Forecasting, which leverages graph diffusion and transformer to capture the complexity and dynamics of spatial and temporal patterns, thereby enhancing prediction performance. The authors designed an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) that learns separately from the feature dimensions collected by traffic sensors and the temporal dimensions of traffic data, aiding in spatiotemporal modeling. Chebyshev Graph Diffusion Convolution (GDC) is used to capture the complex dependencies within the spatial distribution. Sequence decomposition blocks, as internal operations of transformers, are employed to gradually extract long-term stable trends from hidden complex variables. Additionally, by integrating multi-scale dependencies, including recent, daily, and weekly patterns, accurate traffic flow predictions are achieved. Experimental results on various public datasets show that TSGDC outperforms conventional traffic forecasting models, particularly in accuracy and robustness.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks have shown widespread success for learning on graphs, but they still face fundamental drawbacks, such as limited expressive power, over-smoothing, and over-squashing. Meanwhile, the transformer architecture offers a potential solution to these issues. However, existing graph transformers primarily cater to homogeneous graphs and are unable to model the intricate semantics of heterogeneous graphs. Moreover, unlike small molecular graphs where the entire graph can be considered as the receptive field in graph transformers, real-world heterogeneous graphs comprise a significantly larger number of nodes and cannot be entirely treated as such. Consequently, existing graph transformers struggle to capture the long-range dependencies in these complex heterogeneous graphs. To address these two limitations, we present Poly-tokenized Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (PHGT), a novel transformer-based heterogeneous graph model. In addition to traditional node tokens, PHGT introduces a novel poly-token design with two more token types: semantic tokens and global tokens. Semantic tokens encapsulate high-order heterogeneous semantic relationships, while global tokens capture semantic-aware long-range interactions. We validate the effectiveness of PHGT through extensive experiments on standardized heterogeneous graph benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph representation learning models.">

        <tr id="Global environmental challenges and rising energy demands have led to extensive exploration of wind energy technologies. Accurate wind speed forecasting (WSF) is crucial for optimizing wind energy capture and ensuring system stability. However, predicting wind speed remains challenging due to its inherent randomness, fluctuation, and unpredictability. This study proposes the Temporal Convolutional Network Former (TCNFormer) for short-term (12-hour) wind speed forecasting. The TCNFormer integrates the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and transformer encoder to capture the spatio-temporal features of wind speed. The transformer encoder consists of two distinct attention mechanisms: causal temporal multi-head self-attention (CT-MSA) and temporal external attention (TEA). CT-MSA ensures that the output of a step derives only from previous steps, i.e., causality. Locality is also introduced to improve efficiency. TEA explores potential relationships between different sample sequences in wind speed data. This study utilizes wind speed data from the NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA POWER) of Patenga Sea Beach, Chittagong, Bangladesh (latitude 22.2352{\deg} N, longitude 91.7914{\deg} E) over a year (six seasons). The findings indicate that the TCNFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy. The proposed TCNFormer presents a promising method for spatio-temporal WSF and may achieve desirable performance in real-world applications of wind power systems.">

        <tr id="The non-stationary nature of real-world Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data presents forecasting models with a formidable challenge of the time-variant distribution of time series, referred to as distribution shift. Existing studies on the distribution shift mostly adhere to adaptive normalization techniques for alleviating temporal mean and covariance shifts or time-variant modeling for capturing temporal shifts. Despite improving model generalization, these normalization-based methods often assume a time-invariant transition between outputs and inputs but disregard specific intra-/inter-series correlations, while time-variant models overlook the intrinsic causes of the distribution shift. This limits model expressiveness and interpretability of tackling the distribution shift for MTS forecasting. To mitigate such a dilemma, we present a unified Probabilistic Graphical Model to Jointly capturing intra-/inter-series correlations and modeling the time-variant transitional distribution, and instantiate a neural framework called JointPGM for non-stationary MTS forecasting. Specifically, JointPGM first employs multiple Fourier basis functions to learn dynamic time factors and designs two distinct learners: intra-series and inter-series learners. The intra-series learner effectively captures temporal dynamics by utilizing temporal gates, while the inter-series learner explicitly models spatial dynamics through multi-hop propagation, incorporating Gumbel-softmax sampling. These two types of series dynamics are subsequently fused into a latent variable, which is inversely employed to infer time factors, generate final prediction, and perform reconstruction. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of JointPGM through extensive experiments on six highly non-stationary MTS datasets, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance of MTS forecasting.">

Although attention-based models have limitations in representing the individual influences of each variable, these models can influence the temporal dependencies in time series prediction and the magnitude of the influence of individual variables. To address this issue, this study introduced DLFormer, an attention-based architecture integrated with distributed lag embedding, to temporally embed individual variables and capture their temporal influence. Through validation against various real-world datasets, DLFormer showcased superior performance improvements compared to existing attention-based high-performance models.

The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture stands out for its ability to scale model size without significantly increasing training costs. Despite their advantages, current MoE models often display parameter inefficiency. For instance, a pre-trained MoE-based LLM with 52 billion parameters might perform comparably to a standard model with 6.7 billion parameters. Being a crucial part of MoE, current routers in different layers independently assign tokens without leveraging historical routing information, potentially leading to suboptimal token-expert combinations and the parameter inefficiency problem. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the Layerwise Recurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts (RMoE). RMoE leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to establish dependencies between routing decisions across consecutive layers. Such layerwise recurrence can be efficiently parallelly computed for input tokens and introduces negotiable costs. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RMoE-based language models consistently outperform a spectrum of baseline models. Furthermore, RMoE integrates a novel computation stage orthogonal to existing methods, allowing seamless compatibility with other MoE architectures. Our analyses attribute RMoE's gains to its effective cross-layer information sharing, which also improves expert selection and diversity. Our code is at https://github.com/qiuzh20/RMoE">
