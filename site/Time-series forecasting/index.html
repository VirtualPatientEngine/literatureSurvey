        <tr id="Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.">

        <tr id="In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different time points. Here, we introduce RAINDROP, a graph neural network that embeds irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. RAINDROP represents every sample as a separate sensor graph and models time-varying dependencies between sensors with a novel message passing operator. It estimates the latent sensor graph structure and leverages the structure together with nearby observations to predict misaligned readouts. This model can be interpreted as a graph neural network that sends messages over graphs that are optimized for capturing time-varying dependencies among sensors. We use RAINDROP to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. RAINDROP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.4% (absolute F1-score points), including techniques that deal with irregular sampling using fixed discretization and set functions. RAINDROP shows superiority in diverse setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have shown to be effective in time series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global) inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate predictions.">

        <tr id="Outstanding achievements of graph neural networks for spatiotemporal time series analysis show that relational constraints introduce an effective inductive bias into neural forecasting architectures. Often, however, the relational information characterizing the underlying data-generating process is unavailable and the practitioner is left with the problem of inferring from data which relational graph to use in the subsequent processing stages. We propose novel, principled - yet practical - probabilistic score-based methods that learn the relational dependencies as distributions over graphs while maximizing end-to-end the performance at task. The proposed graph learning framework is based on consolidated variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo score-based gradient estimation, is theoretically grounded, and, as we show, effective in practice. In this paper, we focus on the time series forecasting problem and show that, by tailoring the gradient estimators to the graph learning problem, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance while controlling the sparsity of the learned graph and the computational scalability. We empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that the proposed solution can be used as a stand-alone graph identification procedure as well as a graph learning component of an end-to-end forecasting architecture.">

        <tr id="Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic) graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed, recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions.">

        <tr id="By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.">

        <tr id="Attention mechanisms have been widely used to capture long-range dependencies among nodes in Graph Transformers. Bottlenecked by the quadratic computational cost, attention mechanisms fail to scale in large graphs. Recent improvements in computational efficiency are mainly achieved by attention sparsification with random or heuristic-based graph subsampling, which falls short in data-dependent context reasoning. State space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained prominence for their effectiveness and efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, adapting SSMs to non-sequential graph data presents a notable challenge. In this work, we introduce Graph-Mamba, the first attempt to enhance long-range context modeling in graph networks by integrating a Mamba block with the input-dependent node selection mechanism. Specifically, we formulate graph-centric node prioritization and permutation strategies to enhance context-aware reasoning, leading to a substantial improvement in predictive performance. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-range graph prediction tasks, with a fraction of the computational cost in both FLOPs and GPU memory consumption. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/Graph-Mamba.">

        <tr id="Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.">

        <tr id="Large pre-trained models excel in zero/few-shot learning for language and vision tasks but face challenges in multivariate time series (TS) forecasting due to diverse data characteristics. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1. Model weights for more sophisticated variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, and TTM-A) will be shared soon.

        <tr id="Pre-training on time series poses a unique challenge due to the potential mismatch between pre-training and target domains, such as shifts in temporal dynamics, fast-evolving trends, and long-range and short-cyclic effects, which can lead to poor downstream performance. While domain adaptation methods can mitigate these shifts, most methods need examples directly from the target domain, making them suboptimal for pre-training. To address this challenge, methods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and be capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training. Relative to other modalities, in time series, we expect that time-based and frequency-based representations of the same example are located close together in the time-frequency space. To this end, we posit that time-frequency consistency (TF-C) -- embedding a time-based neighborhood of an example close to its frequency-based neighborhood -- is desirable for pre-training. Motivated by TF-C, we define a decomposable pre-training model, where the self-supervised signal is provided by the distance between time and frequency components, each individually trained by contrastive estimation. We evaluate the new method on eight datasets, including electrodiagnostic testing, human activity recognition, mechanical fault detection, and physical status monitoring. Experiments against eight state-of-the-art methods show that TF-C outperforms baselines by 15.4% (F1 score) on average in one-to-one settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model on EMG data) and by 8.4% (precision) in challenging one-to-many settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model for either hand-gesture recognition or mechanical fault prediction), reflecting the breadth of scenarios that arise in real-world applications.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that Raincoat can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.">

The proposed AZ-test can be intended as a spatio-temporal extension of traditional tests designed for system identiﬁcation to graph signals. The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes over time, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as it is the case in many application scenarios like sensor and transportation networks. The asymptotic distribution of the designed test can be derived under the null hypothesis without assuming identically distributed data. We show the effectiveness of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and illustrate how it can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graph stream.">

The manuscript aims, for the first time, at filling this gap by matching state-space modeling and spatio-temporal data where the relational information, say the functional graph capturing latent dependencies, is learned directly from data and is allowed to change over time. Within a probabilistic formulation that accounts for the uncertainty in the data-generating process, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn the state-space model end-to-end on a downstream task.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a pivotal role in many real-world applications. Recently, the utilization of Large Language Models (LLM) in TSF has demonstrated exceptional predictive performance, surpassing most task-specific forecasting models. The success of LLM-based forecasting methods underscores the importance of causal dependence modeling and pre-trained knowledge transfer. However, challenges persist in directly applying LLM to TSF, i.e., the unacceptable parameter scales for resource-intensive model optimization, and the significant gap of feature space between structural numerical time series and natural language. To this end, we propose LeRet, a Language-empowered Retentive network for TSF. Technically, inspired by the causal extraction in LLM, we propose a causal dependence learner, enhanced by a patch-level pre-training task, to capture sequential causal evolution. To minimize the gap between numeric and language, we initialize a language description protocol for time series and design a TS-related language knowledge extractor to learn from language description, avoiding training with large-scale parameters. Finally, we dedicatedly achieve a Language-TS Modality Integrator for the fusion of two types data, and enable language-empowered sequence forecasting. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our LeRet, especially reveal superiority on few-shot, and zero-shot forecasting tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/hqh0728/LeRet.">

        <tr id="The self-attention mechanism in Transformer architecture, invariant to sequence order, necessitates positional embeddings to encode temporal order in time series prediction. We argue that this reliance on positional embeddings restricts the Transformer's ability to effectively represent temporal sequences, particularly when employing longer lookback windows. To address this, we introduce an innovative approach that combines Pyramid RNN embeddings(PRE) for univariate time series with the Transformer's capability to model multivariate dependencies. PRE, utilizing pyramidal one-dimensional convolutional layers, constructs multiscale convolutional features that preserve temporal order. Additionally, RNNs, layered atop these features, learn multiscale time series representations sensitive to sequence order. This integration into Transformer models with attention mechanisms results in significant performance enhancements. We present the PRformer, a model integrating PRE with a standard Transformer encoder, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets. This performance highlights the effectiveness of our approach in leveraging longer lookback windows and underscores the critical role of robust temporal representations in maximizing Transformer's potential for prediction tasks.

Different from other modalities, time series present unique challenges due to their complex and dynamic nature, including the entanglement of nonlinear patterns and time-variant trends. Analyzing time series data is of great significance in real-world scenarios and has been widely studied over centuries. Recent years have witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in the time series community, with techniques shifting from traditional statistical methods to advanced deep learning models. In this paper, we delve into the design of deep time series models across various analysis tasks and review the existing literature from two perspectives: basic modules and model architectures. Further, we develop and release Time Series Library (TSLib) as a fair benchmark of deep time series models for diverse analysis tasks, which implements 24 mainstream models, covers 30 datasets from different domains, and supports five prevalent analysis tasks. Based on TSLib, we thoroughly evaluate 12 advanced deep time series models on different tasks. Empirical results indicate that models with specific structures are well-suited for distinct analytical tasks, which offers insights for research and adoption of deep time series models.

        <tr id="Long time series forecasting aims to utilize historical information to forecast future states over extended horizons. Traditional RNN-based series forecasting methods struggle to effectively address long-term dependencies and gradient issues in long time series problems. Recently, SegRNN has emerged as a leading RNN-based model tailored for long-term series forecasting, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a streamlined architecture through innovative segmentation and parallel decoding techniques. Nevertheless, SegRNN has several limitations: its fixed segmentation disrupts data continuity and fails to effectively leverage information across different segments, the segmentation strategy employed by SegRNN does not fundamentally address the issue of information loss within the recurrent structure. To address these issues, we propose the ISMRNN method with three key enhancements: we introduce an implicit segmentation structure to decompose the time series and map it to segmented hidden states, resulting in denser information exchange during the segmentation phase. Additionally, we incorporate residual structures in the encoding layer to mitigate information loss within the recurrent structure. To extract information more effectively, we further integrate the Mamba architecture to enhance time series information extraction. Experiments on several real-world long time series forecasting datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art models.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have raised questions about the suitability of the Transformer architecture for long sequence time-series forecasting. These forecasting models leverage Transformers to capture dependencies between multiple time steps in a time series, with embedding tokens composed of data from individual time steps. However, challenges arise when applying Transformers to predict long sequences with strong periodicity, leading to performance degradation and increased computational burden. Furthermore, embedding tokens formed one time step at a time may struggle to reveal meaningful information in long sequences, failing to capture correlations between different time steps. In this study, we propose Skip-Timeformer, a Transformer-based model that utilizes a skip-time interaction for long sequence time-series forecasting. Specifically, we decompose the time series into multiple subsequences based on different time intervals, embedding various time steps into variable tokens across multiple sequences. The skip-time interaction mechanism utilizes these variable tokens to capture dependencies in the skip-time dimension. Additionally, skip-time interaction is employed to learn dependencies between sequences missed by multiple skip time steps. The Skip-Timeformer model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets, further enhancing the long sequence forecasting capabilities of the Transformer variations and better adapting to arbitrary lookback windows.">

In this paper, we propose a model for better forecasting time series: Decoupled Invariant Attention Network (DIAN), which contains two modules to learn spatial and temporal relationships respectively: 1) Spatial Decoupled Invariant-Variant Learning (SDIVL) to decouple the spatial invariant and variant attention scores, and then leverage convolutional networks to effectively integrate them for subsequent layers; 2) Temporal Augmented Invariant-Variant Learning (TAIVL) to decouple temporal invariant and variant patterns and combine them for further forecasting.In this module, we also design Temporal Intervention Mechanism to create multiple intervened samples by reassembling variant patterns across time stamps to eliminate the spurious impacts of variant patterns.In addition, we propose Joint Optimization to minimize the loss function considering all invariant patterns, variant patterns and intervened patterns so that our model can gain a more stable predictive ability.Extensive experiments on five datasets have demonstrated our superior performance with higher efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.">

        <tr id="Deep models for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting have recently demonstrated significant success. Channel-dependent models capture complex dependencies that channel-independent models cannot capture. However, the number of channels in real-world applications outpaces the capabilities of existing channel-dependent models, and contrary to common expectations, some models underperform the channel-independent models in handling high-dimensional data, which raises questions about the performance of channel-dependent models. To address this, our study first investigates the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of these channel-dependent models on high-dimensional MTS data. Our analysis reveals that two primary issues lie in the introduced noise from unrelated series that increases the difficulty of capturing the crucial inter-channel dependencies, and challenges in training strategies due to high-dimensional data. To address these issues, we propose STHD, the Scalable Transformer for High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting. STHD has three components: a) Relation Matrix Sparsity that limits the noise introduced and alleviates the memory issue; b) ReIndex applied as a training strategy to enable a more flexible batch size setting and increase the diversity of training data; and c) Transformer that handles 2-D inputs and captures channel dependencies. These components jointly enable STHD to manage the high-dimensional MTS while maintaining computational feasibility. Furthermore, experimental results show STHD's considerable improvement on three high-dimensional datasets: Crime-Chicago, Wiki-People, and Traffic.

Recent works model the relations between time-series as graphs and have shown that propagating information over the relation graph can improve time series forecasting. However, in many cases, relational information is not available or is noisy and reliable. Moreover, most works ignore the underlying uncertainty of time-series both for structure learning and deriving the forecasts resulting in the structure not capturing the uncertainty resulting in forecast distributions with poor uncertainty estimates. We tackle this challenge and introduce STOIC, that leverages stochastic correlations between time-series to learn underlying structure between time-series and to provide well-calibrated and accurate forecasts. Over a wide-range of benchmark datasets STOIC provides around 16% more accurate and 14% better-calibrated forecasts. STOIC also shows better adaptation to noise in data during inference and captures important and useful relational information in various benchmarks.">

        <tr id="This technical report describes the Time Series Optimized Transformer for Observability (Toto), a new state of the art foundation model for time series forecasting developed by Datadog. In addition to advancing the state of the art on generalized time series benchmarks in domains such as electricity and weather, this model is the first general-purpose time series forecasting foundation model to be specifically tuned for observability metrics. Toto was trained on a dataset of one trillion time series data points, the largest among all currently published time series foundation models. Alongside publicly available time series datasets, 75% of the data used to train Toto consists of fully anonymous numerical metric data points from the Datadog platform. In our experiments, Toto outperforms existing time series foundation models on observability data. It does this while also excelling at general-purpose forecasting tasks, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple open benchmark datasets.">

        <tr id="Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.">

        <tr id="It is challenging to scale time series forecasting models such that they forecast accurately for multiple distinct domains and datasets, all with potentially different underlying collection procedures (e.g., sample resolution), patterns (e.g., periodicity), and prediction requirements (e.g., reconstruction vs. forecasting). We call this general task universal forecasting. Existing methods usually assume that input data is regularly sampled, and they forecast to pre-determined horizons, resulting in failure to generalise outside of the scope of their training. We propose the DAM - a neural model that takes randomly sampled histories and outputs an adjustable basis composition as a continuous function of time for forecasting to non-fixed horizons. It involves three key components: (1) a flexible approach for using randomly sampled histories from a long-tail distribution, that enables an efficient global perspective of the underlying temporal dynamics while retaining focus on the recent history; (2) a transformer backbone that is trained on these actively sampled histories to produce, as representational output, (3) the basis coefficients of a continuous function of time. We show that a single univariate DAM, trained on 25 time series datasets, either outperformed or closely matched existing SoTA models at multivariate long-term forecasting across 18 datasets, including 8 held-out for zero-shot transfer, even though these models were trained to specialise for each dataset-horizon combination. This single DAM excels at zero-shot transfer and very-long-term forecasting, performs well at imputation, is interpretable via basis function composition and attention, can be tuned for different inference-cost requirements, is robust to missing and irregularly sampled data {by design}.">

        <tr id="Spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation are important for real-world dynamic systems such as intelligent transportation, urban planning, and public health. Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their development in understanding spatial-temporal data has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-LLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{LLM}s, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-LLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers as well as virtual nodes. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for LLMs to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data. Additionally, to capture the non-pairwise and higher-order correlations, we design a hypergraph learning module for LLMs, which can enhance the overall performance and improve efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-LLM exhibits strong performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-LLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot learning tasks.">

        <tr id="In multivariate time-series forecasting (MTSF), extracting the temporal correlations of the input sequences is crucial. While popular Transformer-based predictive models can perform well, their quadratic computational complexity results in inefficiency and high overhead. The recently emerged Mamba, a selective state space model, has shown promising results in many fields due to its strong temporal feature extraction capabilities and linear computational complexity. However, due to the unilateral nature of Mamba, channel-independent predictive models based on Mamba cannot attend to the relationships among all variables in the manner of Transformer-based models. To address this issue, we combine fast-attention with Mamba to introduce a novel framework named FMamba for MTSF. Technically, we first extract the temporal features of the input variables through an embedding layer, then compute the dependencies among input variables via the fast-attention module. Subsequently, we use Mamba to selectively deal with the input features and further extract the temporal dependencies of the variables through the multi-layer perceptron block (MLP-block). Finally, FMamba obtains the predictive results through the projector, a linear layer. Experimental results on eight public datasets demonstrate that FMamba can achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational overhead.">

        <tr id="Discrete-Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs), which are prevalent in real-world implementations and notable for their ease of data acquisition, have garnered considerable attention from both academic researchers and industry practitioners. The representation learning of DTDGs has been extensively applied to model the dynamics of temporally changing entities and their evolving connections. Currently, DTDG representation learning predominantly relies on GNN+RNN architectures, which manifest the inherent limitations of both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). GNNs suffer from the over-smoothing issue as the models architecture goes deeper, while RNNs struggle to capture long-term dependencies effectively. GNN+RNN architectures also grapple with scaling to large graph sizes and long sequences. Additionally, these methods often compute node representations separately and focus solely on individual node characteristics, thereby overlooking the behavior intersections between the two nodes whose link is being predicted, such as instances where the two nodes appear together in the same context or share common neighbors. This paper introduces a novel representation learning method DTFormer for DTDGs, pivoting from the traditional GNN+RNN framework to a Transformer-based architecture. Our approach exploits the attention mechanism to concurrently process topological information within the graph at each timestamp and temporal dynamics of graphs along the timestamps, circumventing the aforementioned fundamental weakness of both GNNs and RNNs. Moreover, we enhance the model's expressive capability by incorporating the intersection relationships among nodes and integrating a multi-patching module. Extensive experiments conducted on six public dynamic graph benchmark datasets confirm our model's efficacy, achieving the SOTA performance.">

These modifications substantially enhance sLSTM's performance in TSF, achieving state-of-the-art results.

        <tr id="Exploiting self-supervised learning (SSL) to extract the universal representations of time series could not only capture the natural properties of time series but also offer huge help to the downstream tasks. Nevertheless, existing time series representation learning (TSRL) methods face challenges in attaining universality. Indeed, existing methods relying solely on one SSL strategy (either contrastive learning (CL) or generative) often fall short in capturing rich semantic information for various downstream tasks. Moreover, time series exhibit diverse distributions and inherent characteristics, particularly with the common occurrence of missing values, posing a notable challenge for existing backbones in effectively handling such diverse time series data. To bridge these gaps, we propose CTRL, a framework for universal TSRL. For the first time, we employ Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) as the backbone for TSRL, which captures the continuous processes and exhibits robustness to missing data. Additionally, a dual-task SSL strategy, integrating both reconstruction and contrasting tasks, is proposed to enrich the semantic information of the learned representations. Furthermore, novel hard negative construction and false negative elimination mechanisms are proposed to improve sampling efficiency and reduce sampling bias in CL. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CTRL in forecasting, classification, and imputation tasks, particularly its outstanding robustness to missing data.">

We assess the performance of LLMTIME across multiple datasets and introduce classical almost periodic functions as time series to gauge its effectiveness. The empirical results indicate that while large language models can perform well in zero-shot forecasting for certain datasets, their predictive accuracy diminishes notably when confronted with diverse time series data and traditional signals.

        <tr id="Short fixed-length inputs are the main bottleneck of deep learning methods in long time-series forecasting tasks. Prolonging input length causes overfitting, rapidly deteriorating accuracy. Our research indicates that the overfitting is a combination reaction of the multi-scale pattern coupling in time series and the fixed focusing scale of current models. First, we find that the patterns exhibited by a time series across various scales are reflective of its multi-periodic nature, where each scale corresponds to specific period length. Second, We find that the token size predominantly dictates model behavior, as it determines the scale at which the model focuses and the context size it can accommodate. Our idea is to decouple the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series and to model each pattern with its corresponding period length as token size. We introduced a novel series-decomposition module(MPSD), and a Multi-Token Pattern Recognition neural network(MTPR), enabling the model to handle \textit{inputs up to $10\times$ longer}.

        <tr id="Transformer has gained widespread adoption in modeling time series due to the exceptional ability of its self-attention mechanism in capturing long-range dependencies. However, when processing time series data with numerous variates, the vanilla self-attention mechanism tends to distribute attention weights evenly and smoothly, causing row-homogenization in attention maps and further hampering time series forecasting. To tackle this issue, we propose an advanced Transformer architecture entitled SDformer, which designs two novel modules, Spectral-Filter-Transform (SFT) and Dynamic-Directional-Attention (DDA), and integrates them into the encoder of Transformer to achieve more intensive attention allocation. Specifically, the SFT module utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform to select the most prominent frequencies, along with a Hamming Window to smooth and denoise the filtered series data; The DDA module applies a specialized kernel function to the query and key vectors projected from the denoised data, concentrating this innovative attention mechanism more effectively on the most informative variates to obtain a sharper attention distribution. These two modules jointly enable attention weights to be more salient among numerous variates, which in turn enhances the attention's ability to capture multivariate correlations, improving the performance in forecasting. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate its superior performance over other state-of-the-art models. Code is available at https://github.com/zhouziyu02/SDformer.">

It employs the Fourier transform for embedding and introduces Multi-head Spectrum Scaling (MSS) to replace the conventional linear mapping of Q and K. FSatten can accurately capture the periodic dependencies between sequences and outperform the conventional attention without changing mainstream architectures. We further design a more general method dubbed Scaled Orthogonal attention (SOatten). We propose an orthogonal embedding and a Head-Coupling Convolution (HCC) based on the neighboring similarity bias to guide the model in learning comprehensive dependency patterns. Experiments show that FSatten and SOatten surpass the SOTA which uses conventional attention, making it a good alternative as a basic attention mechanism for MTSF. The codes and log files will be released at: https://github.com/Joeland4/FSatten-SOatten.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks have shown widespread success for learning on graphs, but they still face fundamental drawbacks, such as limited expressive power, over-smoothing, and over-squashing. Meanwhile, the transformer architecture offers a potential solution to these issues. However, existing graph transformers primarily cater to homogeneous graphs and are unable to model the intricate semantics of heterogeneous graphs. Moreover, unlike small molecular graphs where the entire graph can be considered as the receptive field in graph transformers, real-world heterogeneous graphs comprise a significantly larger number of nodes and cannot be entirely treated as such. Consequently, existing graph transformers struggle to capture the long-range dependencies in these complex heterogeneous graphs. To address these two limitations, we present Poly-tokenized Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (PHGT), a novel transformer-based heterogeneous graph model. In addition to traditional node tokens, PHGT introduces a novel poly-token design with two more token types: semantic tokens and global tokens. Semantic tokens encapsulate high-order heterogeneous semantic relationships, while global tokens capture semantic-aware long-range interactions. We validate the effectiveness of PHGT through extensive experiments on standardized heterogeneous graph benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph representation learning models.">

        <tr id="The non-stationary nature of real-world Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data presents forecasting models with a formidable challenge of the time-variant distribution of time series, referred to as distribution shift. Existing studies on the distribution shift mostly adhere to adaptive normalization techniques for alleviating temporal mean and covariance shifts or time-variant modeling for capturing temporal shifts. Despite improving model generalization, these normalization-based methods often assume a time-invariant transition between outputs and inputs but disregard specific intra-/inter-series correlations, while time-variant models overlook the intrinsic causes of the distribution shift. This limits model expressiveness and interpretability of tackling the distribution shift for MTS forecasting. To mitigate such a dilemma, we present a unified Probabilistic Graphical Model to Jointly capturing intra-/inter-series correlations and modeling the time-variant transitional distribution, and instantiate a neural framework called JointPGM for non-stationary MTS forecasting. Specifically, JointPGM first employs multiple Fourier basis functions to learn dynamic time factors and designs two distinct learners: intra-series and inter-series learners. The intra-series learner effectively captures temporal dynamics by utilizing temporal gates, while the inter-series learner explicitly models spatial dynamics through multi-hop propagation, incorporating Gumbel-softmax sampling. These two types of series dynamics are subsequently fused into a latent variable, which is inversely employed to infer time factors, generate final prediction, and perform reconstruction. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of JointPGM through extensive experiments on six highly non-stationary MTS datasets, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance of MTS forecasting.">

Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.">

Previously, forecasts in financial markets have been approached in two main ways: either as time-series problems over price sequence or sentiment analysis tasks. The sentiment analysis tasks aim to determine whether news events will have a positive or negative impact on stock prices, often categorizing them into discrete labels. Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to accurately model time series prediction, we propose a collaborative modeling framework that incorporates textual information about relevant events for predictions.

Its performance is, however, heavily dependent on input data preprocessing and output data evaluation, justifying a data-centric approach to future research.

The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture stands out for its ability to scale model size without significantly increasing training costs. Despite their advantages, current MoE models often display parameter inefficiency. For instance, a pre-trained MoE-based LLM with 52 billion parameters might perform comparably to a standard model with 6.7 billion parameters. Being a crucial part of MoE, current routers in different layers independently assign tokens without leveraging historical routing information, potentially leading to suboptimal token-expert combinations and the parameter inefficiency problem. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the Layerwise Recurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts (RMoE). RMoE leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to establish dependencies between routing decisions across consecutive layers. Such layerwise recurrence can be efficiently parallelly computed for input tokens and introduces negotiable costs. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RMoE-based language models consistently outperform a spectrum of baseline models. Furthermore, RMoE integrates a novel computation stage orthogonal to existing methods, allowing seamless compatibility with other MoE architectures. Our analyses attribute RMoE's gains to its effective cross-layer information sharing, which also improves expert selection and diversity. Our code is at https://github.com/qiuzh20/RMoE">

So far, recurrent networks, convolution networks and transformer-style models have been successively applied in temporal data representation, yielding notable results. However, most existing methods primarily focus on modeling and representing the variation patterns within time series in the time domain. As a highly abstracted information entity, 1D time series couples various patterns such as trends, seasonality, and dramatic changes (instantaneous high dynamic), it is difficult to exploit these highly coupled properties merely by analysis tools on purely time domain. To this end, we present Spectrogram Analysis and Representation Network (SpecAR-Net). SpecAR-Net aims at learning more comprehensive representations by modeling raw time series in both time and frequency domain, where an efficient joint extraction of time-frequency features is achieved through a group of learnable 2D multi-scale parallel complex convolution blocks. Experimental results show that the SpecAR-Net achieves excellent performance on 5 major downstream tasks i.e., classification, anomaly detection, imputation, long- and short-term forecasting.

To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases.

For instance, forecasting power time series can optimize energy usage and bolster grid stability and reliability. Existing models based on transformer architecture are limited to classical design, ignoring the impact of spatial information and noise on model architecture design. Therefore, we propose an atypical design of Transformer-based models for multivariate time series forecasting. This design consists of two critical components: (i) spectral clustering center of time series employed as the focal point for attention computation; (ii) alternating attention mechanism wherein each query transformer is compatible with spectral clustering centers, executing attention at the sequence level instead of the token level. The alternating design has a two-fold benefit: firstly, it eliminates the uncertainty noise present in the dependent variable sequence of the channel input, and secondly, it incorporates the Euclidean distance to mitigate the impact of extreme values on the attention matrix, thereby aligning predictions more closely to the sequence's natural progression. Experiments on ten real-world datasets, encompassing Wind, Electricity, Weather, and others, demonstrate that our Spectral Central Alternating Transformer (SCAT) outperforms state-of-the-art methods (SOTA) by an average of 42.8% in prediction performance in power time series forecasting.">

Time series forecasting techniques have been developing in parallel with the machine learning community, from early statistical learning methods to current deep learning methods. Although existing methods have made significant progress, they still suffer from two challenges. The mathematical theory of mainstream deep learning-based methods does not establish a clear relation between network sizes and fitting capabilities, and these methods often lack interpretability. To this end, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into time series forecasting research, which has better mathematical properties and interpretability. First, we propose the Reversible Mixture of KAN experts (RMoK) model, which is a KAN-based model for time series forecasting. RMoK uses a mixture-of-experts structure to assign variables to KAN experts. Then, we compare performance, integration, and speed between RMoK and various baselines on real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that RMoK achieves the best performance in most cases. And we find the relationship between temporal feature weights and data periodicity through visualization, which roughly explains RMoK's mechanism. Thus, we conclude that KAN and KAN-based models (RMoK) are effective in time series forecasting. Code is available at KAN4TSF: https://github.com/2448845600/KAN4TSF.">

Graph foundation models offer a transformative solution, with the potential to learn robust, generalizable representations from graph data. This enables more effective and adaptable applications across a wide spectrum of tasks and domains. In this work, we investigate a unified graph model, AnyGraph, designed to handle key challenges: i) Structure Heterogenity. Addressing distribution shift in graph structural information; ii) Feature Heterogenity. Handling diverse feature representation spaces across graph datasets; iii) Fast Adaptation. Efficiently adapting the model to new graph domains; iv) Scaling Law Emergence. Enabling the model to exhibit scaling law behavior, where its performance scales favorably with the amount of data and parameter sizes. To tackle these critical challenges, we build the AnyGraph upon a Graph Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This approach empowers the model to effectively manage both the in-domain and cross-domain distribution shift concerning structure-level and feature-level heterogeneity. Furthermore, a lightweight graph expert routing mechanism is proposed to facilitate AnyGraph's fast adaptability to new data and domains. Our extensive experiments on diverse 38 graph datasets have demonstrated the strong zero-shot learning performance of AnyGraph across diverse graph domains with significant distribution shift. Furthermore, we have validated the model's fast adaptation ability and scaling law emergence, showcasing its versatility.">

        <tr id="Temporal graphs have gained increasing importance due to their ability to model dynamically evolving relationships. These graphs can be represented through either a stream of edge events or a sequence of graph snapshots. Until now, the development of machine learning methods for both types has occurred largely in isolation, resulting in limited experimental comparison and theoretical crosspollination between the two. In this paper, we introduce Unified Temporal Graph (UTG), a framework that unifies snapshot-based and event-based machine learning models under a single umbrella, enabling models developed for one representation to be applied effectively to datasets of the other. We also propose a novel UTG training procedure to boost the performance of snapshot-based models in the streaming setting. We comprehensively evaluate both snapshot and event-based models across both types of temporal graphs on the temporal link prediction task. Our main findings are threefold: first, when combined with UTG training, snapshotbased models can perform competitively with event-based models such as TGN and GraphMixer even on event datasets. Second, snapshot-based models are at least an order of magnitude faster than most event-based models during inference. Third, while event-based methods such as NAT and DyGFormer outperforms snapshotbased methods on both types of temporal graphs, this is because they leverage joint neighborhood structural features thus emphasizing the potential to incorporate these features into snapshot-based models as well. These findings highlight the importance of comparing model architectures independent of the data format and suggest the potential of combining the efficiency of snapshot-based models with the performance of event-based models in the future.">

        <tr id="The Variable Subset Forecasting (VSF) problem, where the majority of variables are unavailable in the inference stage of multivariate forecasting, has been an important but under-explored task with broad impacts in many real-world applications. Missing values, absent inter-correlation, and the impracticality of retraining largely hinder the ability of multivariate forecasting models to capture inherent relationships among variables, impacting their performance. However, existing approaches towards these issues either heavily rely on local temporal correlation or face limitations in fully recovering missing information from the unavailable subset, accompanied by notable computational expenses. To address these problems, we propose a novel density estimation solution to recover the information of missing variables via flows-based generative framework. In particular, a novel generative network for time series, namely Time-series Reconstruction Flows (TRF), is proposed to estimate and reconstruct the missing variable subset. In addition, a novel meta-training framework, Variable-Agnostic Meta Learning, has been developed to enhance the generalization ability of TRF, enabling it to adapt to diverse missing variables situations. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with baseline methods.">

        <tr id="Recently, the emerging graph Transformers have made significant advancements for node classification on graphs. In most graph Transformers, a crucial step involves transforming the input graph into token sequences as the model input, enabling Transformer to effectively learn the node representations. However, we observe that existing methods only express partial graph information of nodes through single-type token generation. Consequently, they require tailored strategies to encode additional graph-specific features into the Transformer to ensure the quality of node representation learning, limiting the model flexibility to handle diverse graphs. To this end, we propose a new graph Transformer called NTFormer to address this issue. NTFormer introduces a novel token generator called Node2Par, which constructs various token sequences using different token elements for each node. This flexibility allows Node2Par to generate valuable token sequences from different perspectives, ensuring comprehensive expression of rich graph features. Benefiting from the merits of Node2Par, NTFormer only leverages a Transformer-based backbone without graph-specific modifications to learn node representations, eliminating the need for graph-specific modifications. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets containing homophily and heterophily graphs with different scales demonstrate the superiority of NTFormer over representative graph Transformers and graph neural networks for node classification.">

While it has shown promise in tasks like sentiment classification and natural language inference, generating suitable prompts for PLMs, as opposed to human prompts, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce an abstraction of the prompt learning process using an extended Kalman filter. Our approach, called Conditional Extended Kalman Filter based on Neural Networks (CEKFNN), effectively infers more appropriate prompt tokens by enhancing the classic extended Kalman filter with PLM's contextual representation power. Specifically, CEKFNN learns transition and emission functions from PLM embeddings of input sentences to infer latent prompt tokens. We refine CEKFNN using an alternate-training approach, retraining a PLM's emission function with prompt tokens inferred by prompt models (PMs), as well as the initial and transition functions. PLM's output labels assist in PMs' training. When updating the pre-trained language model (PLM), we use an adapter approach with few trainable parameters, leaving PLM parameters frozen. We evaluate CEKFNN across open-source PLMs, demonstrating performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods while using a limited number of trainable parameters. It shows that CEKFNN performs on-par or better than fine-tuning, which requires updating all parameters in the PLM.">

        <tr id="While most time series are non-stationary, it is inevitable for models to face the distribution shift issue in time series forecasting. Existing solutions manipulate statistical measures (usually mean and std.) to adjust time series distribution. However, these operations can be theoretically seen as the transformation towards zero frequency component of the spectrum which cannot reveal full distribution information and would further lead to information utilization bottleneck in normalization, thus hindering forecasting performance. To address this problem, we propose to utilize the whole frequency spectrum to transform time series to make full use of data distribution from the frequency perspective. We present a deep frequency derivative learning framework, DERITS, for non-stationary time series forecasting. Specifically, DERITS is built upon a novel reversible transformation, namely Frequency Derivative Transformation (FDT) that makes signals derived in the frequency domain to acquire more stationary frequency representations. Then, we propose the Order-adaptive Fourier Convolution Network to conduct adaptive frequency filtering and learning. Furthermore, we organize DERITS as a parallel-stacked architecture for the multi-order derivation and fusion for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several datasets which show the consistent superiority in both time series forecasting and shift alleviation.">

        <tr id="Human mobility is intricately influenced by urban contexts spatially and temporally, constituting essential domain knowledge in understanding traffic systems. While existing traffic forecasting models primarily rely on raw traffic data and advanced deep learning techniques, incorporating contextual information remains underexplored due to the lack of effective integration frameworks and the complexity of urban contexts. This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed using these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG's configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model surpasses benchmark models, achieving an average MAE of $3.46\pm0.01$ and a MAPE of $14.76\pm0.09\%$ for traffic speed predictions from 10 to 120 minutes. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model's ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. The CKG framework's model-agnostic nature suggests its potential applicability in various applications of intelligent transportation systems. Overall, this study underscores the importance of incorporating domain-specific contexts into traffic forecasting and merging context-aware knowledge graphs with neural networks to enhance accuracy.">

Despite the tussle between performance degradation due to the oversmoothing of learned embeddings and long-range dependency being more pronounced in dynamic graphs, as features are aggregated both across neighborhood and time, no prior work has proposed an implicit graph neural model in a dynamic setting. In this paper, we present Implicit Dynamic Graph Neural Network (IDGNN) a novel implicit neural network for dynamic graphs which is the first of its kind. A key characteristic of IDGNN is that it demonstrably is well-posed, i.e., it is theoretically guaranteed to have a fixed-point representation. We then demonstrate that the standard iterative algorithm often used to train implicit models is computationally expensive in our dynamic setting as it involves computing gradients, which themselves have to be estimated in an iterative manner. To overcome this, we pose an equivalent bilevel optimization problem and propose an efficient single-loop training algorithm that avoids iterative computation by maintaining moving averages of key components of the gradients. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets on both classification and regression tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art baselines.

        <tr id="Hierarchical time-series forecasting (HTSF) is an important problem for many real-world business applications where the goal is to simultaneously forecast multiple time-series that are related to each other via a hierarchical relation. Recent works, however, do not address two important challenges that are typically observed in many demand forecasting applications at large companies. First, many time-series at lower levels of the hierarchy have high sparsity i.e., they have a significant number of zeros. Most HTSF methods do not address this varying sparsity across the hierarchy. Further, they do not scale well to the large size of the real-world hierarchy typically unseen in benchmarks used in literature. We resolve both these challenges by proposing HAILS, a novel probabilistic hierarchical model that enables accurate and calibrated probabilistic forecasts across the hierarchy by adaptively modeling sparse and dense time-series with different distributional assumptions and reconciling them to adhere to hierarchical constraints. We show the scalability and effectiveness of our methods by evaluating them against real-world demand forecasting datasets. We deploy HAILS at a large chemical manufacturing company for a product demand forecasting application with over ten thousand products and observe a significant 8.5\% improvement in forecast accuracy and 23% better improvement for sparse time-series. The enhanced accuracy and scalability make HAILS a valuable tool for improved business planning and customer experience.">

        <tr id="By learning expressive representations, deep learning (DL) has revolutionized autonomous driving (AD). Despite significant advancements, the inherent opacity of DL models engenders public distrust, impeding their widespread adoption. For explainable autonomous driving, current studies primarily concentrate on extracting features from input scenes to predict driving actions and their corresponding explanations. However, these methods underutilize semantics and correlation information within actions and explanations (collectively called categories in this work), leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Correlation Learning (SGDCL), a novel approach that effectively exploits semantic richness and dynamic interactions intrinsic to categories. SGDCL employs a semantic-guided learning module to obtain category-specific representations and a dynamic correlation learning module to adaptively capture intricate correlations among categories. Additionally, we introduce an innovative loss term to leverage fine-grained co-occurrence statistics of categories for refined regularization. We extensively evaluate SGDCL on two well-established benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority over seven state-of-the-art baselines and a large vision-language model. SGDCL significantly promotes explainable autonomous driving with up to 15.3% performance improvement and interpretable attention scores, bolstering public trust in AD.">

        <tr id="Despite the success of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) in modeling real-world Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), challenges such as expressiveness limitations and over-smoothing have prompted researchers to explore Graph Transformers (GTs) for enhanced HIN representation learning. However, research on GT in HINs remains limited, with two key shortcomings in existing work: (1) A node's neighbors at different distances in HINs convey diverse semantics. Unfortunately, existing methods ignore such differences and uniformly treat neighbors within a given distance in a coarse manner, which results in semantic confusion. (2) Nodes in HINs have various types, each with unique semantics. Nevertheless, existing methods mix nodes of different types during neighbor aggregation, hindering the capture of proper correlations between nodes of diverse types. To bridge these gaps, we design an innovative structure named (k,t)-ring neighborhood, where nodes are initially organized by their distance, forming different non-overlapping k-ring neighborhoods for each distance. Within each k-ring structure, nodes are further categorized into different groups according to their types, thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of both distances and types in HINs naturally. Based on this structure, we propose a novel Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HHGT) model, which seamlessly integrates a Type-level Transformer for aggregating nodes of different types within each k-ring neighborhood, followed by a Ring-level Transformer for aggregating different k-ring neighborhoods in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on downstream tasks to verify HHGT's superiority over 14 baselines, with a notable improvement of up to 24.75% in NMI and 29.25% in ARI for node clustering task on the ACM dataset compared to the best baseline.">

        <tr id="Time series classification with missing data is a prevalent issue in time series analysis, as temporal data often contain missing values in practical applications. The traditional two-stage approach, which handles imputation and classification separately, can result in sub-optimal performance as label information is not utilized in the imputation process. On the other hand, a one-stage approach can learn features under missing information, but feature representation is limited as imputed errors are propagated in the classification process. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end neural network that unifies data imputation and representation learning within a single framework, allowing the imputation process to take advantage of label information. Differing from previous methods, our approach places less emphasis on the accuracy of imputation data and instead prioritizes classification performance. A specifically designed multi-scale feature learning module is implemented to extract useful information from the noise-imputation data. The proposed model is evaluated on 68 univariate time series datasets from the UCR archive, as well as a multivariate time series dataset with various missing data ratios and 4 real-world datasets with missing information. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for incomplete time series classification, particularly in scenarios with high levels of missing data.">

        <tr id="Language models have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. However, their application to time series data, a crucial component in many domains, remains limited. This paper proposes LiPCoT (Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series), a novel tokenizer that encodes time series data into a sequence of tokens, enabling self-supervised learning of time series using existing Language model architectures such as BERT. Unlike traditional time series tokenizers that rely heavily on CNN encoder for time series feature generation, LiPCoT employs stochastic modeling through linear predictive coding to create a latent space for time series providing a compact yet rich representation of the inherent stochastic nature of the data. Furthermore, LiPCoT is computationally efficient and can effectively handle time series data with varying sampling rates and lengths, overcoming common limitations of existing time series tokenizers. In this proof-of-concept work, we present the effectiveness of LiPCoT in classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) using an EEG dataset from 46 participants. In particular, we utilize LiPCoT to encode EEG data into a small vocabulary of tokens and then use BERT for self-supervised learning and the downstream task of PD classification. We benchmark our approach against several state-of-the-art CNN-based deep learning architectures for PD detection. Our results reveal that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning outperformed the best-performing existing method by 7.1% in precision, 2.3% in recall, 5.5% in accuracy, 4% in AUC, and 5% in F1-score highlighting the potential for self-supervised learning even on small datasets. Our work will inform future foundational models for time series, particularly for self-supervised learning.">

We train up to 1.5B parameter class models of the Finch, Llama, and GoldFinch architectures, and find dramatically improved modeling performance relative to both Finch and Llama. Our cache size savings increase linearly with model layer count, ranging from 756-2550 times smaller than the traditional transformer cache for common sizes, enabling inference of extremely large context lengths even on limited hardware. Although autoregressive generation has O(n) time complexity per token because of attention, pre-fill computation of the entire initial cache state for a submitted context costs only O(1) time per token due to the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate this cache.

Being the most pivotal in the computer vision domain, latent diffusion models have also recently attracted interest in other communities, including NLP, Speech, and Geometric Space. In this work, we propose TimeLDM, a novel latent diffusion model for high-quality time series generation. TimeLDM is composed of a variational autoencoder that encodes time series into an informative and smoothed latent content and a latent diffusion model operating in the latent space to generate latent information. We evaluate the ability of our method to generate synthetic time series with simulated and realistic datasets, benchmark the performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed TimeLDM persistently delivers high-quality generated time series. Sores from Context-FID and Discriminative indicate that TimeLDM consistently and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art benchmarks with an average improvement of 3.4$\times$ and 3.8$\times$, respectively. Further studies demonstrate that our method presents better performance on different lengths of time series data generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the potential of the latent diffusion model for unconditional time series generation and establish a new baseline for synthetic time series.">

        <tr id="One of the fundamental representation learning tasks is unsupervised sequential disentanglement, where latent codes of inputs are decomposed to a single static factor and a sequence of dynamic factors. To extract this latent information, existing methods condition the static and dynamic codes on the entire input sequence. Unfortunately, these models often suffer from information leakage, i.e., the dynamic vectors encode both static and dynamic information, or vice versa, leading to a non-disentangled representation. Attempts to alleviate this problem via reducing the dynamic dimension and auxiliary loss terms gain only partial success. Instead, we propose a novel and simple architecture that mitigates information leakage by offering a simple and effective subtraction inductive bias while conditioning on a single sample. Remarkably, the resulting variational framework is simpler in terms of required loss terms, hyperparameters, and data augmentation. We evaluate our method on multiple data-modality benchmarks including general time series, video, and audio, and we show beyond state-of-the-art results on generation and prediction tasks in comparison to several strong baselines.">

By synthesizing these two modules, STEN learns expressive spatial-temporal representations for the normal patterns hidden in the time series data. Extensive experiments on five popular TSAD benchmarks show that STEN substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/STEN.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has played an important role in different industries, including economics, energy, weather, and healthcare. RNN-based methods have shown promising potential due to their strong ability to model the interaction of time and variables. However, they are prone to gradient issues like gradient explosion and vanishing gradients. And the prediction accuracy is not high. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Fractional-order Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Network with a Frequency-domain Gated Attention mechanism (FLRNN-FGA). There are three major components: the Fractional-order Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Network (FLRNN), frequency module, and gated attention mechanism. In the FLRNN, fractional-order integration is employed to describe the dynamic systems accurately. It can capture long-term dependencies and improve prediction accuracy. Lipschitz weight matrices are applied to alleviate the gradient issues. In the frequency module, temporal data are transformed into the frequency domain by Fourier transform. Frequency domain processing can reduce the computational complexity of the model. In the gated attention mechanism, the gated structure can regulate attention information transmission to reduce the number of model parameters. Extensive experimental results on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLRNN-FGA compared with the state-of-the-art methods.">

        <tr id="Graphs have emerged as critical data structures for content analysis in various domains, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and recommendation systems. Node classification, a fundamental task in this context, is typically tackled using graph neural networks (GNNs). Unfortunately, conventional GNNs still face challenges in scenarios with few labeled nodes, despite the prevalence of few-shot node classification tasks in real-world applications. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed, including graph meta-learning, transfer learning, and methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs). However, traditional meta-learning and transfer learning methods often require prior knowledge from base classes or fail to exploit the potential advantages of unlabeled nodes. Meanwhile, LLM-based methods may overlook the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs and rely heavily on the quality of generated contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates LLMs and GNNs, leveraging the zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities of LLMs and employing a Graph-LLM-based active learning paradigm to enhance GNNs' performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in improving node classification accuracy with considerably limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.">

        <tr id="Causal discovery from time-series data aims to capture both intra-slice (contemporaneous) and inter-slice (time-lagged) causality between variables within the temporal chain, which is crucial for various scientific disciplines. Compared to causal discovery from non-time-series data, causal discovery from time-series data necessitates more serialized samples with a larger amount of observed time steps. To address the challenges, we propose a novel gradient-based causal discovery approach STIC, which focuses on \textbf{S}hort-\textbf{T}erm \textbf{I}nvariance using \textbf{C}onvolutional neural networks to uncover the causal relationships from time-series data. Specifically, STIC leverages both the short-term time and mechanism invariance of causality within each window observation, which possesses the property of independence, to enhance sample efficiency. Furthermore, we construct two causal convolution kernels, which correspond to the short-term time and mechanism invariance respectively, to estimate the window causal graph. To demonstrate the necessity of convolutional neural networks for causal discovery from time-series data, we theoretically derive the equivalence between convolution and the underlying generative principle of time-series data under the assumption that the additive noise model is identifiable. Experimental evaluations conducted on both synthetic and FMRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STIC outperforms baselines significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, particularly when the datasets contain a limited number of observed time steps.

        <tr id="Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting. Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various input formats and retrieval augmented generation(RAG) modules. From extensive experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast, incorporating raw texts in specific complex events and fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance. Moreover, enhanced with retrieval modules, LLM can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. Meanwhile, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem still persist in LLMs, particularly in the RAG-based method. These findings not only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also highlight several promising research directions.We consider that this comprehensive evaluation, along with the identified research opportunities, will significantly contribute to future research on temporal event forecasting through LLMs.">

        <tr id="Sequential recommendation systems aim to provide personalized recommendations by analyzing dynamic preferences and dependencies within user behavior sequences. Recently, Transformer models can effectively capture user preferences. However, their quadratic computational complexity limits recommendation performance on long interaction sequence data. Inspired by the State Space Model (SSM)representative model, Mamba, which efficiently captures user preferences in long interaction sequences with linear complexity, we find that Mamba's recommendation effectiveness is limited in short interaction sequences, with failing to recall items of actual interest to users and exacerbating the data sparsity cold start problem. To address this issue, we innovatively propose a new model, MaTrRec, which combines the strengths of Mamba and Transformer. This model fully leverages Mamba's advantages in handling long-term dependencies and Transformer's global attention advantages in short-term dependencies, thereby enhances predictive capabilities on both long and short interaction sequence datasets while balancing model efficiency. Notably, our model significantly improves the data sparsity cold start problem, with an improvement of up to 33% on the highly sparse Amazon Musical Instruments dataset. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on five widely used public datasets. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models on all five datasets.

We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks.

However, existing CTDG models encounter challenges stemming from noise and limited historical data. Graph Data Augmentation (GDA) emerges as a critical solution, yet current approaches primarily focus on static graphs and struggle to effectively address the dynamics inherent in CTDGs. Moreover, these methods often demand substantial domain expertise for parameter tuning and lack theoretical guarantees for augmentation efficacy. To address these issues, we propose Conda, a novel latent diffusion-based GDA method tailored for CTDGs. Conda features a sandwich-like architecture, incorporating a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and a conditional diffusion model, aimed at generating enhanced historical neighbor embeddings for target nodes. Unlike conventional diffusion models trained on entire graphs via pre-training, Conda requires historical neighbor sequence embeddings of target nodes for training, thus facilitating more targeted augmentation. We integrate Conda into the CTDG model and adopt an alternating training strategy to optimize performance. Extensive experimentation across six widely used real-world datasets showcases the consistent performance improvement of our approach, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data.">

        <tr id="Modern recurrent layers are emerging as a promising path toward edge deployment of foundation models, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs). Compressing the whole input sequence in a finite-dimensional representation enables recurrent layers to model long-range dependencies while maintaining a constant inference cost for each token and a fixed memory requirement. However, the practical deployment of LLMs in resource-limited environments often requires further model compression, such as quantization and pruning. While these techniques are well-established for attention-based models, their effects on recurrent layers remain underexplored. In this preliminary work, we focus on post-training quantization for recurrent LLMs and show that Mamba models exhibit the same pattern of outlier channels observed in attention-based LLMs. We show that the reason for the difficulty of quantizing SSMs is caused by activation outliers, similar to those observed in transformer-based LLMs. We report baseline results for post-training quantization of Mamba that do not take into account the activation outliers and suggest first steps for outlier-aware quantization.">

Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on massive datasets, encode vast quantities of world knowledge and can be used for the next job prediction problem. However, while an off-the-shelf LLM produces plausible career trajectories when prompted, the probability with which an LLM predicts a particular job transition conditional on career history will not, in general, align with the true conditional probability in a given population. Recently, Vafa et al. (2024) introduced a transformer-based"foundation model", CAREER, trained using a large, unrepresentative resume dataset, that predicts transitions between jobs; it further demonstrated how transfer learning techniques can be used to leverage the foundation model to build better predictive models of both transitions and wages that reflect conditional transition probabilities found in nationally representative survey datasets. This paper considers an alternative where the fine-tuning of the CAREER foundation model is replaced by fine-tuning LLMs. For the task of next job prediction, we demonstrate that models trained with our approach outperform several alternatives in terms of predictive performance on the survey data, including traditional econometric models, CAREER, and LLMs with in-context learning, even though the LLM can in principle predict job titles that are not allowed in the survey data. Further, we show that our fine-tuned LLM-based models' predictions are more representative of the career trajectories of various workforce subpopulations than off-the-shelf LLM models and CAREER.

        <tr id="Continual learning has emerged as a crucial paradigm for learning from sequential data while preserving previous knowledge. In the realm of continual graph learning, where graphs continuously evolve based on streaming graph data, continual graph learning presents unique challenges that require adaptive and efficient graph learning methods in addition to the problem of catastrophic forgetting. The first challenge arises from the interdependencies between different graph data, where previous graphs can influence new data distributions. The second challenge lies in the efficiency concern when dealing with large graphs. To addresses these two problems, we produce an Efficient Continual Graph Learner (E-CGL) in this paper. We tackle the interdependencies issue by demonstrating the effectiveness of replay strategies and introducing a combined sampling strategy that considers both node importance and diversity. To overcome the limitation of efficiency, E-CGL leverages a simple yet effective MLP model that shares weights with a GCN during training, achieving acceleration by circumventing the computationally expensive message passing process. Our method comprehensively surpasses nine baselines on four graph continual learning datasets under two settings, meanwhile E-CGL largely reduces the catastrophic forgetting problem down to an average of -1.1%. Additionally, E-CGL achieves an average of 15.83x training time acceleration and 4.89x inference time acceleration across the four datasets. These results indicate that E-CGL not only effectively manages the correlation between different graph data during continual training but also enhances the efficiency of continual learning on large graphs.

        <tr id="Time Series Classification (TSC) encompasses two settings: classifying entire sequences or classifying segmented subsequences. The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of Con4m in handling segmented TSC tasks on MVD.">

        <tr id="An emerging topic in large language models (LLMs) is their application to time series forecasting, characterizing mainstream and patternable characteristics of time series. A relevant but rarely explored and more challenging question is whether LLMs can detect and explain time series anomalies, a critical task across various real-world applications. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs, specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA3, in detecting and explaining anomalies in time series. Our studies reveal that: 1) LLMs cannot be directly used for time series anomaly detection. 2) By designing prompt strategies such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting, GPT-4 can detect time series anomalies with results competitive to baseline methods. 3) We propose a synthesized dataset to automatically generate time series anomalies with corresponding explanations. By applying instruction fine-tuning on this dataset, LLaMA3 demonstrates improved performance in time series anomaly detection tasks. In summary, our exploration shows the promising potential of LLMs as time series anomaly detectors.">

Traditional time-series models segment data into windows and assign one label per window, often missing label transitions within those windows. This paper presents a novel many-to-many time-series model and post-processing using hybrid recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms, which more effectively captures label transitions over traditional many-to-one models. Further, unlike typical other many-to-many models, our approach doesn’t require a decoder. Instead, it employs an RNN, generating a label for every input time step. During inference, a weighted voting scheme consolidates overlapping predictions into one label per time step. Experiments show our model remains effective on time-series with sparse label shifts, but particularly excels in detecting frequent transitions. This model is ideal for tasks demanding accurate pinpointing of rapid label changes in time-series data, such as gesture recognition, making it ideal for fast-paced human activity recognition. 1">

        <tr id="How to capture dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies remains an open question in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Although recent advanced spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) achieve superior forecasting performance, they either consider pre-defined spatial correlations or simply learn static graphs. Some research has tried to learn many adjacent matrices to reveal time-varying spatial correlations, but they generate discrete graphs which cannot encode evolutionary information and also face computational complexity problem. In this paper, we propose two significant plugins to help automatically learn enhanced dynamic spatial-temporal embedding of MTS data: (1) a novel neural conditional random field (CRF) layer. We find that the implicit time-varying spatial dependencies are reflected by the explicit changeable links between edges, and we propose the neural CRF to encode such pairwise changeable evolutionary inter-dependencies; (2) a structure adaptive graph convolution (SAGC) that does not require pre-defined graphs to capture semantically richer spatial correlations. Then, we integrate the neural CRF, SAGC with recurrent neural network to develop a new STGNN paradigm termed Adaptive Spatial-Temporal graph neural network with Conditional Random Field (ASTCRF), which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. We validate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of ASTCRF on five public benchmark MTS datasets.">

        <tr id="Stock price forecasting is a challenging area of research, particularly due to the complexity and unpredictability of financial markets. The accuracy of prediction models is influenced by various factors, including nonlinearity, seasonality, and economic shocks. Deep learning has demonstrated better forecasts of stock prices than traditional approaches. This study, therefore, proposed a new approach to improve forecasting system based on an end-to-end convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with attention mechanism. Our approach first investigates local stock price features using 1D convolutional neural network, and then employs a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network for forecasting. This model stands out by effectively utilizing contextual data and representing the temporal character of data. The Bi-LSTM is helpful for understanding the history and future contextual information since it uncovers both past and future contexts of stock data. Furthermore, integrating attention mechanism within the CRNN represents a significant improvement. This allows our model to handle long input sequences more effectively and capture the inherent stochasticity in stock prices, which is often missed by traditional models. The effectiveness of our approach is investigated using data on 10 stock indexes from Yahoo Finance. The results show that our method outperforms ARIMA, LSTM, and conventional methods. ">

        <tr id="Accurate traffic flow forecasting is a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems, playing a pivotal role in enhancing transportation intelligence. The integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers in traffic flow forecasting has gained significant adoption for enhancing prediction accuracy. Yet, the complex spatial and temporal dependencies present in traffic data continue to pose substantial challenges: (1) Most GNN-based methods assume that the graph structure reflects the actual dependencies between nodes, overlooking the complex dependencies present in the real-world context. (2) Standard time-series models are unable to effectively model complex temporal dependencies, hindering prediction accuracy. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a novel Transformer-based Spatiotemporal Graph Diffusion Convolution Network (TSGDC) for Traffic Flow Forecasting, which leverages graph diffusion and transformer to capture the complexity and dynamics of spatial and temporal patterns, thereby enhancing prediction performance. The authors designed an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) that learns separately from the feature dimensions collected by traffic sensors and the temporal dimensions of traffic data, aiding in spatiotemporal modeling. Chebyshev Graph Diffusion Convolution (GDC) is used to capture the complex dependencies within the spatial distribution. Sequence decomposition blocks, as internal operations of transformers, are employed to gradually extract long-term stable trends from hidden complex variables. Additionally, by integrating multi-scale dependencies, including recent, daily, and weekly patterns, accurate traffic flow predictions are achieved. Experimental results on various public datasets show that TSGDC outperforms conventional traffic forecasting models, particularly in accuracy and robustness.">

        <tr id="Many diverse phenomena in nature often inherently encode both short- and long-term temporal dependencies, which especially result from the direction of the flow of time. In this respect, we discovered experimental evidence suggesting that interrelations of these events are higher for closer time stamps. However, to be able for attention-based models to learn these regularities in short-term dependencies, it requires large amounts of data, which are often infeasible. This is because, while they are good at learning piece-wise temporal dependencies, attention-based models lack structures that encode biases in time series. As a resolution, we propose a simple and efficient method that enables attention layers to better encode the short-term temporal bias of these data sets by applying learnable, adaptive kernels directly to the attention matrices. We chose various prediction tasks for the experiments using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data sets since they are great examples with underlying long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Our experiments show exceptional classification results compared to best-performing models on most tasks and data sets.">

        <tr id="The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem exhibits different structural features in various domains. Neural network models can be used as more generalized algorithms that can be learned to solve specific problems based on different domain data than traditional rule-based approaches. How to accurately identify these structural features is crucial for neural networks to solve the SAT problem. Currently, learning-based SAT solvers, whether they are end-to-end models or enhancements to traditional heuristic algorithms, have achieved significant progress. In this article, we propose TG-SAT, an end-to-end framework based on Transformer and gated recurrent neural network (GRU) for predicting the satisfiability of SAT problems. TG-SAT can learn the structural features of SAT problems in a weakly supervised environment. To capture the structural information of the SAT problem, we encodes a SAT problem as an undirected graph and integrates GRU into the Transformer structure to update the node embeddings. By computing cross-attention scores between literals and clauses, a weighted representation of nodes is obtained. The model is eventually trained as a classifier to predict the satisfiability of the SAT problem. Experimental results demonstrate that TG-SAT achieves a 2%–5% improvement in accuracy on random 3-SAT problems compared to NeuroSAT. It also outperforms in SR(N), especially in handling more complex SAT problems, where our model achieves higher prediction accuracy.">

In response, regulatory measures like the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven the exploration of Machine Unlearning techniques, which aim to enable models to selectively forget certain data entries. While early approaches focused on pre-processing methods, recent research has shifted towards training-based machine unlearning methods. However, many existing methods require access to original training data, posing challenges in scenarios where such data is unavailable. Besides, directly facilitating unlearning may undermine the language model's general expressive ability. To this end, in this paper, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which addresses these challenges by incorporating three key components. We propose a Knowledge Unlearning Induction module for unlearning specific target sequences and a Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to prevent degrading in generation capacity. Additionally, an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module is integrated to make the process more adaptive to each target sample respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ICU in maintaining performance while efficiently unlearning sensitive information, offering a promising avenue for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.">

        <tr id="Temporal networks are effective in capturing the evolving interactions of networks over time, such as social networks and e-commerce networks. In recent years, researchers have primarily concentrated on developing specific model architectures for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) in order to improve the representation quality of temporal nodes and edges. However, limited attention has been given to the quality of negative samples during the training of TGNNs. When compared with static networks, temporal networks present two specific challenges for negative sampling: positive sparsity and positive shift. Positive sparsity refers to the presence of a single positive sample amidst numerous negative samples at each timestamp, while positive shift relates to the variations in positive samples across different timestamps. To robustly address these challenges in training TGNNs, we introduce Curriculum Negative Mining (CurNM), a model-aware curriculum learning framework that adaptively adjusts the difficulty of negative samples. Within this framework, we first establish a dynamically updated negative pool that balances random, historical, and hard negatives to address the challenges posed by positive sparsity. Secondly, we implement a temporal-aware negative selection module that focuses on learning from the disentangled factors of recently active edges, thus accurately capturing shifting preferences. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets and 3 TGNNs demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin. Additionally, thorough ablation studies and parameter sensitivity experiments verify the usefulness and robustness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/zziyue83/CurNM.">

The training process of NodeFlow employs standard gradient-based learning, facilitating the end-to-end optimization of the NODEs and CNF-based density estimation. This approach ensures outstanding performance, ease of implementation, and scalability, making NodeFlow an appealing choice for practitioners and researchers. Comprehensive assessments on benchmark datasets underscore NodeFlow’s efficacy, revealing its achievement of state-of-the-art outcomes in multivariate probabilistic regression setup and its strong performance in univariate regression tasks. Furthermore, ablation studies are conducted to justify the design choices of NodeFlow.

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing and learning representations from graph-structured data. A crucial prerequisite for the outstanding performance of GNNs is the availability of complete graph information, i.e., node features and graph structure, which is frequently unmet in real-world scenarios since graphs are often incomplete due to various uncontrollable factors. Existing approaches only focus on dealing with either incomplete features or incomplete structure, which leads to performance loss inevitably. To address this issue, this study proposes a mutual dual-stream graph neural network (MDS-GNN), which implements a mutual benefit learning between features and structure. Its main ideas are as follows: a) reconstructing the missing node features based on the initial incomplete graph structure; b) generating an augmented global graph based on the reconstructed node features, and propagating the incomplete node features on this global graph; and c) utilizing contrastive learning to make the dual-stream process mutually benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MDS-GNN on incomplete graphs.">

Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to existing approaches.">

        <tr id="Industrial Multivariate Time Series (MTS) is a critical view of the industrial field for people to understand the state of machines. However, due to data collection difficulty and privacy concerns, available data for building industrial intelligence and industrial large models is far from sufficient. Therefore, industrial time series data generation is of great importance. Existing research usually applies Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate MTS. However, GANs suffer from unstable training process due to the joint training of the generator and discriminator. This paper proposes a temporal-augmented conditional adaptive diffusion model, termed Diff-MTS, for MTS generation. It aims to better handle the complex temporal dependencies and dynamics of MTS data. Specifically, a conditional Adaptive Maximum-Mean Discrepancy (Ada-MMD) method has been proposed for the controlled generation of MTS, which does not require a classifier to control the generation. It improves the condition consistency of the diffusion model. Moreover, a Temporal Decomposition Reconstruction UNet (TDR-UNet) is established to capture complex temporal patterns and further improve the quality of the synthetic time series. Comprehensive experiments on the C-MAPSS and FEMTO datasets demonstrate that the proposed Diff-MTS performs substantially better in terms of diversity, fidelity, and utility compared with GAN-based methods. These results show that Diff-MTS facilitates the generation of industrial data, contributing to intelligent maintenance and the construction of industrial large models.">

While there has been substantial progress in flexible neural network-based post-processing methods over the past years, most station-based approaches still treat every input data point separately which limits the capabilities for leveraging spatial structures in the forecast errors. In order to improve information sharing across locations, we propose a graph neural network architecture for ensemble post-processing, which represents the station locations as nodes on a graph and utilizes an attention mechanism to identify relevant predictive information from neighboring locations. In a case study on 2-m temperature forecasts over Europe, the graph neural network model shows substantial improvements over a highly competitive neural network-based post-processing method.">

Furthermore, we systematically analyze the critical technologies required to construct industrial LGMs from four aspects: large-scale industrial dataset, LGMs architecture for complex industrial characteristics, self-supervised training for industrial time series, and fine-tuning of industrial downstream tasks.

        <tr id="Decoder-only transformers are the backbone of the popular generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series of large language models. In this work, we employ this framework to the analysis of clinical heart time-series data, to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, termed PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We place a special emphasis on making both such pre-trained models fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that, in order to make predictions, the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, we show that tokens with the same value, which occur at different distinct points in the electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space. The clusters form according to phase, as the tokens propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models are straightforward to fine-tune for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation (AF), and beat detection in photoplethysmography. For the example of AF, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved the respective leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG within the MIMIC Perform AF dataset. In addition, the fine-tuned beat detector achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score of 98%, as well as uniquely providing a beat confidence level which acts as a signal quality estimator. Importantly, the fine-tuned models for AF screening are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based methods have recently demonstrated their potential in time series forecasting problems. However, the mainstream approach, primarily utilizing attention to model inter-step correlation in the time domain, is constrained by two significant issues that lead to ineffective and inefficient multivariate forecasting. The first is that key representations in the time domain are scattered and sparse, resulting in parameter bloat and increased difficulty in capturing time dependencies. The second is that treating time step points as uniformly embedded tokens leads to the erasure of inter-variate correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a frequency-wise and variables-oriented transformer-based method. This method leverages the intrinsic conjugate symmetry in the frequency domain, enabling compact frequency domain representations that naturally mix information across time points while reducing spatio-temporal costs. Multivariate inter-correlations can also be captured from similar frequency domain components, which enhances the variables-oriented attention mechanism modeling capability. Further, we employ both polar and complex domain perspectives to enrich the frequency domain representations and decode complicated temporal patterns. We propose frequency-enhanced independent representation multi-head attention (FIR-Attention) to leverage these advantages for improved multivariate interaction. Techniques such as cutting-off frequency and equivalent mapping are used to ensure the model’s lightweight nature. Extensive experiments on eight mainstream datasets show that our approach achieves first-rate satisfactory results and, importantly, requires only one percent of the spatio-temporal cost of mainstream methods.">

        <tr id="Self-supervised contrastive learning has become a key technique in deep learning, particularly in time series analysis, due to its ability to learn meaningful representations without explicit supervision. Augmentation is a critical component in contrastive learning, where different augmentations can dramatically impact performance, sometimes influencing accuracy by over 30%. However, the selection of augmentations is predominantly empirical which can be suboptimal, or grid searching that is time-consuming. In this paper, we establish a principled framework for selecting augmentations based on dataset characteristics such as trend and seasonality. Specifically, we construct 12 synthetic datasets incorporating trend, seasonality, and integration weights. We then evaluate the effectiveness of 8 different augmentations across these synthetic datasets, thereby inducing generalizable associations between time series characteristics and augmentation efficiency. Additionally, we evaluated the induced associations across 6 real-world datasets encompassing domains such as activity recognition, disease diagnosis, traffic monitoring, electricity usage, mechanical fault prognosis, and finance. These real-world datasets are diverse, covering a range from 1 to 12 channels, 2 to 10 classes, sequence lengths of 14 to 1280, and data frequencies from 250 Hz to daily intervals. The experimental results show that our proposed trend-seasonality-based augmentation recommendation algorithm can accurately identify the effective augmentations for a given time series dataset, achieving an average Recall@3 of 0.667, outperforming baselines. Our work provides guidance for studies employing contrastive learning in time series analysis, with wide-ranging applications. All the code, datasets, and analysis results will be released at https://github.com/DL4mHealth/TS-Contrastive-Augmentation-Recommendation.">

        <tr id="Current language models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in text generation. However, for many applications it is desirable to control attributes, such as sentiment, or toxicity, of the generated language -- ideally tailored towards each specific use case and target audience. For auto-regressive language models, existing guidance methods are prone to decoding errors that cascade during generation and degrade performance. In contrast, text diffusion models can easily be guided with, for example, a simple linear sentiment classifier -- however they do suffer from significantly higher perplexity than auto-regressive alternatives. In this paper we use a guided diffusion model to produce a latent proposal that steers an auto-regressive language model to generate text with desired properties. Our model inherits the unmatched fluency of the auto-regressive approach and the plug-and-play flexibility of diffusion. We show that it outperforms previous plug-and-play guidance methods across a wide range of benchmark data sets. Further, controlling a new attribute in our framework is reduced to training a single logistic regression classifier.">

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) are prominent in predictive analytics for accurately forecasting target variables. However, inherent uncertainties necessitate constructing prediction intervals for reliability. The existing literature often lacks practical methodologies for creating predictive intervals, especially for time series with trends and seasonal patterns. This paper explicitly details a practical approach integrating dual-output Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDO) with DNNs to approximate predictive means and variances within a Bayesian framework, enabling forecast interval construction. The dual-output architecture employs a custom loss function, combining mean squared error with Softplus-derived predictive variance, ensuring non-negative variance values. Hyperparameter optimization is performed through a grid search exploring activation functions, dropout rates, epochs, and batch sizes. Empirical distributions of predictive means and variances from the MCDO demonstrate the results of the dual-output MCDO DNNs. The proposed method achieves a significant improvement in forecast accuracy, with an RMSE reduction of about 10% compared to the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model. Additionally, the method provides more reliable forecast intervals, as evidenced by a higher coverage proportion and narrower interval widths. A case study on Thailand’s durian export data showcases the method’s utility and applicability to other datasets with trends and/or seasonal components.">

Nevertheless, current multi-intent SLU approaches still heavily rely on large amounts of annotated multi-intent SLU data, which makes it hard to be satisfied in real-world scenarios without sufficient data. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel decoupled pre-training framework (DPF) to address the data-scarcity problem, achieving to leverage of abundant multi-intent-free SLU data to enhance multi-intent SLU. Specifically, DPF first decouples the multi-intent SLU task into two abilities: (1) task-agnostic ability to locate the task-agnostic slot entity span and (2) task-specific ability to predict the task-specific slot and intent labels simultaneously. The key insight of DPF is that such decomposition allows us to design a two-stage decoupled pre-training procedure to enhance both task-agnostic ability and task-specific ability with abundant multi-intent-free SLU data (i.e., NER and single-intent SLU data), respectively. Experimental results on two standard benchmarks (e.g., MixATIS and MixSNIPS) demonstrate the effectiveness of DPF by achieving superior performance. In addition, extensive analyses reveal that utilizing the multi-intent-free data can effectively enhance multi-intent SLU.">

        <tr id="The rapid growth of location-based services (LBS) has yielded massive amounts of data on human mobility. Effectively extracting meaningful representations for user-generated check-in sequences is pivotal for facilitating various downstream services. However, the user-generated check-in data are simultaneously influenced by the surrounding objective circumstances and the user's subjective intention. Specifically, the temporal uncertainty and spatial diversity exhibited in check-in data make it difficult to capture the macroscopic spatial-temporal patterns of users and to understand the semantics of user mobility activities. Furthermore, the distinct characteristics of the temporal and spatial information in check-in sequences call for an effective fusion method to incorporate these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Cross-view Contrastive Representation (STCCR) framework for check-in sequence representation learning. Specifically, STCCR addresses the above challenges by employing self-supervision from"spatial topic"and"temporal intention"views, facilitating effective fusion of spatial and temporal information at the semantic level. Besides, STCCR leverages contrastive clustering to uncover users' shared spatial topics from diverse mobility activities, while employing angular momentum contrast to mitigate the impact of temporal uncertainty and noise. We extensively evaluate STCCR on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance across three downstream tasks.">

The study aims to compare the predictive performance of these two deep learning architectures within the context of financial forecasting. Utilizing historical stock data from the CAC40 dataset, which represents a capitalization-weighted measure of the 40 most significant stocks on the Euronext Paris, we train and evaluate RNN and LSTM models to forecast future stock prices. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of LSTM networks in capturing the intricate temporal dependencies inherent in stock price data. Compared to standard RNNs, LSTM models exhibit higher accuracy and provide more reliable forecasts over the 10-day prediction period. The specialized memory cells and gating mechanisms in LSTM networks enable them to effectively identify both short-term changes and long-term patterns in stock prices, thus outperforming traditional RNN architectures. This enhanced ability to model the complex dynamics of stock market data underscores the potential of LSTM networks to improve investment decision-making, risk management, and the overall efficiency of financial markets. The insights gained from this study contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the application of deep learning in finance and investment, offering valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers seeking to harness the power of advanced algorithms for stock market prediction and optimization.">

        <tr id="We introduce the Robustness of Hierarchically Organized Time Series (RHiOTS) framework, designed to assess the robustness of hierarchical time series forecasting models and algorithms on real-world datasets. Hierarchical time series, where lower-level forecasts must sum to upper-level ones, are prevalent in various contexts, such as retail sales across countries. Current empirical evaluations of forecasting methods are often limited to a small set of benchmark datasets, offering a narrow view of algorithm behavior. RHiOTS addresses this gap by systematically altering existing datasets and modifying the characteristics of individual series and their interrelations. It uses a set of parameterizable transformations to simulate those changes in the data distribution. Additionally, RHiOTS incorporates an innovative visualization component, turning complex, multidimensional robustness evaluation results into intuitive, easily interpretable visuals. This approach allows an in-depth analysis of algorithm and model behavior under diverse conditions. We illustrate the use of RHiOTS by analyzing the predictive performance of several algorithms. Our findings show that traditional statistical methods are more robust than state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, except when the transformation effect is highly disruptive. Furthermore, we found no significant differences in the robustness of the algorithms when applying specific reconciliation methods, such as MinT. RHiOTS provides researchers with a comprehensive tool for understanding the nuanced behavior of forecasting algorithms, offering a more reliable basis for selecting the most appropriate method for a given problem.">

Moreover, the decoder recurrence allows generation to be resumed without reprocessing the whole sequence. Finally, we propose the autoregressive VSSM that can be conditioned on a partial realization of the sequence, as is common in language generation tasks. Interestingly, the autoregressive VSSM still enables parallel generation. We highlight on toy problems (MNIST, CIFAR) the empirical gains in speed-up and show that it competes with traditional models in terms of generation quality (Transformer, Mamba SSM).">

The majority of time series forecasting models are trained using the mean squared error (MSE). However, this training based on MSE causes a limitation known as prediction delay. The prediction delay, which implies the ground-truth precedes the prediction, can cause serious problems in a variety of fields, e.g., finance and weather forecasting -- as a matter of fact, predictions succeeding ground-truth observations are not practically meaningful although their MSEs can be low. This paper proposes a new perspective on traditional time series forecasting tasks and introduces a new solution to mitigate the prediction delay. We introduce a continuous-time gated recurrent unit (GRU) based on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) which can supervise explicit time-derivatives. We generalize the GRU architecture in a continuous-time manner and minimize the prediction delay through our time-derivative regularization. Our method outperforms in metrics such as MSE, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Time Distortion Index (TDI). In addition, we demonstrate the low prediction delay of our method in a variety of datasets.">

        <tr id="This paper investigates the one-epoch overfitting phenomenon in Click-Through Rate (CTR) models, where performance notably declines at the start of the second epoch. Despite extensive research, the efficacy of multi-epoch training over the conventional one-epoch approach remains unclear. We identify the overfitting of the embedding layer, caused by high-dimensional data sparsity, as the primary issue. To address this, we introduce a novel and simple Multi-Epoch learning with Data Augmentation (MEDA) framework, suitable for both non-continual and continual learning scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing deep CTR models and may have potential applications to handle the"forgetting or overfitting"dilemma in the retraining and the well-known catastrophic forgetting problems. MEDA minimizes overfitting by reducing the dependency of the embedding layer on subsequent training data or the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers, and achieves data augmentation through training the MLP with varied embedding spaces. Our findings confirm that pre-trained MLP layers can adapt to new embedding spaces, enhancing performance without overfitting. This adaptability underscores the MLP layers' role in learning a matching function focused on the relative relationships among embeddings rather than their absolute positions. To our knowledge, MEDA represents the first multi-epoch training strategy tailored for deep CTR prediction models. We conduct extensive experiments on several public and business datasets, and the effectiveness of data augmentation and superiority over conventional single-epoch training are fully demonstrated. Besides, MEDA has exhibited significant benefits in a real-world online advertising system.">

In this paper, we analyze such a phenomenon from the perspective of waiver phenomenon, which involves reducing the internal values of certain elements in the sequence, allowing them to absorb excess attention without affecting their contribution to information.

        <tr id="Scaling up deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods presents a significant challenge. Following developments in generative modelling, model-based RL positions itself as a strong contender. Recent advances in sequence modelling have led to effective transformer-based world models, albeit at the price of heavy computations due to the long sequences of tokens required to accurately simulate environments. In this work, we propose $\Delta$-IRIS, a new agent with a world model architecture composed of a discrete autoencoder that encodes stochastic deltas between time steps and an autoregressive transformer that predicts future deltas by summarizing the current state of the world with continuous tokens. In the Crafter benchmark, $\Delta$-IRIS sets a new state of the art at multiple frame budgets, while being an order of magnitude faster to train than previous attention-based approaches. We release our code and models at https://github.com/vmicheli/delta-iris.">

        <tr id="Distribution shift over time occurs in many settings. Leveraging historical data is necessary to learn a model for the last time point when limited data is available in the final period, yet few methods have been developed specifically for this purpose. In this work, we construct a benchmark with different sequences of synthetic shifts to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 classes of methods that 1) learn from all data without adapting to the final period, 2) learn from historical data with no regard to the sequential nature and then adapt to the final period, and 3) leverage the sequential nature of historical data when tailoring a model to the final period. We call this benchmark Seq-to-Final to highlight the focus on using a sequence of time periods to learn a model for the final time point. Our synthetic benchmark allows users to construct sequences with different types of shift and compare different methods. We focus on image classification tasks using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as the base images for the synthetic sequences. We also evaluate the same methods on the Portraits dataset to explore the relevance to real-world shifts over time. Finally, we create a visualization to contrast the initializations and updates from different methods at the final time step. Our results suggest that, for the sequences in our benchmark, methods that disregard the sequential structure and adapt to the final time point tend to perform well. The approaches we evaluate that leverage the sequential nature do not offer any improvement. We hope that this benchmark will inspire the development of new algorithms that are better at leveraging sequential historical data or a deeper understanding of why methods that disregard the sequential nature are able to perform well.">

Deep neural networks, however, have often struggled with these for a variety of reasons. Recent advances, both in system engineering as well as model design, have enabled the scaling up of model that are purported to support extended context length. In particular, the state-space and linear recurrent neural network families of models hypothetically can entend to infinite sequence lenth. However, is this too good to be true? We conduct an evaluation to show that while such claims may be sound theoretically, there remain large practical gaps that are empirically observed. In particular, recurrent models still suffer in the same settings as long-context LLMs with attention. We further show that different inductive biases have inconsistent extrapolation capabilities, highlighting the need to further study such paradigms and investigate why long-context models seemingly fail to behave as one might expect.">

We also explore the existence of an implicit inductive bias (e.g. fully connected networks prefer to learn low frequency functions in their input space) in GNNs, in the context of graph classification tasks. We further prove theoretically that the message-passing layers in the graph, have a tendency to search for either discriminative subgraphs, or a collection of discriminative nodes dispersed across the graph, depending on the different global pooling layers used. We empirically verify this bias through experiments over real-world and synthetic datasets.

An efficient method of forecasting floods is crucial to limit this damage. Techniques for flood prediction are currently based on hydrological, and hydrodynamic (physically-based) numerical models. Machine learning methods that include deep learning offer certain advantages over conventional physically based approaches, including flexibility and accuracy. Deep learning methods have been promising for predicting small to medium-sized climate extreme events over a short time horizon; however, large flooding events present a critical challenge. We present an ensemble-based machine learning approach that addresses large-scale extreme flooding challenges using a switching mechanism motivated by extreme-value theory for long-short-term-memory (LSTM) deep learning models. We use a multivariate and multi-step time-series prediction approach to predict streamflow for multiple days ahead in the major catchments of Australia. The ensemble framework also employs static information to enrich the time-series information, allowing for regional modelling across catchments. Our results demonstrate enhanced prediction of streamflow extremes, with notable efficacy for large flooding scenarios in the selected Australian catchments. Through comparative analysis, our methodology underscores the potential for deep learning models to revolutionise flood forecasting across diverse regions.">

A common STLF approach involves making predictions based on multiple input variables which affect the load. However, additional data besides historical load data often are not available, making STLF a challenging univariate task. Two approaches are discussed in this paper for the univariate day-ahead STLF: the first integrates temporal information into the input regression vector, with Seasonal Auto-Regressive Moving Average (SARMA) and Prophet being the best representatives for the application considered; the second integrates temporal information directly into its architecture through the feedback of the internal state, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) chosen for this purpose. The models were evaluated on a real case study involving a university building in Italy. The results validate the effectiveness of the LSTM model. LSTM performed significantly better than SARIMA, and slightly better than RNN and Prophet, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) equal to 13.12 kW, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) equal to 25.09 kW, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) equal to 10.97% and an R2 score equal to 0.85. This work provides a foundation for the improvement and deployment of such time series forecasting techniques in the emerging field of STLF for energy management.">

Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) demonstrate good performance on many Temporal-correlation Forecasting Problem. However, when applied to tasks lacking periodicity, such as stock data prediction, the effectiveness and robustness of STGNNs are found to be unsatisfactory. And STGNNs are limited by memory savings so that cannot handle problems with a large number of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network (TCGPN) to address these limitations. TCGPN utilize Temporal-correlation fusion encoder to get a mixed representation and pre-training method with carefully designed temporal and correlation pre-training tasks. Entire structure is independent of the number and order of nodes, so better results can be obtained through various data enhancements. And memory consumption during training can be significantly reduced through multiple sampling. Experiments are conducted on real stock market data sets CSI300 and CSI500 that exhibit minimal periodicity. We fine-tune a simple MLP in downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results, validating the capability to capture more robust temporal correlation patterns.">

 Traffic forecasting problems involve jointly modeling the non-linear spatio-temporal dependencies at different scales. While Graph Neural Network models have been effectively used to capture the non-linear spatial dependencies, capturing the dynamic spatial dependencies between the locations remains a major challenge. The errors in capturing such dependencies propagate in modeling the temporal dependencies between the locations, thereby severely affecting the performance of long-term predictions. While transformer-based mechanisms have been recently proposed for capturing the dynamic spatial dependencies, these methods are susceptible to fluctuations in data brought on by unforeseen events like traffic congestion and accidents. To mitigate these issues we propose an improvised Spatio-temporal parallel transformer (STPT) based model for traffic prediction that uses multiple adjacency graphs passed through a pair of coupled graph transformer-convolution network units, operating in parallel, to generate more noise-resilient embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 real-world traffic datasets and compare the performance of STPT with several state-of-the-art baselines, in terms of measures like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. We find that using STPT improves the performance by around

 \(10-34\%\)

 as compared to the baselines. We also investigate the applicability of the model on other spatio-temporal data in other domains. We use a covid-19 dataset to predict the number of future occurrences in different regions from a given set of historical occurrences. The results demonstrate the superiority of our model for such datasets.

This paper proposes a Cross-Dimensional Attention Discriminating Masked (CDADM) method, which modifies the self-attention model. The CDADM method captures essential global information about missing values through the cross-dimensional attention mechanism. Meanwhile, the discriminating attention mask mechanism enhances the ability to extract dependencies in long sequence data.

This study compares the performance of three forecasting models: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Prophet within the context of specific sales categories derived from acquiring data provided by a bank. This study uses a time series dataset provided by Tink off data, which covers various sales categories and time intervals. These categories, including pharmacies, railway tickets, books, sporting goods and fuel stations, present unique forecasting challenges because of their distinct demand patterns and potential for high volatility. Through a comparative analysis focusing on accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency, the study reveals that while all models demonstrate efficacy in certain scenarios, their performance varies depending on the specific category and forecasting horizon. ARIMA exhibits consistent accuracy across categories, particularly for daily predictions, aligning with its strength in capturing trends and seasonality. LSTM, on the other hand, shows promise for hourly predictions in categories like fuel stations, leveraging its ability to learn long-term dependencies. However, the LSTM model shows inconsistent results, sometimes outperforming others, but with varying performance across runs. This study provides insights for practitioners within the banking and financial sectors seeking to select the most appropriate forecasting model based on their specific sales categories and forecasting needs.">

We evaluate the capabilities of TDMs for continuous control in real-time planning scenarios with Model Predictive Control (MPC). While Transformers excel in long-horizon prediction, their tokenization mechanism and autoregressive nature lead to costly planning over long horizons, especially as the environment's dimensionality increases. To alleviate this issue, we use a TDM for short-term planning, and learn an autoregressive discrete Q-function using a separate Q-Transformer (QT) model to estimate a long-term return beyond the short-horizon planning. Our proposed method, QT-TDM, integrates the robust predictive capabilities of Transformers as dynamics models with the efficacy of a model-free Q-Transformer to mitigate the computational burden associated with real-time planning. Experiments in diverse state-based continuous control tasks show that QT-TDM is superior in performance and sample efficiency compared to existing Transformer-based RL models while achieving fast and computationally efficient inference.">

To tackle this gap, we propose a global dependency graph network (GDGN) soft sensor, informed by both prior knowledge and process data. Initially, it estimates the Bernoulli distribution to gauge the probability of dependency among variables, followed by a random sampling to form the dependency graph. Importantly, the integration of even partially available prior knowledge can bolster the physical accuracy of this graph. Subsequently, GDGN applies a self-attention mechanism (SAM) to craft the global dependency within set constraints, utilizing graph convolution for quality variable prediction. Ultimately, it elucidates the modeling and prediction process. The efficacy and physical coherence of the GDGN’s prediction logic were validated through two distinct case studies.">

        <tr id="In recent years, continual learning with pre-training (CLPT) has received widespread interest, instead of its traditional focus of training from scratch. The use of strong pre-trained models (PTMs) can greatly facilitate knowledge transfer and alleviate catastrophic forgetting, but also suffers from progressive overfitting of pre-trained knowledge into specific downstream tasks. A majority of current efforts often keep the PTMs frozen and incorporate task-specific prompts to instruct representation learning, coupled with a prompt selection process for inference. However, due to the limited capacity of prompt parameters, this strategy demonstrates only sub-optimal performance in continual learning. In comparison, tuning all parameters of PTMs often provides the greatest potential for representation learning, making sequential fine-tuning (Seq FT) a fundamental baseline that has been overlooked in CLPT. To this end, we present an in-depth analysis of the progressive overfitting problem from the lens of Seq FT. Considering that the overly fast representation learning and the biased classification layer constitute this particular problem, we introduce the advanced Slow Learner with Classifier Alignment (SLCA++) framework to unleash the power of Seq FT, serving as a strong baseline approach for CLPT. Our approach involves a Slow Learner to selectively reduce the learning rate of backbone parameters, and a Classifier Alignment to align the disjoint classification layers in a post-hoc fashion. We further enhance the efficacy of SL with a symmetric cross-entropy loss, as well as employ a parameter-efficient strategy to implement Seq FT with SLCA++.

        <tr id="Despite the massive attention given to time-series explanations due to their extensive applications, a notable limitation in existing approaches is their primary reliance on the time-domain. This overlooks the inherent characteristic of time-series data containing both time and frequency features. In this work, we present Spectral eXplanation (SpectralX), an XAI framework that provides time-frequency explanations for time-series black-box classifiers. This easily adaptable framework enables users to"plug-in"various perturbation-based XAI methods for any pre-trained time-series classification models to assess their impact on the explanation quality without having to modify the framework architecture. Additionally, we introduce Feature Importance Approximations (FIA), a new perturbation-based XAI method. These methods consist of feature insertion, deletion, and combination techniques to enhance computational efficiency and class-specific explanations in time-series classification tasks. We conduct extensive experiments in the generated synthetic dataset and various UCR Time-Series datasets to first compare the explanation performance of FIA and other existing perturbation-based XAI methods in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, and then show the superiority of our FIA in the time-frequency domain with the SpectralX framework. Finally, we conduct a user study to confirm the practicality of our FIA in SpectralX framework for class-specific time-frequency based time-series explanations.

        <tr id="We present a knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) framework for modeling multi-scale processes, and study its performance in the context of streamflow forecasting in hydrology. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical recurrent neural architecture that factorizes the system dynamics at multiple temporal scales and captures their interactions. This framework consists of an inverse and a forward model. The inverse model is used to empirically resolve the system's temporal modes from data (physical model simulations, observed data, or a combination of them from the past), and these states are then used in the forward model to predict streamflow. In a hydrological system, these modes can represent different processes, evolving at different temporal scales (e.g., slow: groundwater recharge and baseflow vs. fast: surface runoff due to extreme rainfall). A key advantage of our framework is that once trained, it can incorporate new observations into the model's context (internal state) without expensive optimization approaches (e.g., EnKF) that are traditionally used in physical sciences for data assimilation. Experiments with several river catchments from the NWS NCRFC region show the efficacy of this ML-based data assimilation framework compared to standard baselines, especially for basins that have a long history of observations. Even for basins that have a shorter observation history, we present two orthogonal strategies of training our FHNN framework: (a) using simulation data from imperfect simulations and (b) using observation data from multiple basins to build a global model. We show that both of these strategies (that can be used individually or together) are highly effective in mitigating the lack of training data. The improvement in forecast accuracy is particularly noteworthy for basins where local models perform poorly because of data sparsity.">

        <tr id="Heterophilic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results for semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs. Notably, most real-world heterophilic graphs are composed of a mixture of nodes with different neighbor patterns, exhibiting local node-level homophilic and heterophilic structures. However, existing works are only devoted to designing better HGNN backbones or architectures for node classification tasks on heterophilic and homophilic graph benchmarks simultaneously, and their analyses of HGNN performance with respect to nodes are only based on the determined data distribution without exploring the effect caused by this structural difference between training and testing nodes. How to learn invariant node representations on heterophilic graphs to handle this structure difference or distribution shifts remains unexplored. In this paper, we first discuss the limitations of previous graph-based invariant learning methods from the perspective of data augmentation. Then, we propose \textbf{HEI}, a framework capable of generating invariant node representations through incorporating heterophily information to infer latent environments without augmentation, which are then used for invariant prediction, under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. We theoretically show that our proposed method can achieve guaranteed performance under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and backbones can also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the-art baselines.">

        <tr id="Multivariate time series modeling has been essential in sensor-based data mining tasks. However, capturing complex dynamics caused by intra-variable (temporal) and inter-variable (spatial) relationships while simultaneously taking into account evolving data distributions is a non-trivial task, which faces accumulated computational overhead and multiple temporal patterns or distribution modes. Most existing methods focus on the former direction without adaptive task-specific learning ability. To this end, we developed a holistic spatial-temporal meta-learning probabilistic inference framework, entitled ST-MeLaPI, for the efficient and versatile learning of complex dynamics. Specifically, first, a multivariate relationship recognition module is utilized to learn task-specific inter-variable dependencies. Then, a multiview meta-learning and probabilistic inference strategy was designed to learn shared parameters while enabling the fast and flexible learning of task-specific parameters for different batches. At the core are spatial dependency-oriented and temporal pattern-oriented meta-learning approximate probabilistic inference modules, which can quickly adapt to changing environments via stochastic neurons at each timestamp. Finally, a gated aggregation scheme is leveraged to realize appropriate information selection for the generative style prediction. We benchmarked our approach against state-of-the-art methods with real-world data. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the baselines.">

        <tr id="Summarizing web graphs is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the modeled information and its changes over time. We investigate the use of neural networks for lifelong graph summarization. Assuming we observe the web graph at a certain time, we train the networks to summarize graph vertices. We apply this trained network to summarize the vertices of the changed graph at the next point in time. Subsequently, we continue training and evaluating the network to perform lifelong graph summarization. We use the GNNs Graph-MLP and GraphSAINT, as well as an MLP baseline, to summarize the temporal graphs. We compare $1$-hop and $2$-hop summaries. We investigate the impact of reusing parameters from a previous snapshot by measuring the backward and forward transfer and the forgetting rate of the neural networks. Our extensive experiments on ten weekly snapshots of a web graph with over $100$M edges, sampled in 2012 and 2022, show that all networks predominantly use $1$-hop information to determine the summary, even when performing $2$-hop summarization. Due to the heterogeneity of web graphs, in some snapshots, the $2$-hop summary produces over ten times more vertex summaries than the $1$-hop summary. When using the network trained on the last snapshot from 2012 and applying it to the first snapshot of 2022, we observe a strong drop in accuracy. We attribute this drop over the ten-year time warp to the strongly increased heterogeneity of the web graph in 2022.">

        <tr id="Dynamic graphs (DG) are often used to describe evolving interactions between nodes in real-world applications. Temporal patterns are a natural feature of DGs and are also key to representation learning. However, existing dynamic GCN models are mostly composed of static GCNs and sequence modules, which results in the separation of spatiotemporal information and cannot effectively capture complex temporal patterns in DGs. To address this problem, this study proposes a spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks with diversified transformation (STGCNDT), which includes three aspects: a) constructing a unified graph tensor convolutional network (GTCN) using tensor M-products without the need to represent spatiotemporal information separately; b) introducing three transformation schemes in GTCN to model complex temporal patterns to aggregate temporal information; and c) constructing an ensemble of diversified transformation schemes to obtain higher representation capabilities. Empirical studies on four DGs that appear in communication networks show that the proposed STGCNDT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in solving link weight estimation tasks due to the diversified transformations.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.">

The approach to frequently retraining graph models is resource intensive and impractical. To address this pressing challenge, this paper introduces a new concept of graph memory learning. Its core idea is to enable a graph model to selectively remember new knowledge but forget old knowledge. Building on this approach, the paper presents a novel graph memory learning framework - Brain-inspired Graph Memory Learning (BGML), inspired by brain network dynamics and function-structure coupling strategies. BGML incorporates a multi-granular hierarchical progressive learning mechanism rooted in feature graph grain learning to mitigate potential conflict between memorization and forgetting in graph memory learning. This mechanism allows for a comprehensive and multi-level perception of local details within evolving graphs. In addition, to tackle the issue of unreliable structures in newly added incremental information, the paper introduces an information self-assessment ownership mechanism. This mechanism not only facilitates the propagation of incremental information within the model but also effectively preserves the integrity of past experiences. We design five types of graph memory learning tasks: regular, memory, unlearning, data-incremental, and class-incremental to evaluate BGML. Its excellent performance is confirmed through extensive experiments on multiple real-world node classification datasets.">

Approaches based on Latent Feature Analysis (LFA) have shown to be beneficial for discovering effective temporal patterns in QoS data.

To address the problem, this paper presents a novel Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-based dynamic QoS estimator namely Spatiotemporal Coupling GCN (SCG) model with the three-fold ideas as below. First, SCG builds its dynamic graph convolution rules by incorporating generalized tensor product framework, for unified modeling of spatial and temporal patterns. Second, SCG combines the heterogeneous GCN layer with tensor factorization, for effective representation learning on bipartite user-service graphs. Third, it further simplifies the dynamic GCN structure to lower the training difficulties. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two large-scale widely-adopted QoS datasets describing throughput and response time. The results demonstrate that SCG realizes higher QoS estimation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-arts, illustrating it can learn powerful representations to users and cloud services.">

        <tr id="Graph out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a major challenge in graph learning since graph neural networks (GNNs) often suffer from severe performance degradation under distribution shifts. Invariant learning, aiming to extract invariant features across varied distributions, has recently emerged as a promising approach for OOD generation. Despite the great success of invariant learning in OOD problems for Euclidean data (i.e., images), the exploration within graph data remains constrained by the complex nature of graphs. Existing studies, such as data augmentation or causal intervention, either suffer from disruptions to invariance during the graph manipulation process or face reliability issues due to a lack of supervised signals for causal parts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called Invariant Graph Learning based on Information bottleneck theory (InfoIGL), to extract the invariant features of graphs and enhance models' generalization ability to unseen distributions. Specifically, InfoIGL introduces a redundancy filter to compress task-irrelevant information related to environmental factors. Cooperating with our designed multi-level contrastive learning, we maximize the mutual information among graphs of the same class in the downstream classification tasks, preserving invariant features for prediction to a great extent. An appealing feature of InfoIGL is its strong generalization ability without depending on supervised signal of invariance. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under OOD generalization for graph classification tasks.

        <tr id="Industrial time-series, as a structural data responds to production process information, can be utilized to perform data-driven decision-making for effective monitoring of industrial production process. However, there are some challenges for time-series forecasting in industry, e.g., predicting few-shot caused by data shortage, and decision-confusing caused by unknown treatment policy. To cope with the problems, we propose a novel causal domain adaptation framework, Causal Domain Adaptation (CDA) forecaster to improve the performance on the interested domain with limited data (target). Firstly, we analyze the causality existing along with treatments, and thus ensure the shared causality over time. Subsequently, we propose an answer-based attention mechanism to achieve domain-invariant representation by the shared causality in both domains. Then, a novel domain-adaptation is built to model treatments and outcomes jointly training on source and target domain. The main insights are that our designed answer-based attention mechanism allows the target domain to leverage the existed causality in source time-series even with different treatments, and our forecaster can predict the counterfactual outcome of industrial time-series, meaning a guidance in production process. Compared with commonly baselines, our method on real-world and synthetic oilfield datasets demonstrates the effectiveness in across-domain prediction and the practicality in guiding production process">

        <tr id="This paper presents Diffusion Forcing, a new training paradigm where a diffusion model is trained to denoise a set of tokens with independent per-token noise levels. We apply Diffusion Forcing to sequence generative modeling by training a causal next-token prediction model to generate one or several future tokens without fully diffusing past ones. Our approach is shown to combine the strengths of next-token prediction models, such as variable-length generation, with the strengths of full-sequence diffusion models, such as the ability to guide sampling to desirable trajectories. Our method offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out sequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training horizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that uniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing's variable-horizon and causal architecture, and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and planning tasks. In addition to its empirical success, our method is proven to optimize a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of tokens drawn from the true joint distribution.

        <tr id="Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a crucial data mining technique with a wide range of applications in areas such as IT applications. Currently, the majority of anomaly detection methods for time series data rely on unsupervised approaches due to the rarity of anomaly labels. However, in real-world scenarios, obtaining a limited number of anomaly labels is feasible and affordable. Effective usage of these labels can offer valuable insights into the temporal characteristics of anomalies and play a pivotal role in guiding anomaly detection efforts. To improve the performance of multivariate time series anomaly detection, we proposed a novel deep learning model named EDD (Encoder-Decoder-Discriminator) that leverages limited anomaly samples. The EDD model innovatively integrates a graph attention network with long short term memory (LSTM) to extract spatial and temporal features from multivariate time series data. This integrated approach enables the model to capture complex patterns and dependencies within the data. Additionally, the model skillfully maps series data into a latent space, utilizing a carefully crafted loss function to cluster normal data tightly in the latent space while dispersing abnormal data randomly. This innovative design results in distinct probability distributions for normal and abnormal data in the latent space, enabling precise identification of anomalous data. To evaluate the performance of our EDD model, we conducted extensive experimental validation across three diverse datasets. The results demonstrate the significant superiority of our model in multivariate time series anomaly detection. Specifically, the average F1-Score of our model outperformed the second-best method by 2.7% and 73.4% in both evaluation approaches, respectively, highlighting its superior detection capabilities. These findings validate the effectiveness of our proposed EDD model in leveraging limited anomaly samples for accurate and robust anomaly detection in multivariate time series data.">

        <tr id="Sensor drift has been one of the challenging problems in the development of electronic noses (E-noses), which can seriously affect the recognition accuracy of the sensor. In this article, a multibranch long short-term memory-attention ensemble classification network (MLAEC-Net) is proposed to address this problem. The framework simulates the working principle of the animal olfactory system and uses a multibranch structure to allow each branch to capture different features and attributes of the data. It combines the long short-term memory (LSTM) network and the attention mechanism to deal with long-term dependencies and extract key features. Furthermore, the framework improves the generalization ability and prediction accuracy of the overall model through the integration of classifiers. In addition, for E-nose systems with different numbers of sensors, it is only necessary to simply adjust the number of branches, providing excellent flexibility and generalizability to adapt to different sensor arrays and datasets. We validate the effectiveness of the MLAEC-Net framework by conducting experiments on two publicly available datasets. The experimental results show that the MLAEC-Net framework proposed in this article achieves significant advantages with better performance and robustness compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.">

        <tr id="Many multiplex graph representation learning (MGRL) methods have been demonstrated to 1) ignore the globally positive and negative relationships among node features; and 2) usually utilize the node classification task to train both graph structure learning and representation learning parameters, and thus resulting in the problem of edge starvation.

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new MGRL method based on the bi-level optimization. Specifically, in the inner level, we optimize the self-expression matrix to capture the globally positive and negative relationships among nodes, as well as complement them with the local relationships in graph structures. In the outer level, we optimize the parameters of the graph convolutional layer to obtain discriminative node representations. As a result, the graph structure optimization does not depend on the node classification task, which solves the edge starvation problem. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves the superior performance on node classification tasks on all datasets.">

        <tr id="With the proliferation of Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods stemming from contrastive learning, unsupervised node representation learning for graph data is rapidly gaining traction across various fields, from biology to molecular dynamics, where it is often used as a dimensionality reduction tool. However, there remains a significant gap in understanding the quality of the low-dimensional node representations these methods produce, particularly beyond well-curated academic datasets. To address this gap, we propose here the first comprehensive benchmarking of various unsupervised node embedding techniques tailored for dimensionality reduction, encompassing a range of manifold learning tasks, along with various performance metrics. We emphasize the sensitivity of current methods to hyperparameter choices -- highlighting a fundamental issue as to their applicability in real-world settings where there is no established methodology for rigorous hyperparameter selection. Addressing this issue, we introduce GNUMAP, a robust and parameter-free method for unsupervised node representation learning that merges the traditional UMAP approach with the expressivity of the GNN framework. We show that GNUMAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art GNN embedding methods in a variety of contexts, including synthetic geometric datasets, citation networks, and real-world biomedical data -- making it a simple but reliable dimensionality reduction tool.">
