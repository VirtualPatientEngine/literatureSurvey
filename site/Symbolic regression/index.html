        <tr id="Significance Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.">

        <tr id="Significance Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science. The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.">

        <tr id="Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.">

        <tr id="Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.">

        <tr id="Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.">

There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems (MANDy) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions.

For nonlinear systems, however, small modeling errors can lead to significant deviations from the true, measured behavior. Even in mechanical systems, where the equations are assumed to be well-known, there are often model discrepancies corresponding to nonlinear friction, wind resistance, etc. Discovering models for these discrepancies remains an open challenge for many complex systems. In this work, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to discover a model for the discrepancy between a simplified model and measurement data. In particular, we assume that the model mismatch can be sparsely represented in a library of candidate model terms.

However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further modification.">

        <tr id="Researchers propose sparse regression for identifying governing partial differential equations for spatiotemporal systems. We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.">

        <tr id="Sparse model identification enables the discovery of nonlinear dynamical systems purely from data; however, this approach is sensitive to noise, especially in the low-data limit. In this work, we leverage the statistical approach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to several synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate substantial improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected from 1900 to 1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be exploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.">

        <tr id="Regularized regression problems are ubiquitous in statistical modeling, signal processing, and machine learning. Sparse regression, in particular, has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: 1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning; 2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations; and 3) the methods apply to composite regularizers, essential for total variation (TV) as well as sparsity-promoting formulations using tight frames. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, and greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. Following standards of reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.">

        <tr id="The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective technique to produce interpretable models of dynamical systems from time-resolved state data via sparse regression. However, to model parameterized systems, SINDy requires data from transient trajectories for various parameter values over the range of interest, which are typically difficult to acquire experimentally. In this work, we extend SINDy to be able to leverage data on fixed points and/or limit cycles to reduce the number of transient trajectories needed for successful system identification. To achieve this, we incorporate the data on these attractors at various parameter values as constraints in the optimization problem. First, we show that enforcing these as hard constraints leads to an ill-conditioned regression problem due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we implement soft constraints by modifying the cost function to be minimized. This leads to the formulation of a multi-objective sparse regression problem where we simultaneously seek to minimize the error of the fit to the transients trajectories and to the data on attractors, while penalizing the number of terms in the model. Our extension, demonstrated on several numerical examples, is more robust to noisy measurements and requires substantially less training data than the original SINDy method to correctly identify a parameterized dynamical system.">

        <tr id="Identifying Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) from measurement data requires both fitting the dynamics and assimilating, either implicitly or explicitly, the measurement data. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method involves a derivative estimation step (and optionally, smoothing) and a sparse regression step on a library of candidate ODE terms. Kalman smoothing is a classical framework for assimilating the measurement data with known noise statistics. Previously, derivatives in SINDy and its python package, pysindy, had been estimated by finite difference, L1 total variation minimization, or local filters like Savitzky-Golay. In contrast, Kalman allows discovering ODEs that best recreate the essential dynamics in simulation, even in cases when it does not perform as well at recovering coefficients, as measured by their F1 score and mean absolute error. We have incorporated Kalman smoothing, along with hyperparameter optimization, into the existing pysindy architecture, allowing for rapid adoption of the method. Numerical experiments on a number of dynamical systems show Kalman smoothing to be the most amenable to parameter selection and best at preserving problem structure in the presence of noise.">

        <tr id="Enhancing the sparsity of data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) has gained increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we analyze an efficient approach to identifying skillful ROMs with a sparse structure using an information-theoretic indicator called causation entropy. The causation entropy quantifies in a statistical way the additional contribution of each term to the underlying dynamics beyond the information already captured by all the other terms in the ansatz. By doing so, the causation entropy assesses the importance of each term to the dynamics before a parameter estimation procedure is performed. Thus, the approach can be utilized to eliminate terms with little dynamic impact, leading to a parsimonious structure that retains the essential physics. To circumvent the difficulty of estimating high-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) involved in the causation entropy computation, we leverage Gaussian approximations for such PDFs, which are demonstrated to be sufficient even in the presence of highly non-Gaussian dynamics. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by building sparse causation-based ROMs for various purposes, such as recovering long-term statistics and inferring unobserved dynamics via data assimilation with partial observations.">

        <tr id="The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

SINDy is used to detect the system dynamics in the three well-known nonlinear systems. Analyzed are SINDy’s abilities to accurately represent transient/steady-state behaviour, noise effect, and model structure. A sparse set of basis functions can effectively capture the dynamics of a system, according to the data-driven approach known as SINDy. The coefficients of these basis functions are determined via methods of sparse regression, and the final model is made up of a number of sparse ordinary differential equations. The findings demonstrate that SINDy, with sufficient time-series data, can capture both transient and steady-state phenomena. According to the analysis of the noise effect, SINDy’s performance declines as the system’s noise level rises. The feature library must contain the appropriate model structure in order for SINDy to function effectively. SINDy has the potential to extract unknown system dynamics from experimental data.">

However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm.

        <tr id="In order to extract governing equations from time-series data, various approaches are proposed. Among those, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) stands out as a successful method capable of modeling governing equations with a minimal number of terms, utilizing the principles of compressive sensing. This feature, which relies on a small number of terms, is crucial for interpretability. The effectiveness of SINDy hinges on the choice of candidate functions within its dictionary to extract governing equations of dynamical systems. A larger dictionary allows for more terms, enhancing the quality of approximations. However, the computational complexity scales with dictionary size, rendering SINDy less suitable for high-dimensional datasets, even though it has been successfully applied to low-dimensional datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce iterative SINDy in this paper, where the dictionary undergoes expansion and compression through iterations. We also conduct an analysis of the convergence properties of iterative SINDy. Simulation results validate that iterative SINDy can achieve nearly identical performance to SINDy, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Notably, iterative SINDy demonstrates effectiveness with high-dimensional time-series data without incurring the prohibitively high computational cost associated with SINDy.">

We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps.

Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming.

However, it remains challenging to handle noisy data. To enhance robustness against noise, we incorporate the weak-form estimation of nonlinear dynamics (WENDy) into gLaSDI. In the proposed weak-form gLaSDI (WgLaSDI) framework, an autoencoder and WENDy are trained simultaneously to discover intrinsic nonlinear latent-space dynamics of high-dimensional data. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) employed in gLaSDI, WENDy enables variance reduction and robust latent space discovery, therefore leading to more accurate and efficient reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, the greedy physics-informed active learning in WgLaSDI enables adaptive sampling of optimal training data on the fly for enhanced modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various nonlinear dynamical problems, including viscous and inviscid Burgers' equations, time-dependent radial advection, and the Vlasov equation for plasma physics. With data that contains 5-10% Gaussian white noise, WgLaSDI outperforms gLaSDI by orders of magnitude, achieving 1-7% relative errors.

We obtain this model in a simple polynomial form that allows explicit identification of important physical system parameters, such as natural frequencies, linear and nonlinear damping and nonlinear stiffness. Beyond faithfully reproducing attracting steady states and limit cycles, our SSM-reduced models can also uncover hidden motion not seen in the video, such as unstable fixed points and unstable limit cycles forming basin boundaries. We demonstrate all these features on experimental videos of five physical systems: a double pendulum, an inverted flag in counter-flow, water sloshing in tank, a wing exhibiting aeroelastic flutter and a shimmying wheel.">

In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.">

The decision variable can be represented in the form of experimentally observable neural activities. Hence, elucidating the appropriate theoretical model becomes crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying perceptual decision formation. Existing computational methods are limited to either fitting of choice behavioural data or linear model estimation from neural activity data. In this work, we made use of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), a data-driven approach, to elucidate the deterministic linear and nonlinear components of often-used stochastic decision models within reaction time task paradigms. Based on the simulated decision variable activities of the models, SINDy, enhanced with a trial-averaging approach, could readily uncover the dynamical equations of the models while predicting the models' choice accuracy and decision time across a range of signal-to-noise ratio values. In particular, SINDy performed relatively better for decision models which have an accelerating dynamical component during decision formation, as expressed by a metastable linear competing accumulator model and a nonlinear bistable model. Taken together, our work suggests that SINDy can be a useful tool for uncovering the dynamics in perceptual decision-making, and more generally, for first-passage time problems.">

Our framework showcases four algorithms, each embedding a specific physics-based prior tailored to a particular class of nonlinear systems, including separable and nonseparable Hamiltonian systems, hyperbolic partial differential equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics. The intrinsic incorporation of physical laws preserves the system's intrinsic symmetries and conservation laws, ensuring solutions are physically plausible and computationally efficient. The integration of these priors also enhances the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns typical in physical phenomena that conventional methods often miss.

The computational efficiency of such surrogate models is especially important for design, exhaustive exploration and physical understanding. Plasma simulations, in particular those applied to the study of ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ plasma discharges and technologies, such as Hall thrusters, require substantial computational resources in order to resolve the multidimentional dynamics that span across wide spatial and temporal scales. Although high-fidelity computational tools are available to simulate such systems over limited conditions and in highly simplified geometries, simulations of full-size systems and/or extensive parametric studies over many geometric configurations and under different physical conditions are computationally intractable with conventional numerical tools. Thus, scientific studies and industrially oriented modeling of plasma systems, including the important ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ technologies, stand to significantly benefit from reduced order modeling algorithms. We develop a model reduction scheme based upon a {\em Shallow REcurrent Decoder} (SHRED) architecture. The scheme uses a neural network for encoding limited sensor measurements in time (sequence-to-sequence encoding) to full state-space reconstructions via a decoder network. Based upon the theory of separation of variables, the SHRED architecture is capable of (i) reconstructing full spatio-temporal fields with as little as three point sensors, even the fields that are not measured with sensor feeds but that are in dynamic coupling with the measured field, and (ii) forecasting the future state of the system using neural network roll-outs from the trained time encoding model.">

Some traditional approaches to nonlinear control often rely on local linearizations or complex nonlinear models, which can be inaccurate or computationally expensive. We present a data-driven approach to identify the dynamics of a given quadrotor system using Koopman operator theory. Koopman theory offers a framework for representing nonlinear dynamics as linear operators acting on observable functions of the state space. This allows to approximate nonlinear systems with globally linear models in a higher dimensional space, which can be analyzed and controlled using standard linear optimal control techniques. We leverage the method of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to identify Koopman operator from data with total least squares. We demonstrate that the identified model can be stabilized and controllable by designing a controller using linear quadratic regulator (LQR).">

However, in applications involving wider operating conditions, representation of the dynamics using a single linear dynamic model is often inadequate, requiring either a nonlinear model or multiple linear models to accommodate the nonlinear behaviour. While the development of the former suffers from the requirements of extensive experiments spanning multiple levels, significant compromise in the nominal product quality and dealing with unmeasured disturbances over wider operating conditions, the latter faces the challenge of model switch scheduling and inadequate description of dynamics for the operating regions in-between. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient approach to obtain a parsimonious nonlinear dynamic model by developing multiple linear models from data at multiple operating points, lifting the data features obtained from individual model simulations to adequately accommodate the underlying nonlinear behaviour and finally, sparse optimization techniques to obtain a parsimonious model. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulation case studies.">

        <tr id="Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that linearize nonlinear dynamical systems, facilitating the study of their spectral properties and enabling the prediction of the time evolution of observable quantities. Recent methods have aimed to approximate Koopman operators while preserving key structures. However, approximating Koopman operators typically requires a dictionary of observables to capture the system's behavior in a finite-dimensional subspace. The selection of these functions is often heuristic, may result in the loss of spectral information, and can severely complicate structure preservation. This paper introduces Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition (MultDMD), which enforces the multiplicative structure inherent in the Koopman operator within its finite-dimensional approximation. Leveraging this multiplicative property, we guide the selection of observables and define a constrained optimization problem for the matrix approximation, which can be efficiently solved. MultDMD presents a structured approach to finite-dimensional approximations and can more accurately reflect the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We elaborate on the theoretical framework of MultDMD, detailing its formulation, optimization strategy, and convergence properties. The efficacy of MultDMD is demonstrated through several examples, including the nonlinear pendulum, the Lorenz system, and fluid dynamics data, where we demonstrate its remarkable robustness to noise.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems often faces numerous data-related challenges. A fundamental requirement is the existence of a unique set of parameters for a chosen model structure, an issue commonly referred to as identifiability. Although this problem is well studied for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), few studies have focused on the more general class of systems described by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Examples of DAEs include dynamical systems with algebraic equations representing conservation laws or approximating fast dynamics. This work introduces a novel identifiability test for models characterized by nonlinear DAEs. Unlike previous approaches, our test only requires prior knowledge of the system equations and does not need nonlinear transformation, index reduction, or numerical integration of the DAEs. We employed our identifiability analysis across a diverse range of DAE models, illustrating how system identifiability depends on the choices of sensors, experimental conditions, and model structures. Given the added challenges involved in identifying DAEs when compared to ODEs, we anticipate that our findings will have broad applicability and contribute significantly to the development and validation of data-driven methods for DAEs and other structure-preserving models.">

        <tr id="Linearity of Koopman operators and simplicity of their estimators coupled with model-reduction capabilities has lead to their great popularity in applications for learning dynamical systems. While nonparametric Koopman operator learning in infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is well understood for autonomous systems, its control system analogues are largely unexplored. Addressing systems with control inputs in a principled manner is crucial for fully data-driven learning of controllers, especially since existing approaches commonly resort to representational heuristics or parametric models of limited expressiveness and scalability. We address the aforementioned challenge by proposing a universal framework via control-affine reproducing kernels that enables direct estimation of a single operator even for control systems. The proposed approach, called control-Koopman operator regression (cKOR), is thus completely analogous to Koopman operator regression of the autonomous case. First in the literature, we present a nonparametric framework for learning Koopman operator representations of nonlinear control-affine systems that does not suffer from the curse of control input dimensionality. This allows for reformulating the infinite-dimensional learning problem in a finite-dimensional space based solely on data without apriori loss of precision due to a restriction to a finite span of functions or inputs as in other approaches. For enabling applications to large-scale control systems, we also enhance the scalability of control-Koopman operator estimators by leveraging random projections (sketching). The efficacy of our novel cKOR approach is demonstrated on both forecasting and control tasks.">

Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict.

To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

        <tr id="Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.">

Such noise levels are eventually associated with probability distributions that, when combined with Bayes’ theorem, allow us to perform real-time state estimation. The proposed methodology is tested on two cases of challenging flows generated by an accelerating elliptical plate and also a delta wing experiencing gusts. Results specifically indicate that the proposed approach is robust against the number of clusters, enabling state estimation with a significant order reduction, notably decreasing the computational cost while preserving estimation accuracy.

        <tr id="Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.">

First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.">

 In this work, we consider the problem of learning a reduced-order model of a high-dimensional stochastic nonlinear system with control inputs from noisy data. In particular, we develop a hybrid parametric/non-parametric model that learns the “average” linear dynamics in the data using dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) and the nonlinearities and model uncertainties using Gaussian process (GP) regression and compare it with total least squares dynamic mode decomposition, extended here to systems with control inputs (tlsDMDc). The proposed approach is also compared with existing methods, such as DMDc-only and GP-only models, in two tasks: controlling the stochastic nonlinear Stuart-Landau equation and predicting the flowfield induced by a jet-like body force field in a turbulent boundary layer using data from large-scale numerical simulations.">

        <tr id="Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs and susceptibility to local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

        <tr id="The sudden onset of deleterious and oscillatory dynamics (often called instabilities) is a known challenge in many fluid, plasma, and aerospace systems. These dynamics are difficult to address because they are nonlinear, chaotic, and are often too fast for active control schemes. In this work, we develop an alternative active controls system using an iterative, trajectory-optimization and parameter-tuning approach based on Iterative Learning Control (ILC), Time-Lagged Phase Portraits (TLPP) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The novelty of this approach is that it can control a system's dynamics despite the controller being much slower than the dynamics. We demonstrate this controller on the Lorenz system of equations where it iteratively adjusts (tunes) the system's input parameters to successfully reproduce a desired oscillatory trajectory or state. Additionally, we investigate the system's dynamical sensitivity to its control parameters, identify continuous and bounded regions of desired dynamical trajectories, and demonstrate that the controller is robust to missing information and uncontrollable parameters as long as certain requirements are met. The controller presented in this work provides a framework for low-speed control for a variety of fast, nonlinear systems that may aid in instability suppression and mitigation.">

Traditional machine learning methods have advanced our ability to learn and predict such systems from observed time series data. However, predicting the behavior of systems with temporal parameter variations without knowledge of true parameter values remains a significant challenge. This study leverages the reservoir computing framework to address this problem by unsupervised extraction of slowly varying system parameters from time series data. We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data. Our approach shows potential for applications in fields such as neuroscience, material science, and weather prediction, where slow dynamics influencing qualitative changes are often unobservable.">

        <tr id="Reduced order modeling lowers the computational cost of solving PDEs by learning a low-order spatial representation from data and dynamically evolving these representations using manifold projections of the governing equations. While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.">

        <tr id="Data assimilation aims to estimate the states of a dynamical system by optimally combining sparse and noisy observations of the physical system with uncertain forecasts produced by a computational model. The states of many dynamical systems of interest obey nonlinear physical constraints, and the corresponding dynamics is confined to a certain sub-manifold of the state space. Standard data assimilation techniques applied to such systems yield posterior states lying outside the manifold, violating the physical constraints. This work focuses on particle flow filters which use stochastic differential equations to evolve state samples from a prior distribution to samples from an observation-informed posterior distribution. The variational Fokker-Planck (VFP) -- a generic particle flow filtering framework -- is extended to incorporate non-linear, equality state constraints in the analysis. To this end, two algorithmic approaches that modify the VFP stochastic differential equation are discussed: (i) VFPSTAB, to inexactly preserve constraints with the addition of a stabilizing drift term, and (ii) VFPDAE, to exactly preserve constraints by treating the VFP dynamics as a stochastic differential-algebraic equation (SDAE). Additionally, an implicit-explicit time integrator is developed to evolve the VFPDAE dynamics. The strength of the proposed approach for constraint preservation in data assimilation is demonstrated on three test problems: the double pendulum, Korteweg-de-Vries, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.">

However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.">

        <tr id="Structural damage detection is an inverse problem to identify and quantify structural damage from measurement data by discovering the variation of structural mechanical parameters. Recently, a novel deep learning framework named physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed and successfully applied to solve inverse problems of various linear/nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical information such as governing equations as prior information. In this study, we propose a PINN-based framework to exploit a novel method of structural damage detection. Specifically, a deep neural network model as the core of PINNs is built to predict the dynamic response in different degrees of freedom. The unknown mechanical parameters are initialized randomly and updated together with the neural network model parameters. Then, the structural physics model is embedded by calculating the residuals of governing equations as parts of the loss function. The residual between the predicted dynamic response and measurement data is also used as another part of the loss function. A two-step optimization strategy is proposed to obtain the best unknown parameter values that can fit the measurement data and governing equations simultaneously. Through numerical experiments of a single-degree-of-freedom system, we demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify potential structural mechanical parameters and quantitatively detect structural damage. The influence of sparsity and noise in the measurement data on the detection results is also analysed.">

A popular approach towards this end is to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to reproduce experimental recordings of neural activity. These trained RNNs are then treated as surrogate models of biological neural circuits, whose properties can be dissected via dynamical systems analysis. How reliable are the mechanistic insights derived from this procedure? While recent advances in population-level recording technologies have allowed simultaneous recording of up to tens of thousands of neurons, this represents only a tiny fraction of most cortical circuits. Here we show that observing only a subset of neurons in a circuit can create mechanistic mismatches between a simulated teacher network and a data-constrained student, even when the two networks have matching single-unit dynamics. In particular, partial observation of models of low-dimensional cortical dynamics based on functionally feedforward or low-rank connectivity can lead to surrogate models with spurious attractor structure. Our results illustrate the challenges inherent in accurately uncovering neural mechanisms from single-trial data, and suggest the need for new methods of validating data-constrained models for neural dynamics.">

Greedy samples are used to train a physics-informed neural network architecture which maps the nonlinear relation between spatio-temporal data and the measured values. To prove the impact of greedy samples on the training of the physics-informed neural network for parameter estimation of a partial differential equation, their performance is compared with random samples taken from the given dataset. Our simulation results show that for all considered partial differential equations, greedy samples outperform random samples, i.e., we can estimate parameters with a significantly lower number of samples while simultaneously reducing the relative estimation error.

When a sufficient amount of such I/O data are available, our method is capable of learning the unknown dynamics and producing an accurate predictive model for the stochastic responses of the system subject to arbitrary excitation signals not in the training data.

        <tr id="Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, more data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalizable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than the neural network alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularization, penalizing biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularization not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularization reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses. Author summary Systems biology concerns the modelling and analysis of biological processes, by viewing these as interconnected systems. Modelling is typically done either using mechanistic differential equations that are derived from experiments and known biology, or using machine learning on large biological datasets. While mathematical modelling from biological experiments can provide useful insights with limited data, building and validating these models takes a long time and often requires highly invasive measurements in humans. Efforts to combine this classical technique with machine learning have resulted in a framework termed universal differential equations, where the model equations contain a neural network to describe unknown biological interactions. While these methods have shown success in numerous fields, applications in biology are more challenging due to limited data-availability, high data sparsity. In this work, we have introduced physiology-informed regularization to overcome these instabilities and to constrain the model to biologically plausible behavior. Our results show that by using physiology-informed regularization, we can accurately predict future unseen observations in a simulated example, with much more limited data than a similar model without regularization. Additionally, we show an application of this technique on human data, applying a neural network to learn the appearance of glucose in the blood plasma after a meal.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we present a data-driven model predictive control (DDMPC) framework specifically designed for constrained single-input single-output (SISO) nonlinear systems. Our approach involves customizing a set-theoretic receding horizon controller within a data-driven context. To achieve this, we translate model-based conditions into data series of available input and output signals. This translation process leverages recent advances in data-driven control theory, enabling the controller to operate effectively without relying on explicit system models. The proposed framework incorporates a robust methodology for managing system constraints, ensuring that the control actions remain within predefined bounds. By means of time sequences, the controller learns the underlying system dynamics and adapts to changes in real time, providing enhanced performance and reliability. The integration of set-theoretic methods allows for the systematic handling of uncertainties and disturbances, which are common when the trajectory of a nonlinear system is embedded inside a linear trajectory state tube. To validate the effectiveness of our DDMPC framework, we conduct extensive simulations on a nonlinear DC motor system. The results demonstrate significant improvements in control performance, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of our approach compared to traditional model-based MPC techniques.">

        <tr id="This study presents the extension of the data-driven optimal prediction approach to the dynamical system with control. The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction. We experimentally confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for two Hamiltonian dynamical systems.">

It aims to estimate the state of a potentially large system, such as the atmosphere, from sparse observations, supplemented by prior physical knowledge. The size of the systems involved and the complexity of the underlying physical equations make it a challenging task from a computational point of view. Neural networks represent a promising method of emulating the physics at low cost, and therefore have the potential to considerably improve and accelerate data assimilation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning approach where the physical system is modeled as a sequence of coarse-to-fine Gaussian prior distributions parametrized by a neural network. This allows us to define an assimilation operator, which is trained in an end-to-end fashion to minimize the reconstruction error on a dataset with different observation processes. We illustrate our approach on chaotic dynamical physical systems with sparse observations, and compare it to traditional variational data assimilation methods.">

This paper considers a non-parametric data-driven identification of an overhead crane dynamics using symbolic regression techniques to find compromise between model complexity and predicted output accuracy. A grammar-guided genetic programming (G3P) combined with l 0 sparse regression is applied with two different variants of grammar to automatically construct a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model of different forms, termed extended and polynomial models. The proposed method is compared with a linear parameter-varying ARX (LPV-ARX) model. Identification is performed on experimental data ob - tained from a laboratory-scale overhead crane. The identified models are compared in terms of prediction accuracy, model’s complexity measured using number of model terms, and execution time. The regularized G3P method outperformed the LPV-ARX model in terms of model predictive output accuracy. The G3P with the extended gram - mar resulted in more accurate crane velocity prediction models than the models with the polynomial grammar. The payload sway prediction model with the polynomial grammar was less complex in all measured metrics while there was no statistical significance in the accuracy when compared to the models with extended grammar.">

Neural operators are neural networks that learn a mapping from the parameter space to the solution space of PDEs from data, and they can also solve the inverse problem of estimating the parameter from the solution. Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

However, they often rely on strong modeling assumptions and expensive numerical integration, requiring significant computational resources and domain expertise.

Furthermore, its predictions may disobey the governing physical laws and are difficult to interpret. Physics-guided DL aims to integrate first-principled physical knowledge into data-driven methods. It has the best of both worlds and is well equipped to better solve scientific problems.

In this paper, we propose an inference methodology for classical Kirchhoff-Love plates via physics-informed Gaussian Processes (GP). A probabilistic model is formulated as a multi-output GP by placing a GP prior on the deflection and deriving the covariance function using the linear differential operators of the plate governing equations. The posteriors of the flexural rigidity, hyperparameters, and plate response are inferred in a Bayesian manner using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from noisy measurements. We demonstrate the applicability with two examples: a simply supported plate subjected to a sinusoidal load and a fixed plate subjected to a uniform load. The results illustrate how the proposed methodology can be employed to perform stochastic inference for plate rigidity and physical quantities by integrating measurements from various sensor types and qualities. Potential applications of the presented methodology are in structural health monitoring and uncertainty quantification of plate-like structures.">

Coupling pHS via linear relations between input and output defines an overall pHS, which is structure preserving. However, in multiphysics applications, some subsystems do not allow for a physical pHS description, as (a) this is not available or (b) too expensive. Here, data-driven approaches can be used to deliver a pHS for such subsystems, which can then be coupled to the other subsystems in a structure-preserving way. In this work, we derive a data-driven identification approach for port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The approach uses input and state space data to estimate nonlinear effort functions of pH-DAEs. As underlying technique, we us (multi-task) Gaussian processes. This work thereby extends over the current state of the art, in which only port-Hamiltonian ordinary differential equation systems could be identified via Gaussian processes. We apply this approach successfully to two applications from network design and constrained multibody system dynamics, based on pH-DAE system of index one and three, respectively.">

However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs.

First, we introduce a method to extend an existing known model with an uncertainty model so that stability of the extended model is guaranteed in the sense of set invariance and input-to-state stability. To achieve this, we provide two tractable semi-definite programs. These programs allow obtaining optimal uncertainty model parameters for both locally and globally Lipschitz nonlinear models, given uncertainty and state trajectories. Subsequently, in order to extract this data from the available input-output trajectories, we introduce a filter that incorporates an approximated internal model of the uncertainty and asymptotically estimates uncertainty and state realizations. This filter is also synthesized using semi-definite programs with guaranteed robustness with respect to uncertainty model mismatches, disturbances, and noise. Numerical simulations for a large data-set of a roll plane model of a vehicle illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed methodology in improving model accuracy, while guaranteeing stability.">

The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs. We show, that for this particular task, RandONets outperform, both in terms of numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, the ``vanilla"DeepOnets.">

        <tr id="In this study, we investigate the potential of fast-to-evaluate surrogate modeling techniques for developing a hybrid digital twin of a steel-reinforced concrete beam, serving as a representative example of a civil engineering structure. As surrogates, two distinct models are developed utilizing physics-informed neural networks, which integrate experimental data with given governing laws of physics. The experimental data (sensor data) is obtained from a previously conducted four-point bending test. The first surrogate model predicts strains at fixed locations along the center line of the beam for various time instances. This time-dependent surrogate model is inspired by the motion of a harmonic oscillator. For this study, we further compare the physics-based approach with a purely data-driven method, revealing the significance of physical laws for the extrapolation capabilities of models in scenarios with limited access to experimental data. Furthermore, we identify the natural frequency of the system by utilizing the physics-based model as an inverse solver. For the second surrogate model, we then focus on a fixed instance in time and combine the sensor data with the equations of linear elasticity to predict the strain distribution within the beam. This example reveals the importance of balancing different loss components through the selection of suitable loss weights.">

Addressing the challenges posed by nonlinear FIDEs is a recognized difficulty, necessitating the application of generic methods with immediate practical relevance. This work introduces the Universal Fractional Integro-Differential Equation Solvers (UniFIDES), a comprehensive machine learning platform designed to expeditiously solve a variety of FIDEs in both forward and inverse directions, without the need for ad hoc manipulation of the equations. The effectiveness of UniFIDES is demonstrated through a collection of integer-order and fractional problems in science and engineering.

Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

We explore using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling dynamic processes governed by differential-algebraic equation systems when process data is scarce and complete mechanistic knowledge is missing. In particular, we focus on estimating states for which neither direct observational data nor constitutive equations are available. For demonstration purposes, we study a continuously stirred tank reactor and a liquid-liquid separator. We find that PINNs can infer unmeasured states with reasonable accuracy, and they generalize better in low-data scenarios than purely data-driven models. We thus show that PINNs, similar to hybrid mechanistic/data-driven models, are capable of modeling processes when relatively few experimental data and only partially known mechanistic descriptions are available, and conclude that they constitute a promising avenue that warrants further investigation.">

        <tr id="Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

For this, a Koopman eigenstructure assignment problem is solved, which amounts to determine a feedback of the Koopman open-loop eigenfunctionals assigning a desired finite set of closed-loop Koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctionals to the closed-loop system. It is shown that the designed controller only needs a finite number of open-loop Koopman eigenvalues and modes of the state. They are determined by extending the classical Krylov-DMD to parabolic systems. For this, only a finite number of pointlike outputs and their temporal samples as well as temporal samples of the inputs are required resulting in a data-driven solution of the eigenstructure assignment problem. Exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of small Krylov-DMD errors is verified.

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

        <tr id="Parameter estimation is one of the central problems in computational modeling of biological systems. Typically, scientists must fully specify the mathematical structure of the model, often expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations, to estimate the parameters. This process poses significant challenges due to the necessity for a detailed understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating model parameters and assessing their identifiability in situations where only partial knowledge of the system structure is available. The partially known model is extended into a system of Hybrid Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, which captures the unknown portions of the system using neural networks. Integrating neural networks into the model structure introduces two primary challenges for parameter estimation: the need to globally explore the search space while employing gradient-based optimization, and the assessment of parameter identifiability, which may be hindered by the expressive nature of neural networks. To overcome the first issue, we treat biological parameters as hyperparameters in the extended model, exploring the parameter search space during hyperparameter tuning. The second issue is then addressed by an a posteriori analysis of parameter identifiability, computed by introducing a variant of a well-established approach for mechanistic models. These two components are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that is thoroughly described in the paper. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on test cases derived from three different benchmark models. These test cases have been designed to mimic real-world conditions, including the presence of noise in the training data and various levels of data availability for the system variables. Author summary Parameter estimation is a central challenge in modeling biological systems. Typically, scientists calibrate the parameters by aligning model predictions with measured data once the model structure is defined. Our paper introduces a workflow that leverages the integration between mechanistic modeling and machine learning to estimate model parameters when the model structure is not fully known. We focus mainly on analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters, which measures how confident we can be in the parameter estimates given the available experimental data and partial mechanistic understanding of the system. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach in various in silico scenarios. Our workflow represents a first step to adapting traditional methods used in fully mechanistic models to the scenario of hybrid modeling.">

        <tr id="Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.">

        <tr id="Triple decomposition is a useful analytical method for extracting the mean value, organized coherent motion, and stochastic part from a fluctuating quantity. Although the pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) method is widely used to measure the pressure distribution on a surface, the PSP data measuring near atmospheric pressure contain significant noise. Here, we perform triple decomposition of noisy PSP data. To construct phase-averaged data representing an organized coherent motion, we propose a relatively simple method based on a multi-dimensional scaling plot of the cosine similarity between each PSP datum. Then, the stochastic part is extracted by selecting phase-averaged data with an appropriate phase angle based on the similarity between the measurement and phase-averaged data. As a data-driven approach, we also reconstruct the pressure distribution based on the triple decomposition and the pressure data at sparse optimal sensor positions determined from the proper orthogonal decomposition modes of the stochastic part. The optimal sensor positions are determined as a combinatorial optimization problem and are estimated using Fujitsu computing as a service digital annealer. Based on the results obtained, the root mean square error between the pressure measured by a pressure transducer and the reconstructed pressure obtained by the proposed method is small, even when the number of modes and sensor points is small. The application of PSP measurement is expected to expand further, and the framework for calculating triple decomposition and sparse representation based on the decomposition will be useful for flow analysis.">

However, currently available neural network-based modeling approaches fall short when faced with data collected randomly over time and space, as is often the case with sensor networks in real-world applications like crowdsourced earthquake detection or pollution monitoring. In response, we developed a new spatiotemporal method that effectively handles such randomly sampled data. Our model integrates techniques from amortized variational inference, neural differential equations, neural point processes, and implicit neural representations to predict both the dynamics of the system and the probabilistic locations and timings of future observations. It outperforms existing methods on challenging spatiotemporal datasets by offering substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a useful tool for modeling and understanding complex dynamical systems observed under realistic, unconstrained conditions.">

 Deterministic Neural Networks (NNs) have been widely adopted to represent system behaviors in various engineering problems, which have been criticized for providing overconfident predictions. This challenge, i.e., overfitting, refers to a model that captures data patterns and random noise during the learning process, leading to an inferior predictive capability in the unobserved domains. As known to all, Bayesian inference offers an effective way for uncertainty quantification (UQ) to help enhance model predictions and offer informed decision-making. Integrating deterministic NN models with Bayesian inference provides a way to fast simulate and quantify both data and model uncertainty simultaneously. Thereby, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), a combination of standard NNs with Bayesian philosophy, introduce probability to the network parameters, i.e., biases and weights. In BNNs, predictive uncertainty reflects how confident model predictions are regarding the corresponding credible intervals, which helps identify overfitting and interpreting abnormal predictions. Another advantage is that BNNs naturally implement regularization by integrating over the weights such that BNNs can reach good generalization when data availability is limited. BNNs rely heavily on observations as a purely data-driven approach. Besides, standard BNNs have relatively complex network structures, which makes it hard to provide detailed interpretability on model predictions. Researchers share concerns about their predictions that may violate real-world phenomena. The combination of physics knowledge with the optimization objective can improve the adherence of predictions with the known physical principles. Physics laws are usually embedded as constraint functions in the process of optimization. With the help of constrained optimization, model predictions keep consistent with the known physical principles.
 The authors refine BNNs with physics-guided information, i.e., Physics-Guided BNNs (PG-BNNs), to reduce dependence on data, improve model interpretability, and offer reliable model predictions. PG-BNNs interpret the known physics knowledge as constraint functions to better guide optimization processes, especially for case studies with sparse and limited data sets. A case study of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) problem is carried out to compare the performance of PG-BNN and unconstrained BNN models and demonstrate the effectiveness of PG-BNN.">

        <tr id="Single-cell time series data frequently display considerable variability across a cell population. The current gold standard for inferring parameter distributions across cell populations is the Global Two Stage (GTS) approach for nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models. However, this method is computationally intensive, as it makes repeated use of non-convex optimization that in turn requires numerical integration of the underlying system. Here, we propose the Gradient Matching GTS (GMGTS) method as an efficient alternative to GTS. Gradient matching offers an integration-free approach to parameter estimation that is particularly powerful for dynamical systems that are linear in the unknown parameters, such as biochemical networks modeled by mass action kinetics. Here, we harness the power of gradient matching by integrating it into the GTS framework. To this end, we significantly expand the capabilities of gradient matching via uncertainty propagation calculations and the development of an iterative estimation scheme for partially observed systems. Through comparisons of GMGTS with GTS in different inference setups, we demonstrate that our method provides a significant computational advantage, thereby facilitating the use of complex NLME models in systems biology applications.">

        <tr id="Traditional low-rank approximation is a powerful tool to compress the huge data matrices that arise in simulations of partial differential equations (PDE), but suffers from high computational cost and requires several passes over the PDE data. The compressed data may also lack interpretability thus making it difficult to identify feature patterns from the original data. To address this issue, we present an online randomized algorithm to compute the interpolative decomposition (ID) of large-scale data matrices in situ. Compared to previous randomized IDs that used the QR decomposition to determine the column basis, we adopt a streaming ridge leverage score-based column subset selection algorithm that dynamically selects proper basis columns from the data and thus avoids an extra pass over the data to compute the coefficient matrix of the ID. In particular, we adopt a single-pass error estimator based on the non-adaptive Hutch++ algorithm to provide real-time error approximation for determining the best coefficients. As a result, our approach only needs a single pass over the original data and thus is suitable for large and high-dimensional matrices stored outside of core memory or generated in PDE simulations. We also provide numerical experiments on turbulent channel flow and ignition simulations, and on the NSTX Gas Puff Image dataset, comparing our algorithm with the offline ID algorithm to demonstrate its utility in real-world applications.">

This work describes a data-driven technique to create high-fidelity low-dimensional models of flexible fiber dynamics using machine learning; the technique is applied to sedimentation in a quiescent, viscous Newtonian fluid, using results from detailed simulations as the data set. The approach combines an autoencoder neural network architecture to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the filament shape, with a neural ODE that learns the evolution of the particle in the latent state. The model was designed to model filaments of varying flexibility, characterized by an elasto-gravitational number $\mathcal{B}$, and was trained on a data set containing the evolution of fibers beginning at set angles of inclination. For the range of $\mathcal{B}$ considered here (100-10000), the filament shape dynamics can be represented with high accuracy with only four degrees of freedom, in contrast to the 93 present in the original bead-spring model used to generate the dynamic trajectories. We predict the evolution of fibers set at arbitrary angles and demonstrate that our data-driven model can accurately forecast the evolution of a fiber at both trained and untrained elasto-gravitational numbers.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

Whilst numerical methods are higher fidelity, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning methods on the other hand are lower fidelity but provide significant speed-ups. The emergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in fluid dynamics has allowed scientists to directly use PDEs for evaluating loss functions in an unsupervised manner. The downfall of this approach is that the differential form of systems is invalid at regions of shock inherent in hyperbolic PDEs such as the compressible Euler equations. To circumvent this problem we propose a modification to PDE-based PINN losses by using a finite volume-based loss function that incorporates the flux of Godunov-type methods. These Godunov-type methods are also known as approximate Riemann solvers and evaluate intercell fluxes in an entropy-satisfying manner, yielding more physically accurate shocks. Our approach increases fidelity compared to using regularized PDE-based PINN losses, as tested on the 2D Riemann problem.">

Firstly, we point out that the outputs of the last hidden layer of a deep NN implicitly construct a basis in a so-called neural (feature) space, while the output linear layer performs affine interpolation in the neural space. As such, we can train off-line a deep NN using large data sets of trajectories to learn the neural basis and compute on-line a suitable affine interpolation using DeePC.

The DLF was developed specifically for hyperbolic problems -waves-, and in this paper, it is extended via a split step formulation, to handle advection-diffusion problems. In the dynamic likelihood approach, observations and their statistics are used to propagate probabilities along characteristics, evolving the likelihood in time. The estimate posterior thus inherits phase information. For advection-diffusion the advective part of the time evolution is handled on the basis of observations alone, while the diffusive part is informed through the model as well as observations. We expect, and indeed show here, that in advection-dominated problems, the DLF approach produces better estimates than other assimilation approaches, particularly when the observations are sparse and have low uncertainty. The added computational expense of the method is cubic in the total number of observations over time, which is on the same order of magnitude as a standard Kalman filter and can be mitigated by bounding the number of forward propagated observations, discarding the least informative data.">

While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

We propose Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) for data assimilation on nonlinear state space models (SSMs). DBF constructs new latent variables $h_t$ on a new latent (``fancy'') space and assimilates observations $o_t$. By (i) constraining the state transition on fancy space to be linear and (ii) learning a Gaussian inverse observation operator $q(h_t|o_t)$, posteriors always remain Gaussian for DBF. Quite distinctively, the structured design of posteriors provides an analytic formula for the recursive computation of posteriors without accumulating Monte-Carlo sampling errors over time steps. DBF seeks the Gaussian inverse observation operators $q(h_t|o_t)$ and other latent SSM parameters (e.g., dynamics matrix) by maximizing the evidence lower bound. Experiments show that DBF outperforms model-based approaches and latent assimilation methods in various tasks and conditions.">

Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise.

In such cases, particular care must be taken to preserve structure on both local and mortar levels without knowledge of the governing equations, as well as to ensure well-posedness and stability of the resulting monolithic data-driven system. This strategy provides a flexible means of both scaling to large systems and treating complex geometries, and is particularly attractive for multiscale problems with complex microstructure geometry. While consistency is traditionally obtained in finite element methods via quasi-optimality results and the Bramble-Hilbert lemma as the local element diameter $h\rightarrow0$, our analysis establishes notions of accuracy and stability for finite h with accuracy coming from matching data. Numerical experiments and analysis establish properties for $H(\operatorname{div})$ problems in small data limits ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ reference solutions).">

        <tr id="Physics informed neural networks have been gaining popularity due to their unique ability to incorporate physics laws into data-driven models, ensuring that the predictions are not only consistent with empirical data but also align with domain-specific knowledge in the form of physics equations. The integration of physics principles enables the method to require less data while maintaining the robustness of deep learning in modeling complex dynamical systems. However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Preliminary results indicate that physics-informed machine learning holds significant potential for advancing the study of ecological systems.">

Hitherto, it has been separately addressed by employing operator learning surrogates for field prediction while using simulation-based inference (and its variants) for statistical parameter determination. Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.">

The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries. These results highlight the unique generalization capability of the proposed operator learning approach.">

We believe that many of these adaptations correspond to optimal solutions driven by evolution, training, and underlying physical and chemical laws and constraints. While some argue against such optimality principles due to their potential ambiguity, we propose generalized inverse optimal control to infer them directly from data. This novel approach incorporates multi-criteria optimality, nestedness of objective functions on different scales, the presence of active constraints, the possibility of switches of optimality principles during the observed time horizon, maximization of robustness, and minimization of time as important special cases, as well as uncertainties involved with the mathematical modeling of biological systems. This data-driven approach ensures that optimality principles are not merely theoretical constructs but are firmly rooted in experimental observations. Furthermore, the inferred principles can be used in forward optimal control to predict and manipulate biological systems, with possible applications in bio-medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. As discussed and illustrated, the well-posed problem formulation and the inference are challenging and require a substantial interdisciplinary effort in the development of theory and robust numerical methods.">

A common approach to modeling is to develop a system of equations that encode the known biology using approximations and simplifying assumptions. As a result, the same signaling pathway can be represented by multiple models, each with its set of underlying assumptions, which opens up challenges for model selection and decreases certainty in model predictions. Here, we use Bayesian multimodel inference to develop a framework to increase certainty in systems biology models. Using models of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we first show that multimodel inference increases predictive certainty and yields predictors that are robust to changes in the set of available models. We then show that predictions made with multi-model inference are robust to data uncertainties introduced by decreasing the measurement duration and reducing the sample size. Finally, we use multimodel inference to identify a new model to explain experimentally measured sub-cellular location-specific ERK activity dynamics. In summary, our framework highlights multimodel inference as a disciplined approach to increasing the certainty of intracellular signaling activity predictions.">

In recent years, research endeavors have focused on the development of a fully automated system for glucose control through automated insulin injections, known as Artificial Pancreas, which, however, is not yet robust enough for practical use. Currently, the UVA/Padova simulator provides the most accurate model for effectively representing the insulin-glucose dynamics of individual diabetic patients. As it is highly complex, consisting of 18 strongly nonlinear and time-varying equations, the objective of this work is to linearize it and reduce its dimensionality exploiting Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control. This allows for the synthesis of a controller based on Linear Model Predictive Control to be applied to the original model. This is justified by the need to integrate the control algorithm into portable devices with limited computational capabilities. The proposed dimensionality reduction method is validated through in-vitro simulations showing that an accurate representation of the system dynamics is effectively preserved, while conveniently reducing required computational power.">

The DC framework differs from traditional Bayesian approaches due to the incorporation of the push-forward of an initial density, which performs selective regularization in parameter directions not informed by the data in the resulting updated density. This extends a previous study that included the linear Gaussian theory within the DC framework and introduced the maximal updated density (MUD) estimate as an alternative to both least squares and maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates. In this work, we introduce algorithms for operational settings of MUD estimation in real or near-real time where spatio-temporal datasets arrive in packets to provide updated estimates of parameters and identify potential parameter drift. Computational diagnostics within the DC framework prove critical for evaluating (1) the quality of the DC update and MUD estimate and (2) the detection of parameter value drift. The algorithms are applied to estimate (1) wind drag parameters in a high-fidelity storm surge model, (2) thermal diffusivity field for a heat conductivity problem, and (3) changing infection and incubation rates of an epidemiological model.">

Existing methods aim to reconstruct STTD using low-dimensional models. However, they are limited to data-specific dimensions or source-dependent patterns, restricting them from unifying representations. Here, we present a novel paradigm to address the STTD learning problem by parameterizing STTD as an implicit neural representation. To discern the underlying dynamics in low-dimensional regimes, coordinate-based neural networks that can encode high-frequency structures are employed to directly map coordinates to traffic variables. To unravel the entangled spatial-temporal interactions, the variability is decomposed into separate processes. We further enable modeling in irregular spaces such as sensor graphs using spectral embedding. Through continuous representations, our approach enables the modeling of a variety of STTD with a unified input, thereby serving as a generalized learner of the underlying traffic dynamics. It is also shown that it can learn implicit low-rank priors and smoothness regularization from the data, making it versatile for learning different dominating data patterns. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments in real-world scenarios, showcasing applications from corridor to network scales. Empirical results not only indicate that our model has significant superiority over conventional low-rank models, but also highlight that the versatility of the approach extends to different data domains, output resolutions, and network topologies. Comprehensive model analyses provide further insight into the inductive bias of STTD. We anticipate that this pioneering modeling perspective could lay the foundation for universal representation of STTD in various real-world tasks.">

The latter are defined as balls in the Wasserstein metric centered on the predictive empirical distribution computed from a set of collected trajectory data. By harnessing techniques from robust control and distributionally robust optimization, we characterize the distributional shift between the predictive and the actual closed-loop distributions, and highlight its dependency on the model mismatch and the uncertainty about the disturbance distribution. We also provide bounds on the number of samples required to achieve a desired confidence level and propose a tractable approximate formulation for the doubly robust data-driven controller.

        <tr id="In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.">

        <tr id="This paper is about learning the parameter-to-solution map for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) that depend on a potentially large number of parameters covering all PDE types for which a stable variational formulation (SVF) can be found. A central constituent is the notion of variationally correct residual loss function meaning that its value is always uniformly proportional to the squared solution error in the norm determined by the SVF, hence facilitating rigorous a posteriori accuracy control. It is based on a single variational problem, associated with the family of parameter dependent fiber problems, employing the notion of direct integrals of Hilbert spaces. Since in its original form the loss function is given as a dual test norm of the residual a central objective is to develop equivalent computable expressions. A first critical role is played by hybrid hypothesis classes, whose elements are piecewise polynomial in (low-dimensional) spatio-temporal variables with parameter-dependent coefficients that can be represented, e.g. by neural networks. Second, working with first order SVFs, we distinguish two scenarios: (i) the test space can be chosen as an $L_2$-space (e.g. for elliptic or parabolic problems) so that residuals live in $L_2$ and can be evaluated directly; (ii) when trial and test spaces for the fiber problems (e.g. for transport equations) depend on the parameters, we use ultraweak formulations. In combination with Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin concepts the hybrid format is then instrumental to arrive at variationally correct computable residual loss functions. Our findings are illustrated by numerical experiments representing (i) and (ii), namely elliptic boundary value problems with piecewise constant diffusion coefficients and pure transport equations with parameter dependent convection field.">

        <tr id="Quadrotors, valued for their mobility and cost-effectiveness, have found widespread use in applications such as aerial photography and infrastructure inspection. However, their complex and nonlinear dynamics make them sensitive to uncertainties. In dynamic scenarios with online data but little-to-no prior knowledge of these unknowns, data-driven approaches show promise in both system identification and controller design. Nonetheless, the black-box nature of deep learning poses challenges for trust and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce a novel tracking controller featuring an online learning module for quadrotor residual dynamics. This module, implemented using deep Echo State Network (ESN), enhances adaptability to unforeseen scenarios, thereby extending the applicability of the controller to a broader range of situations. Furthermore, we employ post-hoc interpretation techniques tailored for the ESN to improve trustworthiness. This is achieved through dynamic system analysis and visualization of network predictions. Simulation results demonstrate the effective tracking of a figure-8 trajectory with online learning compensating for various non-parametric uncertainties, which showcases the potential of the proposed approach and estab-lishes a foundation for the real-world testing in future.">

When the intrinsic noise intensity is large, these systems exhibits stochastic transitions from one metastable steady state to another. In electronic bistable memories, these transitions are failures, usually simulated in a Monte-Carlo fashion at a high CPU-time price. Existing closed-form formulas, relying on near-stable-steady-state approximations of the nonlinear system dynamics to estimate the mean transition time, have turned out inaccurate. Our contribution is twofold. From a unidimensional stochastic model of overdamped autonomous systems, we propose an extended Eyring-Kramers analytical formula accounting for both nonlinear drift and state-dependent white noise variance, rigorously derived from Itô stochastic calculus. We also adapt it to practical system engineering situations where the intrinsic noise sources are hidden and can only be inferred from the fluctuations of observables measured in steady states. First numerical trials on an industrial electronic case study suggest that our approximate prediction formula achieve remarkable accuracy, outperforming previous non-Monte-Carlo approaches.">

However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.">

Reverse engineering is an alternative approach, where time series data are utilized to infer or fit a stochastic differential equation. This process, known as system reconstruction, presents significant challenges. This paper addresses the estimation of the (often) non-linear deterministic and stochastic parts of Langevin models, one of the simplest yet commonly used stochastic differential equations. We introduce a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) inference method, termed Euler reconstruction, tailored for time series data with medium to high resolution. However, the Euler approach is not reliable for low-resolution data. To fill the gap for sparsely sampled data, we present an MLE inference method pioneered by Aït-Sahalia, that we term Hermite reconstruction. We employ a powerful modeling framework utilizing splines to detect inherent nonlinearities in the unknown data-generating system to achieve high accuracy with minimal computational burden. Applying Euler and Hermite reconstructions to a range of simulated, ecological, and climate datasets, we demonstrate their efficacy and versatility.

Preconditioners are often necessary to achieve fast convergence When solving these linear systems using iterative solvers. We can use preconditioner updates for closely related systems instead of computing a preconditioner for each system from scratch. One such preconditioner update is the sparse approximate map (SAM), which is based on the sparse approximate inverse preconditioner using a least squares approximation. A SAM then acts as a map from one matrix in the sequence to another nearby one for which we have an effective preconditioner. To efficiently compute an effective SAM update (i.e., one that facilitates fast convergence of the iterative solver), we seek to compute an optimal sparsity pattern. In this paper, we examine several sparsity patterns for computing the SAM update to characterize optimal or near-optimal sparsity patterns for linear systems arising from discretized PDEs.">

        <tr id="Practical parameter identifiability in ODE-based epidemiological models is a known issue, yet one that merits further study. It is essentially ubiquitous due to noise and errors in real data. In this study, to avoid uncertainty stemming from data of unknown quality, simulated data with added noise are used to investigate practical identifiability in two distinct epidemiological models. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of initial conditions, which are assumed unknown, except those that are directly measured. Instead of just focusing on one method of estimation, we use and compare results from various broadly used methods, including maximum likelihood and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation. Among other findings, our analysis revealed that the MCMC estimator is overall more robust than the point estimators considered. Its estimates and predictions are improved when the initial conditions of certain compartments are fixed so that the model becomes globally identifiable. For the point estimators, whether fixing or fitting the that are not directly measured improves parameter estimates is model-dependent. Specifically, in the standard SEIR model, fixing the initial condition for the susceptible population S(0) improved parameter estimates, while this was not true when fixing the initial condition of the asymptomatic population in a more involved model. Our study corroborates the change in quality of parameter estimates upon usage of pre-peak or post-peak time-series under consideration. Finally, our examples suggest that in the presence of significantly noisy data, the value of structural identifiability is moot.">

        <tr id="This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning (ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems found in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by differential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and hard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and no-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these constraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate algorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply training unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the differential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this approach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models innately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the well-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact) min-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for these infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then provide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are not only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even dominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly, these results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed problems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms used by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical systems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems with embedded optimal control problems.">

These predictions are typically made by solving the governing equations of continuum mechanics using finite element analysis, which can become computationally prohibitive considering complex microstructures and material behaviors. Machine learning (ML) methods offer potentially cost effective surrogates for these applications. However, existing ML surrogates are either limited to low-dimensional problems and/or do not provide uncertainty estimates in the predictions. This work proposes an ML surrogate framework for stress field prediction and uncertainty quantification for diverse materials microstructures. A modified Bayesian U-net architecture is employed to provide a data-driven image-to-image mapping from initial microstructure to stress field with prediction (epistemic) uncertainty estimates. The Bayesian posterior distributions for the U-net parameters are estimated using three state-of-the-art inference algorithms: the posterior sampling-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method and two variational approaches, the Monte-Carlo Dropout method and the Bayes by Backprop algorithm. A systematic comparison of the predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimates for these methods is performed for a fiber reinforced composite material and polycrystalline microstructure application. It is shown that the proposed methods yield predictions of high accuracy compared to the FEA solution, while uncertainty estimates depend on the inference approach. Generally, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Bayes by Backprop methods provide consistent uncertainty estimates. Uncertainty estimates from Monte Carlo Dropout, on the other hand, are more difficult to interpret and depend strongly on the method's design.">

Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks.

Fusing known physics into data-driven learners allows modelling practitioners to combine the expressive power of traditional machine learning with known mechanistic laws, where the objective is to enhance predictive performance, interpretability, and model generalisation. A core consideration that must be made when implementing a physics-informed learning architecture is how relevant knowledge will be embedded into the model structure, which, generally, is informed by the type of physics that is available. Frequently this knowledge may not be complete, with only a partial understanding of the governing physics available. 

In this work, possible paths for deriving Gaussian process kernels that are representative of partial knowledge will be considered. How the type of knowledge that is possessed influences the derivation will be explored, particularly when there is the potential for some aspect of misspecified physics. An example of deriving partially structured kernels will be investigated for modelling the decoupled response of a GARTEUR laboratory aircraft structure, where the derived kernels are used to decompose the dynamics of the aircraft into modal contributions.

BENN is capable of constraining not only the predicted values but also their derivatives and variances, ensuring a more robust and reliable model output. To achieve simultaneous uncertainty quantification and constraint satisfaction, we employ the method of multipliers approach. This allows for the concurrent estimation of neural network parameters and the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the constraints. Our experiments, spanning diverse applications such as beam deflection modeling and microstructure generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of BENN. The results highlight significant improvements over traditional BNNs and showcase competitive performance relative to contemporary constrained deep learning methods.">

        <tr id="Using neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) is gaining popularity as an alternative approach in the scientific computing community. Neural networks can integrate different types of information into the loss function. These include observation data, governing equations, and variational forms, etc. These loss functions can be broadly categorized into two types: observation data loss directly constrains and measures the model output, while other loss functions indirectly model the performance of the network, which can be classified as model loss. However, this alternative approach lacks a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms, including theoretical foundations and rigorous characterization of various phenomena. This work focuses on investigating how different loss functions impact the training of neural networks for solving PDEs. We discover a stable loss-jump phenomenon: when switching the loss function from the data loss to the model loss, which includes different orders of derivative information, the neural network solution significantly deviates from the exact solution immediately. Further experiments reveal that this phenomenon arises from the different frequency preferences of neural networks under different loss functions. We theoretically analyze the frequency preference of neural networks under model loss. This loss-jump phenomenon provides a valuable perspective for examining the underlying mechanisms of neural networks in solving PDEs.">

The goal of our work is to answer the question of how one should excite or control a system under consideration in an appropriate way to be able to reconstruct an unknown nonlinear relation. To answer this question, we propose a greedy reconstruction algorithm within an offline-online strategy. We apply this strategy to a two-dimensional semilinear elliptic model. Our identification is based on the application of several space-dependent excitations (also called controls). These specific controls are designed by the algorithm in order to obtain a deeper insight into the underlying physical problem and a more precise reconstruction of the unknown relation. We perform numerical simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which is not limited to the current type of equation. Since our algorithm provides not only a way to determine unknown operators by existing data but also protocols for new experiments, it is a holistic concept to tackle the problem of improving physical models.">

This paper presents an automatic method to derive unknown or uncertain (sub)models using longitudinal, heterogeneous data. Initially, we employ deep nonlinear mixed effect (DeepNLME) to train a neural network as a universal approximator, which then generates a parameterized representation of the underlying process. Subsequently, we apply symbolic regression to identify a set of potential models expressed as equations. Within the study parameters, the proposed method outperforms the baseline models and demonstrates the validity of both the DeepNLME approach and the symbolic regression approach.">

        <tr id="Physics-guided neural networks (PGNN) is an effective tool that combines the benefits of data-driven modeling with the interpretability and generalization of underlying physical information. However, for a classical PGNN, the penalization of the physics-guided part is at the output level, which leads to a conservative result as systems with highly similar state-transition functions, i.e. only slight differences in parameters, can have significantly different time-series outputs. Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.">

We discover four families of integrable PDEs, one of which was previously known, and three of which have at least one conserved quantity but are new to the literature to the best of our knowledge. We investigate more deeply the properties of one of these novel PDE families, $u_t = (u_x+a^2u_{xxx})^3$.

        <tr id="Predicting cancer dynamics under treatment is challenging due to high inter-patient heterogeneity, lack of predictive biomarkers, and sparse and noisy longitudinal data. Mathematical models can summarize cancer dynamics by a few interpretable parameters per patient. Machine learning methods can then be trained to predict the model parameters from baseline covariates, but do not account for uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Instead, hierarchical Bayesian modeling can model the relationship between baseline covariates to longitudinal measurements via mechanistic parameters while accounting for uncertainty in every part of the model. The mapping from baseline covariates to model parameters can be modeled in several ways. A linear mapping simplifies inference but fails to capture nonlinear covariate effects and scale poorly for interaction modeling when the number of covariates is large. In contrast, Bayesian neural networks can potentially discover interactions between covariates automatically, but at a substantial cost in computational complexity. In this work, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of subpopulation dynamics that uses baseline covariate information to predict cancer dynamics under treatment, inspired by cancer dynamics in multiple myeloma (MM), where serum M protein is a well-known proxy of tumor burden. As a working example, we apply the model to a simulated dataset and compare its ability to predict M protein trajectories to a model with linear covariate effects. Our results show that the Bayesian neural network covariate effect model predicts cancer dynamics more accurately than a linear covariate effect model when covariate interactions are present. The framework can also be applied to other types of cancer or other time series prediction problems that can be described with a parametric model.">

The learned representation can be used for downstream machine-learning tasks such as clustering and classification. The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality.

However, different types of ML models may have contrasting advantages and disadvantages, which become critical during the optimal selection of a specific data‐driven model for a particular application as well as estimation of parameters during model training. This paper compares and contrasts two different types of data‐driven modelling approaches, namely the series/parallel all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural network models and models from a Bayesian ML approach. Both types of AI modelling approaches considered in this work have shown to significantly outperform several state‐of‐the‐art steady‐state and dynamic data‐driven modelling techniques for various performance measures, specifically, model sparsity, predictive capabilities, and computational expense. The performances of the proposed model structures and algorithms have been evaluated for two nonlinear dynamic chemical engineering systems—a plug‐flow reactor for vapour phase cracking of acetone for production of acetic anhydride and a pilot‐plant for post‐combustion CO2 capture using monoethanolamine as the solvent. For the validation data from the CO2 capture pilot plant, root mean squared error (RMSE) for flue gas outlet temperature, flowrate and CO2 concentration is 0.05%, 1.07%, and 5.0%, respectively, for the all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural networks and 0.1%, 1.75%, and 14.14%, respectively, for the Bayesian ML models. For the plug flow reactor data, the Bayesian ML models yield superior RMSE compared to the all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural networks when the measurement data are corrupted with Gaussian, auto‐correlated, or cross‐correlated noise.">

        <tr id="Estimating parameters of dynamic models from experimental data is a challenging, and often computationally-demanding task. It requires a large number of model simulations and objective function gradient computations, if gradient-based optimization is used. The gradient depends on derivatives of the state variables with respect to parameters, also called state sensitivities, which are expensive to compute. In many cases, steady-state computation is a part of model simulation, either due to steady-state data or an assumption that the system is at steady state at the initial time point. Various methods are available for steady-state and gradient computation. Yet, the most efficient pair of methods (one for steady states, one for gradients) for a particular model is often not clear. Moreover, depending on the model and the available data, some methods may not be applicable or sufficiently robust. In order to facilitate the selection of methods, we explore six method pairs for computing the steady state and sensitivities at steady state using six real-world problems. The method pairs involve numerical integration or Newton's method to compute the steady-state, and -- for both forward and adjoint sensitivity analysis -- numerical integration or a tailored method to compute the sensitivities at steady-state. Our evaluation shows that the two method pairs that combine numerical integration for the steady-state with a tailored method for the sensitivities at steady-state were the most robust, and amongst the most computationally-efficient. We also observed that while Newton's method for steady-state computation yields a substantial speedup compared to numerical integration, it may lead to a large number of simulation failures. Overall, our study provides a concise overview across current methods for computing sensitivities at steady state, guiding modelers to choose the right methods.">

        <tr id="Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.">

        <tr id="Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated strong capabilities of representing high-dimensional, complex functional relations, and hence have been widely used to characterize complex constitutive relations for various types of materials, such as polycrystals, polymers, etc. However, to construct a reliable NN-based constitutive model, a considerable amount of data, i.e. stress-strain states along different loading paths is needed, which can be expensive to collect. To address such challenge, we develop a hybrid finite element method (FEM) - NN optimization framework to learn complex hyperelastic constitutive relations from full-field data. The key advantage of this framework is that it can make use of the non-uniform displacement field due to the geometric inhomogeneities for training NN-based constitutive models. Since such data can provide many different stress-strain states in a single test, it can greatly reduce the number of experiments needed for the training of NNs. Besides, we adopt a mechanics-informed neural network (MINN) as our architecture to ensure that our NN-based models satisfy all necessary physical constraints by construction, such as objectivity, material symmetry, polyconvexity, etc. Such architecture is also key to the convergence of our optimization framework. We then use both synthetic and experimental data to test the performance of our proposed framework on various isotropic hyperelastic materials. Results show that our optimization framework can be used to train NN-based constitutive models for hyperelastic materials with high accuracy and efficiency using data generated from simple tests, which can also be easily adapted to characterize complex constitutive models for a broader range of materials.">

        <tr id="Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others.">

        <tr id="State estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems has long aimed to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The rapid evolution of various industries has amplified the demand for estimation frameworks that satisfy all these factors. This study introduces a neuromorphic approach for robust filtering of nonlinear dynamical systems: SNN-EMSIF (spiking neural network-extended modified sliding innovation filter). SNN-EMSIF combines the computational efficiency and scalability of SNNs with the robustness of EMSIF, an estimation framework designed for nonlinear systems with zero-mean Gaussian noise. Notably, the weight matrices are designed according to the system model, eliminating the need for a learning process. The framework's efficacy is evaluated through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing SNN-EMSIF with EKF and EMSIF. Additionally, it is compared with SNN-EKF in the presence of modeling uncertainties and neuron loss, using RMSEs as a metric. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of SNN-EMSIF. Further analysis of runtimes and spiking patterns reveals an impressive reduction of 85% in emitted spikes compared to possible spikes, highlighting the computational efficiency of SNN-EMSIF. This framework offers a promising solution for robust estimation in nonlinear dynamical systems, opening new avenues for efficient and reliable estimation in various industries that can benefit from neuromorphic computing.">

In such systems, patterns emerge from (local) interactions among self-propelled entities. While several well-understood governing equations for motion and interaction exist, they are difficult to fit to data due to the often large number of entities and missing correspondences between the observation times, which may also not be equidistant. To evade such confounding factors, we investigate collective behavior from a \textit{topological perspective}, but instead of summarizing entire observation sequences (as in prior work), we propose learning a latent dynamical model from topological features \textit{per time point}. The latter is then used to formulate a downstream regression task to predict the parametrization of some a priori specified governing equation. We implement this idea based on a latent ODE learned from vectorized (static) persistence diagrams and show that this modeling choice is justified by a combination of recent stability results for persistent homology. Various (ablation) experiments not only demonstrate the relevance of each individual model component, but provide compelling empirical evidence that our proposed model -- \textit{neural persistence dynamics} -- substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art across a diverse set of parameter regression tasks.">

This is combined with a physics-aware implicit solver that consists of a much coarser, discretized version of the original PDE, which provides the requisite information bottleneck for high-dimensional problems and enables generalization in out-of-distribution settings (e.g. different boundary conditions). We demonstrate its capability in the context of random heterogeneous materials where the input parameters represent the material microstructure. We extend the framework to multiscale problems and show that a surrogate can be learned for the effective (homogenized) solution without ever solving the reference problem.

The FCM uses simulated trajectory data to build a kernel-based model of the committor. The kernel function is constructed to emphasize low-dimensional subspaces which optimally describe the $A$ to $B$ transitions. The coefficients in the kernel model are determined using randomized linear algebra, leading to a runtime that scales linearly in the number of data points. In numerical experiments involving a triple-well potential and alanine dipeptide, the FCM yields higher accuracy and trains more quickly than a neural network with the same number of parameters.

        <tr id="Recurrent Neural Networks excel at predicting and generating complex high-dimensional temporal patterns. Due to their inherent nonlinear dynamics and memory, they can learn unbounded temporal dependencies from data. In a Machine Learning setting, the network's parameters are adapted during a training phase to match the requirements of a given task/problem increasing its computational capabilities. After the training, the network parameters are kept fixed to exploit the learned computations. The static parameters thereby render the network unadaptive to changing conditions, such as external or internal perturbation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how keeping parts of the network adaptive even after the training enhances its functionality and robustness. Here, we utilize the conceptor framework and conceptualize an adaptive control loop analyzing the network's behavior continuously and adjusting its time-varying internal representation to follow a desired target. We demonstrate how the added adaptivity of the network supports the computational functionality in three distinct tasks: interpolation of temporal patterns, stabilization against partial network degradation, and robustness against input distortion. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive networks in machine learning beyond training, enabling them to not only learn complex patterns but also dynamically adjust to changing environments, ultimately broadening their applicability.">

This poses the question of how to use these data to efficiently and effectively calibrate motion models. However, typical mathematical models often overlook the inherent aspects of data collection, such as the discreteness and the experimental noise of the measured locations. In this paper, we focus on velocity-jump models suitable to describe single-agent motion in one spatial dimension, characterised by successive Markovian transitions between a finite network of $n$ states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every other state. Since the problem of finding the exact distributions of discrete-time noisy data is generally intractable, we derive a series of approximations for the data distributions and compare them to in-silico data generated by the models using four example network structures. These comparisons suggest that the approximations are accurate given sufficiently infrequent state switching, or equivalently, a sufficiently high data collection frequency. Moreover, for infrequent switching, the PDFs comparisons highlight the importance of accounting for the correlation between subsequent measured locations, due to the likely permanence in the state visited in the previous measurement. The approximate distributions computed can be used for fast parameter inference and model selection between a range of velocity-jump models using single-agent tracking data.">

While observer-based methods have been shown to improve these estimates, they rely on accurate models of the system, which are challenging to obtain in complex operating environments. In this work, we overcome this issue by learning the unknown dynamics components using Gaussian process (GP) regression. By employing the learned model in a Bayesian filtering framework, we improve the estimation accuracy and additionally obtain an observer that explicitly considers local model uncertainty in the confidence measure of the state estimate. Furthermore, we derive guaranteed estimation error bounds, thus, facilitating the use in safety-critical applications.

        <tr id="We propose a novel finite element-based physics-informed operator learning framework that allows for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed framework employs a loss function inspired by the finite element method (FEM) with the implicit Euler time integration scheme. A transient thermal conduction problem is considered to benchmark the performance. The proposed operator learning framework takes a temperature field at the current time step as input and predicts a temperature field at the next time step. The Galerkin discretized weak formulation of the heat equation is employed to incorporate physics into the loss function, which is coined finite operator learning (FOL). Upon training, the networks successfully predict the temperature evolution over time for any initial temperature field at high accuracy compared to the FEM solution. The framework is also confirmed to be applicable to a heterogeneous thermal conductivity and arbitrary geometry. The advantages of FOL can be summarized as follows: First, the training is performed in an unsupervised manner, avoiding the need for a large data set prepared from costly simulations or experiments. Instead, random temperature patterns generated by the Gaussian random process and the Fourier series, combined with constant temperature fields, are used as training data to cover possible temperature cases. Second, shape functions and backward difference approximation are exploited for the domain discretization, resulting in a purely algebraic equation. This enhances training efficiency, as one avoids time-consuming automatic differentiation when optimizing weights and biases while accepting possible discretization errors. Finally, thanks to the interpolation power of FEM, any arbitrary geometry can be handled with FOL, which is crucial to addressing various engineering application scenarios.">

When there are time delays for components to sense and respond to feedback, delay differential equation (DDE) models are commonly used. This paper considers the problem of inferring unknown system parameters, including the time delays, from noisy and sparse experimental data observed from the system. We propose an extension of manifold-constrained Gaussian processes to conduct parameter inference for DDEs, whereas the time delay parameters have posed a challenge for existing methods that bypass numerical solvers. Our method uses a Bayesian framework to impose a Gaussian process model over the system trajectory, conditioned on the manifold constraint that satisfies the DDEs. For efficient computation, a linear interpolation scheme is developed to approximate the values of the time-delayed system outputs, along with corresponding theoretical error bounds on the approximated derivatives. Two simulation examples, based on Hutchinson's equation and the lac operon system, together with a real-world application using Ontario COVID-19 data, are used to illustrate the efficacy of our method.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we explore the interplay between Predictive Control and closed-loop optimality, spanning from Model Predictive Control to Data-Driven Predictive Control. Predictive Control in general relies on some form of prediction scheme on the real system trajectories. However, these predictions may not accurately capture the real system dynamics, for e.g., due to stochasticity, resulting in sub-optimal control policies. This lack of optimality is a critical issue in case of problems with economic objectives. We address this by providing sufficient conditions on the underlying prediction scheme such that a Predictive Controller can achieve closed-loop optimality. However, these conditions do not readily extend to Data-Driven Predictive Control. In this context of closed-loop optimality, we conclude that the factor distinguishing the approaches within Data-Driven Predictive Control is if they can be cast as a sequential decision-making process or not, rather than the dichotomy of model-based vs. model-free. Furthermore, we show that the conventional approach of improving the prediction accuracy from data may not guarantee optimality.">

Standard methods for data assimilation do not directly apply to such models. This is true in particular for ensemble Kalman filter (1, 2) methods, a common approach to such problems. This paper focuses on agent-based models (ABMs), a model type often used in biomedicine.

        <tr id="A functional nonlinear regression approach, incorporating time information in the covariates, is proposed for temporal strong correlated manifold map data sequence analysis. Specifically, the functional regression parameters are supported on a connected and compact two--point homogeneous space. The Generalized Least--Squares (GLS) parameter estimator is computed in the linearized model, having error term displaying manifold scale varying Long Range Dependence (LRD). The performance of the theoretical and plug--in nonlinear regression predictors is illustrated by simulations on sphere, in terms of the empirical mean of the computed spherical functional absolute errors. In the case where the second--order structure of the functional error term in the linearized model is unknown, its estimation is performed by minimum contrast in the functional spectral domain. The linear case is illustrated in the Supplementary Material, revealing the effect of the slow decay velocity in time of the trace norms of the covariance operator family of the regression LRD error term. The purely spatial statistical analysis of atmospheric pressure at high cloud bottom, and downward solar radiation flux in Alegria et al.

        <tr id="One of the core concepts in science, and something that happens intuitively in every-day dynamic systems modeling, is the combination of models or methods. Especially in dynamical systems modeling, often two or more structures are combined to obtain a more powerful or efficient architecture regarding a specific application (area). Further, even physical simulations are combined with machine learning architectures, to increase prediction accuracy or optimize the computational performance. In this work, we shortly discuss, which types of models are usually combined and propose a model interface that is capable of expressing a width variety of mixed algebraic, discrete and differential equation based models. Further, we examine different established, as well as new ways of combining these models from a system theoretical point of view and highlight two challenges - algebraic loops and local event affect functions in discontinuous models - that require a special approach. Finally, we propose a new wildcard topology, that is capable of describing the generic connection between two combined models in an easy to interpret fashion that can be learned as part of a gradient based optimization procedure. The contributions of this paper are highlighted at a proof of concept: Different connection topologies between two models are learned, interpreted and compared applying the proposed methodology and software implementation.">

Unfortunately, the problem is generally ill-posed due to the possible presence of unknown delays in the measurements. In this paper, we offer a solution of this problem by using a variational Bayes framework, where the uncertainty over the delays is marginalized in order to obtain conservative coupling estimates. To overcome the well-known overconfidence of classical variational methods, we use a hybrid-VI scheme where the (possibly flat or multimodal) posterior over the measurement parameters is estimated using a forward KL loss while the (nearly convex) conditional posterior over the couplings is estimated using the highly scalable gradient-based VI. In our ground-truth experiments, we show that the network provides reliable and conservative estimates of the couplings, greatly outperforming similar methods such as regression DCM.">

        <tr id="Neural networks are lately more and more often being used in the context of data-driven control, as an approximate model of the true system dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) adopts this practise leading to neural MPC strategies. This raises a question of whether the trained neural network has converged and generalized in a way that the learned model encapsulates an accurate approximation of the true dynamic model of the system, thus making it a reliable choice for model-based control, especially for disturbed and uncertain systems. To tackle that, we propose Dropout MPC, a novel sampling-based ensemble neural MPC algorithm that employs the Monte-Carlo dropout technique on the learned system model. The closed loop is based on an ensemble of predictive controllers, that are used simultaneously at each time-step for trajectory optimization. Each member of the ensemble influences the control input, based on a weighted voting scheme, thus by employing different realizations of the learned system dynamics, neural control becomes more reliable by design. An additional strength of the method is that it offers by design a way to estimate future uncertainty, leading to cautious control. While the method aims in general at uncertain systems with complex dynamics, where models derived from first principles are hard to infer, to showcase the application we utilize data gathered in the laboratory from a real mobile manipulator and employ the proposed algorithm for the navigation of the robot in simulation.">

We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points.

Translating these problems into numerical simulations and solving them using numerical schemes, e.g. the finite element method, is costly due to the demand of solving initial boundary-value problems at multiple scales. On the other hand, multiscale finite element computations are commended for their ability to integrate micro-structural properties into macroscopic computational analyses using homogenization techniques. Recently, neural operator-based surrogate models have shown trustworthy performance for solving a wide range of partial differential equations. In this work, we propose a hybrid method in which we utilize deep operator networks for surrogate modeling of the microscale physics. This allows us to embed the constitutive relations of the microscale into the model architecture and to predict microscale strains and stresses based on the prescribed macroscale strain inputs. Furthermore, numerical homogenization is carried out to obtain the macroscale quantities of interest. We apply the proposed approach to quasi-static problems of solid mechanics.

While mathematically equivalent, these forms are not computationally equivalent, making the exploration of different PDE formulations significant in computational physics. Thus, we propose different PDE forms based on KAN instead of MLP, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Informed Neural Network (KINN). We systematically compare MLP and KAN in various numerical examples of PDEs, including multi-scale, singularity, stress concentration, nonlinear hyperelasticity, heterogeneous, and complex geometry problems.

Many applications can be found on optimization over Stiefel manifold within the area of physics and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel idea by tackling the Stiefel manifold through an nonlinear eigen-approach by first using ADMM to split the problem into smooth optimization over manifold and convex non-smooth optimization, and then transforming the former into the form of nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency (NEPv) which is solved by self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, and the latter can be found to have an closed-form solution through proximal gradient.

This bottleneck limits the generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major advantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a Transformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable generalizability and scalability.">

        <tr id="In this work, we first show that the problem of parameter identification is often ill-conditioned and lacks the persistence of excitation required for the convergence of online learning schemes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the notion of optimal and greedy excitation sets which contain data points with sufficient richness to aid in the identification task. We then present the greedy excitation set-based recursive least squares algorithm to alleviate the problem of the lack of persistent excitation, and prove that the iterates generated by the proposed algorithm minimize an auxiliary weighted least squares cost function. When data points are generated from time-varying parameters, online estimators tend to underfit the true parameter trajectory, and their predictability deteriorates. To tackle this problem, we propose a memory resetting scheme leveraging change point detection techniques. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms via several numerical case studies to learn the (time-varying) parameters of networked epidemic dynamics, and compare it with results obtained using conventional approaches.">

        <tr id="This paper investigates the use of the Gaussian Process Convolution Model (GPCM) as an output only system identification tool for structural systems. The form of the model assumes a priori that the observed data arise as the result of a convolution between an unknown linear filter and an unobserved white noise process, where each of these are modelled as a GP. The GPCM infers both the linear time filter (which is the impulse response function, i.e. Green’s function, of the system) and driving white noise process in a Bayesian probabilistic fashion with an approximate variational posterior over both signals. It will be shown that although the model structure is intuitive and sensible priors are applied, the GPCM falls short in recovering the linear impulse response of interest response due to the problem of identifiability. This is an interesting result indicating that physically informed kernel structures alone are not enough to recover the true impulse response in similar non-parametric probabilistic models. Despite this, the avenue of research remains highly promising, and several ideas are proposed to improve the model as a system identification tool.">

Common examples include accounting for velocity fluctuations in a turbulent fluid flow model and cloud evolution in climate models. Most existing techniques for constructing coarse-grained models feature ill-defined parameters whose values are arbitrarily chosen (e.g., a window size), are narrow in their applicability (e.g., only applicable to time series or spatial data), or cannot readily incorporate physics information. Here, we introduce the concept of physics-guided Gaussian process regression as a machine-learning-based coarse-graining technique that is broadly applicable and amenable to input from known physics-based relationships. Using a pair of case studies derived from molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the attractive properties and superior performance of physics-guided Gaussian processes for coarse-graining relative to prevalent benchmarks. The key advantage of Gaussian-process-based coarse-graining is its ability to seamlessly integrate data-driven and physics-based information.">

        <tr id="The calibration of constitutive models from full-field data has recently gained increasing interest due to improvements in full-field measurement capabilities. In addition to the experimental characterization of novel materials, continuous structural health monitoring is another application that is of great interest. However, monitoring is usually associated with severe time constraints, difficult to meet with standard numerical approaches. Therefore, parametric physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for constitutive model calibration from full-field displacement data are investigated. In an offline stage, a parametric PINN can be trained to learn a parameterized solution of the underlying partial differential equation. In the subsequent online stage, the parametric PINN then acts as a surrogate for the parameters-to-state map in calibration. We test the proposed approach for the deterministic least-squares calibration of a linear elastic as well as a hyperelastic constitutive model from noisy synthetic displacement data. We further carry out Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference to quantify the uncertainty. A proper statistical evaluation of the results underlines the high accuracy of the deterministic calibration and that the estimated uncertainty is valid. Finally, we consider experimental data and show that the results are in good agreement with a Finite Element Method-based calibration. Due to the fast evaluation of PINNs, calibration can be performed in near real-time. This advantage is particularly evident in many-query applications such as Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference.">

JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss, runs at lightspeed, and drastically outperforms other baselines in practice. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals.

Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners.

        <tr id="Intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity is nowadays understood to play a critical role in disease progression and treatment failure. Accordingly, there has been increasing interest in the development of mathematical models capable of capturing its role in cancer cell adaptation. This can be systematically achieved by means of models comprising phenotype-structured nonlocal partial differential equations, tracking the evolution of the phenotypic density distribution of the cell population, which may be compared to gene and protein expression distributions obtained experimentally. Nevertheless, given the high analytical and computational cost of solving these models, much is to be gained from reducing them to systems of ordinary differential equations for the moments of the distribution. We propose a generalised method of model-reduction, relying on the use of a moment generating function, Taylor series expansion and truncation closure, to reduce a nonlocal reaction-advection-diffusion equation, with general phenotypic drift and proliferation rate functions, to a system of moment equations up to arbitrary order. Our method extends previous results in the literature, which we address via two examples, by removing any \textit{a priori} assumption on the shape of the distribution, and provides a flexible framework for mathematical modellers to account for the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer adaptive dynamics, in a simpler mathematical framework.">

Consequently, we seek to represent a learnable distribution of high-performance preconditioners from a low-dimensional subspace through a carefully-designed autoencoder, which is able to generate SPAI preconditioners for these systems.

        <tr id="In functional data analysis, replicate observations of a smooth functional process and its derivatives offer a unique opportunity to flexibly estimate continuous-time ordinary differential equation models. Ramsay (1996) first proposed to estimate a linear ordinary differential equation from functional data in a technique called Principal Differential Analysis, by formulating a functional regression in which the highest-order derivative of a function is modelled as a time-varying linear combination of its lower-order derivatives. Principal Differential Analysis was introduced as a technique for data reduction and representation, using solutions of the estimated differential equation as a basis to represent the functional data. In this work, we re-formulate PDA as a generative statistical model in which functional observations arise as solutions of a deterministic ODE that is forced by a smooth random error process. This viewpoint defines a flexible class of functional models based on differential equations and leads to an improved understanding and characterisation of the sources of variability in Principal Differential Analysis. It does, however, result in parameter estimates that can be heavily biased under the standard estimation approach of PDA. Therefore, we introduce an iterative bias-reduction algorithm that can be applied to improve parameter estimates. We also examine the utility of our approach when the form of the deterministic part of the differential equation is unknown and possibly non-linear, where Principal Differential Analysis is treated as an approximate model based on time-varying linearisation. We demonstrate our approach on simulated data from linear and non-linear differential equations and on real data from human movement biomechanics.

        <tr id="This paper considers the extraction of sparse solutions using the L1 minimization surrogate for two approximations of the nonlinear relation between parameters and features; in the first, nonline-arity is discarded altogether and in the second a quadratic relation is assumed. The associated algorithms are the well-known Basis Pursuit (BP) and the more recently introduced Quadratic Basis Pursuit (QBP). It is contended that measuring success by comparing the extracted solutions with the underlying truth is unnecessary, as all that’s needed from the extractor is to identify a sufficiently small parameter set to render the problem determined. Specifically, with p as the number of features, one is interest in the likelihood that the algorithm leads to Ωp ∩ Θ = Θ, where Θ = true set and Ωp = set of the largest p non-zero entries in the solution. When operating in this manner the disruption that nonlinearity brings into the BP solution derives only from the nonlinearity induced rotation of the right-hand side away from the span of the column partition of the Jacobian for the non-zero entries. From this perspective one expects performance to deteriorate only weakly with the extent of damage and this result is numerically con-firmed. It is found that although QBP has the quadratic premise as an advantage over BP, the perfor-mance in simulations, due to the difficulty in obtaining optimal values for the free parameters (and the fact that damage extent prediction was not relevant) proved somewhat poorer than BP.">

        <tr id="Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e.,"steering") the distribution of an ensemble system. In addition, in most of the existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Both linear and nonlinear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide numerical results to validate our theoretical developments. These include cases where the parameter distribution is uniform, Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and multi-modal, respectively.">

It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

        <tr id="Here we test the Stochastic Dynamic Operator (SDO) as a new framework for describing physiological signal dynamics relative to spiking or stimulus events. The SDO is a natural extension of existing spike-triggered averaging (STA), or stimulus-triggered averaging, methods currently used in neural analysis. It extends the classic STA to cover state-dependent and probabilistic responses where STA may fail. SDO methods are more sensitive and specific than the STA for identifying state-dependent relationships in simulated data. We have tested SDO analysis for interactions between electrophysiological recordings of spinal interneurons, single motor units, and aggregate muscle electromyograms (EMG) of major muscles in the spinal frog hindlimb. When predicting target signal behavior relative to spiking events, the SDO framework outperformed or matched classical spike-triggered averaging methods. SDO analysis permits more complicated spike-signal relationships to be captured, analyzed, and interpreted visually and intuitively. SDO methods can be applied at different scales of interest where spike-triggered averaging methods are currently employed, and beyond, from single neurons to gross motor behaviors. SDOs may be readily generated and analyzed using the provided SDO Analysis Toolkit. We anticipate this method will be broadly useful for describing dynamical signal behavior and uncovering state-dependent relationships of stochastic signals relative to discrete event times. SIGNIFICANCE Here the authors introduce new tools and demonstrate data analysis using a new probabilistic and state-dependent technique, which is an expansion and extension of the classical spike-triggered average, the Stochastic Dynamic Operator. Stochastic Dynamic Operator methods extend application into domains where classical spike triggered averages fail, capture more information on spike correlations, and match or outperform the spike-triggered average when generating predictions of signal amplitude based on spiking events. A data and code package toolkit for utilizing and interpreting Stochastic Dynamic Operator methods is provided together with example analyses. Both the method and the associated toolkit are thus expected to be broadly useful in research domains where the spike triggered average is currently used for analysis, and beyond.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems, e.g. in climate and engineering sciences, often necessitates solving partial differential equations. Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

Although several architectures exist for PINNs that work remarkably in practice, our theoretical understanding of their performances is somewhat limited. In this work, we study the behavior of a Bayesian PINN estimator of the solution of a PDE from $n$ independent noisy measurement of the solution. We focus on a class of equations that are linear in their parameters (with unknown coefficients $\theta_\star$). We show that when the partial differential equation admits a classical solution (say $u_\star$), differentiable to order $\beta$, the mean square error of the Bayesian posterior mean is at least of order $n^{-2\beta/(2\beta + d)}$. Furthermore, we establish a convergence rate of the linear coefficients of $\theta_\star$ depending on the order of the underlying differential operator. Last but not least, our theoretical results are validated through extensive simulations.">

The data-driven surrogate achieves similar accuracy and reduction in simulation time compared to a physics-based surrogate, without the constraint of requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying dynamic models.

        <tr id="Neural network-based approaches have recently shown significant promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering, especially in scenarios featuring complex domains or the incorporation of empirical data. One advantage of the neural network method for PDEs lies in its automatic differentiation (AD), which necessitates only the sample points themselves, unlike traditional finite difference (FD) approximations that require nearby local points to compute derivatives. In this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of AD in training neural networks. The concept of truncated entropy is introduced to characterize the training property. Specifically, through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses conducted on random feature models and two-layer neural networks, we discover that the defined truncated entropy serves as a reliable metric for quantifying the residual loss of random feature models and the training speed of neural networks for both AD and FD methods. Our experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that, from a training perspective, AD outperforms FD in solving partial differential equations.">

This paper distinguishes between two types of uncertainty within the posteriors of GP dynamical models: the well-documented mathematical uncertainty stemming from limited data and computational uncertainty arising from constrained computational capabilities, which has been largely overlooked in prior research. Our work demonstrates that computational uncertainty, quantified through a probabilistic approximation of the inverse covariance matrix in GP dynamical models, is essential for stable control under computational constraints. We show that incorporating computational uncertainty can prevent overestimating the region of attraction, a safe subset of the state space with asymptotic stability, thus improving system safety. Building on these insights, we propose an innovative controller design methodology that integrates computational uncertainty within a second-order cone programming framework. Simulations of canonical stable control tasks and experiments of quadrotor tracking exhibit the effectiveness of our method under computational constraints.">

        <tr id="We address parameter estimation in second-order stochastic differential equations (SDEs), prevalent in physics, biology, and ecology. Second-order SDE is converted to a first-order system by introducing an auxiliary velocity variable raising two main challenges. First, the system is hypoelliptic since the noise affects only the velocity, making the Euler-Maruyama estimator ill-conditioned. To overcome that, we propose an estimator based on the Strang splitting scheme. Second, since the velocity is rarely observed we adjust the estimator for partial observations. We present four estimators for complete and partial observations, using full likelihood or only velocity marginal likelihood. These estimators are intuitive, easy to implement, and computationally fast, and we prove their consistency and asymptotic normality. Our analysis demonstrates that using full likelihood with complete observations reduces the asymptotic variance of the diffusion estimator. With partial observations, the asymptotic variance increases due to information loss but remains unaffected by the likelihood choice. However, a numerical study on the Kramers oscillator reveals that using marginal likelihood for partial observations yields less biased estimators. We apply our approach to paleoclimate data from the Greenland ice core and fit it to the Kramers oscillator model, capturing transitions between metastable states reflecting observed climatic conditions during glacial eras.">

This article introduces a deep learning framework, the supersonic physics-constrained network (SPC), for the rapid solution of unsteady supersonic flow problems. SPC integrates deep convolutional neural networks with physics-constrained methods based on the Euler equation to derive a new loss function that can accurately calculate the flow fields by considering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow fields at the previous moment. Compared to purely data-driven methods, SPC significantly reduces the dependency on training data volume by incorporating physical constraints. Additionally, the training process of SPC is more stable than that of data-driven methods. Taking the classic supersonic forward step flow as an example, SPC can accurately calculate strong discontinuities in the flow fields, while reducing the data volume by approximately 60%. In the generalization test experiment for forward step flow and compression ramp flow, SPC also demonstrates good predictive accuracy and generalization capability under different geometric configurations and inflow conditions.">

The sensitivity matrix is used to solve the inverse problem as convex optimization, in which a global optimal solution can be found computationally efficiently.

The core idea of ElastoGen is converting the global differential operator, corresponding to the nonlinear elastodynamic equations, into iterative local convolution-like operations, which naturally fit modern neural networks. Each network module is specifically designed to support this goal rather than functioning as a black box. As a result, ElastoGen is exceptionally lightweight in terms of both training requirements and network scale.

It is the first time that such a prescribed‐time constrained tracking control problem is addressed for the PDE‐ODE coupled system considered in this article. Through rigorous theoretical proof, it is demonstrated that all the system states and control signals are bounded and sufficiently continuous by configuring appropriate design parameters.

        <tr id="The probabilistic characterization of non-Markovian responses to nonlinear dynamical systems under colored excitation is an important issue, arising in many applications. Extending the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, governing the first-order response probability density function (pdf), to this case is a complicated task calling for special treatment. In this work, a new pdf-evolution equation is derived for the response of nonlinear dynamical systems under additive colored Gaussian noise. The derivation is based on the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), transformed, by means of an extended version of the Novikov-Furutsu theorem, to an exact yet non-closed equation, involving averages over the history of the functional derivatives of the non-Markovian response with respect to the excitation. The latter are calculated exactly by means of the state-transition matrix of variational, time-varying systems. Subsequently, an approximation scheme is implemented, relying on a decomposition of the state-transition matrix in its instantaneous mean value and its fluctuation around it. By a current-time approximation to the latter, we obtain our final equation, in which the effect of the instantaneous mean value of the response is maintained, rendering it nonlinear and non-local in time. Numerical results for the response pdf are provided for a bistable Duffing oscillator, under Gaussian excitation. The pdfs obtained from the solution of the novel equation and a simpler small correlation time (SCT) pdf-evolution equation are compared to Monde Carlo (MC) simulations. The novel equation outperforms the SCT equation as the excitation correlation time increases, keeping good agreement with the MC simulations.">

        <tr id="Physical learning is an emerging paradigm in science and engineering whereby (meta)materials acquire desired macroscopic behaviors by exposure to examples. So far, it has been applied to static properties such as elastic moduli and self-assembled structures encoded in minima of an energy landscape. Here, we extend this paradigm to dynamic functionalities, such as motion and shape change, that are instead encoded in limit cycles or pathways of a dynamical system. We identify the two ingredients needed to learn time-dependent behaviors irrespective of experimental platforms: (i) learning rules with time delays and (ii) exposure to examples that break time-reversal symmetry during training. After providing a hands-on demonstration of these requirements using programmable LEGO toys, we turn to realistic particle-based simulations where the training rules are not programmed on a computer. Instead, we elucidate how they emerge from physico-chemical processes involving the causal propagation of fields, like in recent experiments on moving oil droplets with chemotactic signalling. Our trainable particles can self-assemble into structures that move or change shape on demand, either by retrieving the dynamic behavior previously seen during training, or by learning on the fly. This rich phenomenology is captured by a modified Hopfield spin model amenable to analytical treatment. The principles illustrated here provide a step towards von Neumann's dream of engineering synthetic living systems that adapt to the environment.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible. While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii). The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.">

In particular, we transform the affine coupling blocks of INNs into a symbolic framework, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable symbolic invertible architecture that allows for efficient gradient-based learning. The proposed ISR framework also relies on sparsity promoting regularization, allowing the discovery of concise and interpretable invertible expressions. We show that ISR can serve as a (symbolic) normalizing flow for density estimation tasks.

Specifically, we apply this technique to the 4-th order PDE of Euler-Bernoulli formulation to approximate beam displacement and identify structural parameters, including damping and elastic modulus. Our methodology incorporates partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network’s loss function during training, ensuring it adheres to physics-based constraints. This approach simplifies complex structural analysis, even when specific boundary conditions are unavailable. Importantly, our model reliably captures structural behavior without resorting to synthetic noise in data. This study represents a pioneering effort in utilizing PINNs for inverse problems in structural analysis, offering potential inspiration for other fields. The reliable characterization of damping, a typically challenging task, underscores the versatility of methodology. The strategy was initially assessed through numerical simulations utilizing data from a finite element solver and subsequently applied to experimental datasets. The presented methodology successfully identifies structural parameters using experimental data and validates its accuracy against reference data. This work opens new possibilities in engineering problem-solving, positioning Physics-Informed Neural Networks as valuable tools in addressing practical challenges in structural analysis.">

Such networks have a variety of hallmark properties: the outputs depend on the inputs via compressive nonlinearities such as cubic roots, and both the timescales of relaxation and the length-scales of signal propagation depend sensitively on the inputs as power laws, both diverging as the input to 0. The basic dynamical mechanism is that inputs to the network generate ongoing activity, which in turn controls how additional inputs or signals propagate spatially or attenuate in time. We present analytical solutions for the steady states when the network is forced with a single oscillation and when a background value creates a steady state of ongoing activity, and derive the relationships shaping the value of the temporal decay and spatial propagation length as a function of this background value.">

        <tr id="Machine learning is increasingly employed in engineering, with one of its primary applications being the construction of surrogate models to replace computationally expensive physical models for analysis and design, especially control co-design which integrates physical and control system design. In cases where generating labels for training through physical models is computationally intensive, label-free machine learning offers a viable alternative. However, surrogate models built from label-free machine learning typically have prediction errors, which can be characterized and quantified through epistemic uncertainty, representing model-form uncertainty. Moreover, when these surrogate models are used in optimization design for real-world applications, inherent random variables introduce aleatory uncertainty. This study introduces a robust design optimization method that addresses the intertwined epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. By optimizing both the average product performance and reducing uncertainty stemming from the coupled uncertainty, the method achieves improved robustness. A four-bar linkage mechanism design serves as a demonstration of this approach. The surrogate model for the design is constructed using label-free neural network, accommodating a system of physical equations. The error of the surrogate model is assessed through Gaussian Process regression, using existing training points and derivatives of the physical equations at these points. The design of the four-bar linkage aims to minimize both its average motion error and the variability of the error attributed to coupled uncertainty.">

Under different environmental perturbations, each biological system exhibits a unique, structured phenotypic response. This structure can be learned based on limited data and once learned, can constrain subsequent quantitative predictions. We demonstrate that SAR requires significantly fewer data comparing to other existing machine-learning methods to achieve a high prediction accuracy, first on simulated data, then on experimental data of various systems and input dimensions. We then show how a learned structure can guide effective design of new experiments.

Machine learning methods for solving the Allen-Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives through automatic differentiation, and the large system size required by the space-time approach. To overcome these limitations, we propose a separable neural network-based approximation of the phase field in a minimizing movement scheme to solve the aforementioned gradient flow problem. At each time step, the separable neural network is used to approximate the phase field in space through a low-rank tensor decomposition thereby accelerating the derivative calculations. The minimizing movement scheme naturally allows for the use of Gauss quadrature technique to compute the functional. A `$tanh$' transformation is applied on the neural network-predicted phase field to strictly bounds the solutions within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, a theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that bounding the solution through this transformation is the key to effectively model sharp interfaces through separable neural network. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for phase separation problems and is an order of magnitude faster than the finite element method.">

For the assessment of their stress response, commonly cyclic tensile tests are conducted. An important but subtle parameter in this procedure is the martensite evolution. In scenarios where conducting thermal experiments is impractical, inverse modeling from cyclic tests serves as a viable alternative. However, employing constitutive models in this process presents distinct challenges, such as parameter identification and calibration, or numerical stability issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven method based on a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) to estimate the martensite evolution. Constraint with a stress equation, the network requires only strain–stress data for training and provides stress responses in addition to the martensite evolution. From the training data, the network learns to consider the effects included in the response. The DeepONet can be coupled with experiments to provide online estimates from noisy sensor-based strain inputs, while remaining numerically stable. Moreover, this approach avoids the need for separate parameter identification or calibration. This paper details this method and evaluates its performance through experiments conducted on superelastic SMA wires. Furthermore, as an alternative approach, training using a constitutive model is provided.">

The empirical distribution of the model weights converges to a deterministic measure governed by a McKean-Vlasov nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). Under L2 regularization, this PDE reduces to a closed set of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), reflecting the evolution of the model performance during the training process. We analyze the fixed point locations and their stability of the ODEs unveiling several interesting findings. First, only the hidden variable's second moment affects feature learnability at the state with uninformative initialization. Second, higher moments influence the probability of feature selection by controlling the attraction region, rather than affecting local stability. Finally, independent noises added in the data argumentation degrade performance but negatively correlated noise can reduces the variance of gradient estimation yielding better performance. Despite of the simplicity of the analyzed model, it exhibits a rich phenomena of training dynamics, paving a way to understand more complex mechanism behind practical large models.">

Using sequence models such as gated recurrent units and transformers, we extract the necessary information and relationships from the static frequency vector to predict the process parameters for the short-term dynamics of frequency following a Gaussian process. Both for the evaluation measures (e.g. MSE, MAE, RMSE) for point estimators and for the measures for probalistic evaluations (e.g. Negative Log Likelihood Score, CPRS and Energy Score), our prediction performance is comparable to state-of-the-art models and outperforms various purely data-driven models such as daily profiles and k-nearest-neighbour profiles.

Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the 'explicit' dynamics of the object with an 'implicit' flow on free energy gradients - a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.">

Their main benefit is better accuracy with fewer training points compared to standard neural networks. These attributes are particularly desirable in the field of computer-aided design, where there is often the need to replace computationally expensive, physics-based models with fast running approximations, known as surrogate models or meta-models. Since a surrogate emulates the original model accurately in near-real time, it yields a speed benefit that can be used to carry out orders of magnitude more function calls quickly. However, in the special case of gradient-enhanced methods, there is the additional value proposition that partial derivatives are accurate, which is a critical property for one important use-case: surrogate-based optimization. This work derives the complete theory and exemplifies its superiority over standard neural nets for surrogate-based optimization.">

In the quantum realm, such approach paves the way to a novel approach to solve the Schroedinger equation for non-integrable systems. By following an unsupervised learning approach, we apply the PINNs to the anharmonic oscillator in which an interaction term proportional to the fourth power of the position coordinate is present. We compute the eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions while varying the weight of the quartic interaction. We bridge our solutions to the regime where both the perturbative and the strong coupling theory work, including the pure quartic oscillator.

        <tr id="A persistent challenge in tasks involving large-scale dynamical systems, such as state estimation and error reduction, revolves around processing the collected measurements. Frequently, these data suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased computational demands in data processing methodologies. Recent scholarly investigations have underscored the utility of delineating collective states and dynamics via moment-based representations. These representations serve as a form of sufficient statistics for encapsulating collective characteristics, while simultaneously permitting the retrieval of individual data points. In this paper, we reshape the Kalman filter methodology, aiming its application in the moment domain of an ensemble system and developing the basis for moment ensemble noise filtering. The moment system is defined with respect to the normalized Legendre polynomials, and it is shown that its orthogonal basis structure introduces unique benefits for the application of Kalman filter for both i.i.d. and universal Gaussian disturbances. The proposed method thrives from the reduction in problem dimension, which is unbounded within the state-space representation, and can achieve significantly smaller values when converted to the truncated moment-space. Furthermore, the robustness of moment data toward outliers and localized inaccuracies is an additional positive aspect of this approach. The methodology is applied for an ensemble of harmonic oscillators and units following aircraft dynamics, with results showcasing a reduction in both cumulative absolute error and covariance with reduced calculation cost due to the realization of operations within the moment framework conceived.">

        <tr id="Learning from expert demonstrations to flexibly program an autonomous system with complex behaviors or to predict an agent's behavior is a powerful tool, especially in collaborative control settings. A common method to solve this problem is inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), where the observed agent, e.g., a human demonstrator, is assumed to behave according to the optimization of an intrinsic cost function that reflects its intent and informs its control actions. While the framework is expressive, it is also computationally demanding and generally lacks convergence guarantees. We therefore propose a novel, stability-certified IRL approach by reformulating the cost function inference problem to learning control Lyapunov functions (CLF) from demonstrations data. By additionally exploiting closed-form expressions for associated control policies, we are able to efficiently search the space of CLFs by observing the attractor landscape of the induced dynamics. For the construction of the inverse optimal CLFs, we use a Sum of Squares and formulate a convex optimization problem. We present a theoretical analysis of the optimality properties provided by the CLF and evaluate our approach using both simulated and real-world data.">

        <tr id="In general, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has a wide range of applications, aiming to minimize symmetric loss function (mean square error) and improve the accuracy and efficiency of state estimation. As the nonlinear model complexity increases, rounding errors gradually amplify, leading to performance degradation. After multiple iterations, divergence may occur. The traditional extended Kalman filter cannot accurately estimate the nonlinear model, and these errors still have an impact on the accuracy. To improve the filtering performance of the extended Kalman filter (EKF), this paper proposes a new extended Kalman filter (REKF) method that utilizes the statistical properties of the rounding error to enhance the estimation accuracy. After establishing the state model and measurement model, the residual term is used to replace the higher-order term in the Taylor expansion, and the least squares method is applied to identify the residual term step by step. Then, the iterative process of updating the extended Kalman filter is carried out. Within the Kalman filter framework, a higher-order rounding error-based extended Kalman filter (REKF) is designed for the joint estimation of rounding error and random variables, and the solution method for the rounding error is considered for the multilevel approximation of the original function. Through numerical simulations on a general nonlinear model, the higher-order rounding error-based extended Kalman filter (REKF) achieves better estimation results than the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and improves the filtering accuracy by utilizing the higher-order rounding error information, which also proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.">

Here, hinging on ideas from group representation theory, we define trainable layers whose algebraic structure is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the lattice cell. Our method naturally allows for efficient implementations, both in terms of memory usage and computational costs, supporting scalable training/testing for lattices in two spatial dimensions and higher, as the size of symmetry group grows. We validate and test our approach considering 2D and 3D flowing dynamics, both in laminar and turbulent regimes. We compare with group averaged-based symmetric networks and with plain, non-symmetric, networks, showing how our approach unlocks the (a-posteriori) accuracy and training stability of the former models, and the train/inference speed of the latter networks (LENNs are about one order of magnitude faster than group-averaged networks in 3D).

We develop an algorithm for determining a sparse actuator schedule that ensures the existence of a sparse control input sequence, following the schedule, that takes the system from any given initial state to any desired final state. Since such an actuator schedule is not unique, we look for a schedule that minimizes the energy of sparse inputs. For this, we optimize the trace of the inverse of the resulting controllability Gramian, which is an approximate measure of the average energy of the inputs. We present a greedy algorithm along with its theoretical guarantees. Finally, we empirically show that our greedy algorithm ensures the controllability of the linear system with a small number of active actuators per time step without a significant average energy expenditure compared to the fully actuated system.">

However, PINNs are not well suited for solving PDEs with multiscale features, particularly suffering from slow convergence and poor accuracy. To address this limitation of PINNs, this article proposes physics-informed cell representations for resolving multiscale Poisson problems using a model architecture consisting of multilevel multiresolution grids coupled with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The grid parameters (i.e., the level-dependent feature vectors) and the MLP parameters (i.e., the weights and biases) are determined using gradient-descent based optimization. The variational (weak) form based loss function accelerates computation by allowing the linear interpolation of feature vectors within grid cells. This cell-based MLP model also facilitates the use of a decoupled training scheme for Dirichlet boundary conditions and a parameter-sharing scheme for periodic boundary conditions, delivering superior accuracy compared to conventional PINNs. Furthermore, the numerical examples highlight improved speed and accuracy in solving PDEs with nonlinear or high-frequency boundary conditions and provide insights into hyperparameter selection. In essence, by cell-based MLP model along with the parallel tiny-cuda-nn library, our implementation improves convergence speed and numerical accuracy.">

        <tr id="Digital twin (DT) technology integrates the physical world with its digitalized counterpart and suggests significant potential for intelligent transportation system development, such as CAV test and development. In the foreseeable near future, human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will continue to predominate, and a digital replica of the transportation system should reflect their behavioral patterns for enhanced simulation realism purposes. As such, stochastic driver behavior and vehicle dynamics should be respected. The observations serving as DT input, often captured at discrete moments (e.g., the roadside units and cameras are only installed at certain locations), result in discontinuously captured vehicle trajectories. The stochastic generation of behaviorally consistent vehicle trajectories conditional on such incomplete information becomes important. Current conditional approaches include modified Brownian bridge (MBB) and guided proposal bridge (GPB) may not be able to output realistic results. To fill this gap, we propose conditional generation methods of behaviorally consistent trajectories, employing the stochastic bridge approach for the first time. First, a vehicular dynamics model that encapsulates the stochasticity of the human–vehicle system is employed, and then we prove that MBB and GPB fail to generate satisfactory results. Then, a forward–backward method is proposed based on the backward Markov process, which takes the vehicular dynamics model as behavioral input. The proposed method is validated against real-world data and mainstream simulation platforms, showing that the forward–backward generation method provides consistent and realistic results. Its time consumption has also been proven to be promising for real-time DT applications.">

        <tr id="Functional data analysis (FDA) finds widespread application across various fields, due to data being recorded continuously over a time interval or at several discrete points. Since the data is not observed at every point but rather across a dense grid, smoothing techniques are often employed to convert the observed data into functions. In this work, we propose a novel Bayesian approach for selecting basis functions for smoothing one or multiple curves simultaneously. Our method differentiates from other Bayesian approaches in two key ways: (i) by accounting for correlated errors and (ii) by developing a variational EM algorithm instead of a Gibbs sampler. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method effectively identifies the true underlying structure of the data across various scenarios and it is applicable to different types of functional data. Our variational EM algorithm not only recovers the basis coefficients and the correct set of basis functions but also estimates the existing within-curve correlation. When applied to the motorcycle dataset, our method demonstrates comparable, and in some cases superior, performance in terms of adjusted $R^2$ compared to other techniques such as regression splines, Bayesian LASSO and LASSO. Additionally, when assuming independence among observations within a curve, our method, utilizing only a variational Bayes algorithm, is in the order of thousands faster than a Gibbs sampler on average. Our proposed method is implemented in R and codes are available at https://github.com/acarolcruz/VB-Bases-Selection.">

        <tr id="Duality between estimation and control is a foundational concept in Control Theory. Most students learn about the elementary duality -- between observability and controllability -- in their first graduate course in linear systems theory. Therefore, it comes as a surprise that for a more general class of nonlinear stochastic systems (hidden Markov models or HMMs), duality is incomplete. Our objective in writing this article is two-fold: (i) To describe the difficulty in extending duality to HMMs; and (ii) To discuss its recent resolution by the authors. A key message is that the main difficulty in extending duality comes from time reversal in going from estimation to control. The reason for time reversal is explained with the aid of the familiar linear deterministic and linear Gaussian models. The explanation is used to motivate the difference between the linear and the nonlinear models. Once the difference is understood, duality for HMMs is described based on our recent work. The article also includes a comparison and discussion of the different types of duality considered in literature.">

        <tr id="With the current growing availability of datasets coming from multiple sources and domains, systems onboard our military assets have an immediate need of being functional in multiple domains, handling large amounts of data, and implementing fast and appropriate analyses for these datasets. However, onboard systems often have very limited computational resources upon which to process these tasks. Generalized additive models (GAMs), which are statistical model that are better able to account for non-linear relationships between independent and dependent variables, have been shown in multiple application areas to yield more accurate estimates than models that only assume linear relationships. GAMs require fitting smooth functions of independent variables, and potentially interactions between two or more independent variables with tensor products, commonly using penalized basis splines (P-splines). However, when trying to make predictions for previously unseen feature vectors and without the benefit of significant computing power and necessary software packages, computing the necessary P-spline basis values in order to make predictions becomes computationally intractable. We show that approximating the smooth functions of a trained GAM with cubic splines yields very good estimates that result in minimal loss of accurate compared to the original trained GAM model while significantly decreasing computational cost. These two benefits have resulted in our method being adopted by a primary contractor handling high-fidelity analyses. We will show our implementation results on simulated and real datasets, discuss our findings, and conclude with remarks on future work.">

        <tr id="This article develops mathematical formalisms and provides numerical methods for studying the evolution of measures in nonsmooth dynamical systems using the continuity equation. The nonsmooth dynamical system is described by an evolution variational inequality and we derive the continuity equation associated with this system class using three different formalisms. The first formalism consists of using the {superposition principle} to describe the continuity equation for a measure that disintegrates into a probability measure supported on the set of vector fields and another measure representing the distribution of system trajectories at each time instant. The second formalism is based on the regularization of the nonsmooth vector field and describing the measure as the limit of a sequence of measures associated with the regularization parameter. In doing so, we obtain quantitative bounds on the Wasserstein metric between measure solutions of the regularized vector field and the limiting measure associated with the nonsmooth vector field. The third formalism uses a time-stepping algorithm to model a time-discretized evolution of the measures and show that the absolutely continuous trajectories associated with the continuity equation are recovered in the limit as the sampling time goes to zero. We also validate each formalism with numerical examples. For the first formalism, we use polynomial optimization techniques and the moment-SOS hierarchy to obtain approximate moments of the measures. For the second formalism, we illustrate the bounds on the Wasserstein metric for an academic example for which the closed-form expression of the Wasserstein metric can be calculated. For the third formalism, we illustrate the time-stepping based algorithm for measure evolution on an example that shows the effect of the concentration of measures.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a novel Wasserstein distributionally robust control and state estimation algorithm for partially observable linear stochastic systems, where the probability distributions of disturbances and measurement noises are unknown. Our method consists of the control and state estimation phases to handle distributional ambiguities of system disturbances and measurement noises, respectively. Leveraging tools from modern distributionally robust optimization, we consider an approximation of the control problem with an arbitrary nominal distribution and derive its closed-form optimal solution. We show that the separation principle holds, thereby allowing the state estimator to be designed separately. A novel distributionally robust Kalman filter is then proposed as an optimal solution to the state estimation problem with Gaussian nominal distributions. Our key contribution is the combination of distributionally robust control and state estimation into a unified algorithm. This is achieved by formulating a tractable semidefinite programming problem that iteratively determines the worst-case covariance matrices of all uncertainties, leading to a scalable and efficient algorithm. Our method is also shown to enjoy a guaranteed cost property as well as a probabilistic out-of-sample performance guarantee. The results of our numerical experiments demonstrate the performance and computational efficiency of the proposed method.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models excel at creating visually-convincing images, but they often struggle to meet subtle constraints inherent in the training data. Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model not only improves its distribution-matching accuracy but also makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are inflexible with different types of constraints. Recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs) in an unconstrained space defined by a mirror map and to impose the constraint with an inverse mirror map, but analytical mirror maps are challenging to derive for complex constraints. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that pushes data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.">

        <tr id="Our current understanding of fluctuations of dynamical (time-integrated) observables in non- Markovian processes is still very limited. A major obstacle is the lack of an appropriate theoretical framework to evaluate the associated large deviation functions. In this paper we bypass this difficulty in the case of linear diffusions with time delay by using a Markovian embedding procedure that introduces an infinite set of coupled differential equations. We then show that the generating functions of current-type observables can be computed at arbitrary finite time by solving matrix Riccati differential equations (RDEs) somewhat similar to those encountered in optimal control and filtering problems. By exploring in detail the properties of these RDEs and of the corresponding continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs), we identify the generic fixed point towards which the solutions converge in the long-time limit. This allows us to derive the explicit expressions of the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), of the pre-exponential factors, and of the effective (or driven) process that describes how fluctuations are created dynamically. Finally, we describe the special behavior occurring at the limits of the domain of existence of the SCGF, in connection with fluctuation relations for the heat and the entropy production.">

        <tr id="Parameter identifiability is an important aspect of parameter estimation of dynamic system modelling. Several methods exist to determine identifiability of parameter sets using the model definition and analysis of experimental data. There is also the possibility of some parameters being independently unidentifiable but forming identifiable parameter combinations. These identifiable parameter combinations are useful in model reparameterisation to estimate parameters experimentally. Multiple numerical and algebraic methods exist to detect identifiable parameter combinations of dynamic system models represented as ordinary differential equations (ODE). Local identifiability analysis of hybrid system models are available in the literature. However, methods for structural identifiability analysis and identifiable combination detection for hybrid systems are not explored. Here, we have developed a parameter identifiable combination detection method for non-linear hybrid systems along with ODE systems using an SMT based parameter space exploration method. For higher dimensional systems and larger parameter space, SMT based approaches may easily become computationally intractable. This problem has been mitigated to a large extent by heuristically limiting the parameter space to be explored, using Gaussian process regression and gradient based approaches. The developed method has been demonstrated for some simple hybrid models, biochemical models of ODE systems and non-linear hybrid systems.">

However, despite their significant success in various fields, it remains unclear in many aspects how to effectively train PINNs if the solutions of PDEs exhibit stiff behaviors or high frequencies. In this paper, we propose a new method for training PINNs using variable-scaling techniques. This method is simple and it can be applied to a wide range of problems including PDEs with rapidly-varying solutions. Throughout various numerical experiments, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for these problems and confirm that it can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of PINNs. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we will provide theoretical evidence for this phenomenon and show that our methods can indeed improve the performance of PINNs.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

        <tr id="Subspace identification methods (SIMs) have proven very powerful for estimating linear state-space models. To overcome the deficiencies of classical SIMs, a significant number of algorithms has appeared over the last two decades, where most of them involve a common intermediate step, that is to estimate the range space of the extended observability matrix. In this contribution, an optimized version of the parallel and parsimonious SIM (PARSIM), PARSIM\textsubscript{opt}, is proposed by using weighted least-squares. It not only inherits all the benefits of PARSIM but also attains the best linear unbiased estimator for the above intermediate step. Furthermore, inspired by SIMs based on the predictor form, consistent estimates of the optimal weighting matrix for weighted least-squares are derived. Essential similarities, differences and simulated comparisons of some key SIMs related to our method are also presented.">

        <tr id="Dynamic models generating time‐dependent model predictions are typically associated with high‐dimensional input spaces and high‐dimensional output spaces, in particular if time is discretized. It is computationally prohibitive to apply traditional global sensitivity analysis (SA) separately on each time output, as is common in the literature on multivariate SA. As an alternative, we propose a novel method for efficient global SA of dynamic models with high‐dimensional inputs by combining a new polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)‐driven partial least squares (PLS) algorithm with the analysis of variance. PLS is used to simultaneously reduce the dimensionality of the input and output variables spaces, by identifying the input and output latent variables that account for most of their joint variability. PCE is incorporated into the PLS algorithm to capture the non‐linear behavior of the physical system. We derive the sensitivity indices associated with each output latent variable, based on which we propose generalized sensitivity indices that synthesize the influence of each input on the variance of entire output time series. All sensitivities can be computed analytically by post‐processing the coefficients of the PLS‐PCE representation. Hence, the computational cost of global SA for dynamic models essentially reduces to the cost for estimating these coefficients. We numerically compare the proposed method with existing methods by several dynamic models with high‐dimensional inputs. The results show that the PLS‐PCE method can obtain accurate sensitivity indices at low computational cost, even for models with strong interaction among the inputs.">

In this paper, we derive a PAC bound for stable continuous-time linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems.

        <tr id="Machine learning has been proposed as an alternative to theoretical modeling when dealing with complex problems in biological physics. However, in this perspective, we argue that a more successful approach is a proper combination of these two methodologies. We discuss how ideas coming from physical modeling neuronal processing led to early formulations of computational neural networks, e.g., Hopfield networks. We then show how modern learning approaches like Potts models, Boltzmann machines, and the transformer architecture are related to each other, specifically, through a shared energy representation. We summarize recent efforts to establish these connections and provide examples on how each of these formulations integrating physical modeling and machine learning have been successful in tackling recent problems in biomolecular structure, dynamics, function, evolution, and design. Instances include protein structure prediction; improvement in computational complexity and accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations; better inference of the effects of mutations in proteins leading to improved evolutionary modeling and finally how machine learning is revolutionizing protein engineering and design. Going beyond naturally existing protein sequences, a connection to protein design is discussed where synthetic sequences are able to fold to naturally occurring motifs driven by a model rooted in physical principles. We show that this model is "learnable" and propose its future use in the generation of unique sequences that can fold into a target structure.">

        <tr id="Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems to perform complex tasks in a cost-effective manner when compared to typical neural networks. Many recent advancements in reservoir computing, in particular quantum reservoir computing, make use of reservoirs that are inherently stochastic. However, the theoretical justification for using these systems has not yet been well established. In this paper, we investigate the universality of stochastic reservoir computers, in which we use a stochastic system for reservoir computing using the probabilities of each reservoir state as the readout instead of the states themselves. In stochastic reservoir computing, the number of distinct states of the entire reservoir computer can potentially scale exponentially with the size of the reservoir hardware, offering the advantage of compact device size. We prove that classes of stochastic echo state networks, and therefore the class of all stochastic reservoir computers, are universal approximating classes. We also investigate the performance of two practical examples of stochastic reservoir computers in classification and chaotic time series prediction. While shot noise is a limiting factor in the performance of stochastic reservoir computing, we show significantly improved performance compared to a deterministic reservoir computer with similar hardware in cases where the effects of noise are small.">

We argue that residual is, at best, an indirect measure of the error of approximate solution and propose to train with error majorant instead. Since error majorant provides a direct upper bound on error, one can reliably estimate how close PiNN is to the exact solution and stop the optimization process when the desired accuracy is reached. We call loss function associated with error majorant $\textbf{Astral}$: neur$\textbf{A}$l a po$\textbf{ST}$erio$\textbf{RI}$ function$\textbf{A}$l Loss. To compare Astral and residual loss functions, we illustrate how error majorants can be derived for various PDEs and conduct experiments with diffusion equations (including anisotropic and in the L-shaped domain), convection-diffusion equation, temporal discretization of Maxwell's equation, and magnetostatics problem. The results indicate that Astral loss is competitive to the residual loss, typically leading to faster convergence and lower error (e.g., for Maxwell's equations, we observe an order of magnitude better relative error and training time). We also report that the error estimate obtained with Astral loss is usually tight enough to be informative, e.g., for a highly anisotropic equation, on average, Astral overestimates error by a factor of $1.5$, and for convection-diffusion by a factor of $1.7$.">

Prevalent examples include a) linear models where the signal lies in a low-dimensional subspace; b) sparse models where the signal can be represented by only a few coefficients under a suitable basis; and c) a large family of neural network generative models. In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets in orthogonal or unitary representations of groups: with a suitable dimension bound, a generic translate of any semi-algebraic set is transverse to the orbits of the group action. This, in turn, implies that if a signal lies in a low-dimensional semi-algebraic set, then it can be recovered uniquely from measurements that separate orbits. As an application, we consider the implications of the transversality theorem to the problem of recovering signals that are translated by random group actions from their second moment. As a special case, we discuss cryo-EM: a leading technology to constitute the spatial structure of biological molecules, which serves as our prime motivation. In particular, we derive explicit bounds for recovering a molecular structure from the second moment under a semi-algebraic prior and deduce information-theoretic implications. We also obtain information-theoretic bounds for three additional applications: factoring Gram matrices, multi-reference alignment, and phase retrieval. Finally, we deduce bounds for designing permutation invariant separators in machine learning.">

        <tr id="We consider estimators obtained by iterates of the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm applied to the normal equation of prototypical statistical inverse problems. Stopping the CG algorithm early induces regularisation, and optimal convergence rates of prediction and reconstruction error are established in wide generality for an ideal oracle stopping time. Based on this insight, a fully data-driven early stopping rule $\tau$ is constructed, which also attains optimal rates, provided the error in estimating the noise level is not dominant. The error analysis of CG under statistical noise is subtle due to its nonlinear dependence on the observations. We provide an explicit error decomposition into two terms, which shares important properties of the classical bias-variance decomposition. Together with a continuous interpolation between CG iterates, this paves the way for a comprehensive error analysis of early stopping. In particular, a general oracle-type inequality is proved for the prediction error at $\tau$. For bounding the reconstruction error, a more refined probabilistic analysis, based on concentration of self-normalised Gaussian processes, is developed. The methodology also provides some new insights into early stopping for CG in deterministic inverse problems. A numerical study for standard examples shows good results in practice for early stopping at $\tau$.">

        <tr id="The stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model considered here is a two-dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential equation with additive degenerate noise, whose first component, the only one observed, describes the membrane voltage evolution of a single neuron. Due to its low dimensionality, its analytical and numerical tractability, and its neuronal interpretation, it has been used as a case study to test the performance of different statistical methods in estimating the underlying model parameters. Existing methods, however, often require complete observations, non-degeneracy of the noise or a complex architecture (e.g., to estimate the transition density of the process,"recovering"the unobserved second component), and they may not (satisfactorily) estimate all model parameters simultaneously. Moreover, these studies lack real data applications for the stochastic FHN model. Here, we tackle all challenges (non-globally Lipschitz drift, non-explicit solution, lack of available transition density, degeneracy of the noise, and partial observations) via an intuitive and easy-to-implement sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm. The proposed method relies on a recent computationally efficient and structure-preserving numerical splitting scheme for synthetic data generation, and on summary statistics exploiting the structural properties of the process. We succeed in estimating all model parameters from simulated data and, more remarkably, real action potential data of rats. The presented novel real-data fit may broaden the scope and credibility of this classic and widely used neuronal model.">

        <tr id="Homeostasis is concerned with regulatory mechanisms, present in biological systems, where some specific variable is kept close to a set value as some external disturbance affects the system. Mathematically, the notion of homeostasis can be formalized in terms of an input-output function that maps the parameter representing the external disturbance to the output variable that must be kept within a fairly narrow range. This observation inspired the introduction of the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis, namely, the derivative of the input-output function is zero at an isolated point. This point of view allows for the application of methods from singularity theory to characterize infinitesimal homeostasis points (i.e. critical points of the input-output function). In this paper we review the infinitesimal approach to the study of homeostasis in input-output networks. An input-output network is a network with two distinguished nodes `input' and `output', and the dynamics of the network determines the corresponding input-output function of the system. This class of dynamical systems provides an appropriate framework to study homeostasis and several important biological systems can be formulated in this context. Moreover, this approach, coupled to graph-theoretic ideas from combinatorial matrix theory, provides a systematic way for classifying different types of homeostasis (homeostatic mechanisms) in input-output networks, in terms of the network topology. In turn, this leads to new mathematical concepts, such as, homeostasis subnetworks, homeostasis patterns, homeostasis mode interaction. We illustrate the usefulness of this theory with several biological examples: biochemical networks, chemical reaction networks (CRN), gene regulatory networks (GRN), Intracellular metal ion regulation and so on.">

Model-driven estimation of EC is a powerful approach that requires estimating global and local parameters of a generative model of neural activity. Insights gathered through this process can be used in various applications, such as studying neurodevelopmental disorders. However, accurately determining EC through generative models remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of brain dynamics and the inherent noise in neural recordings, e.g., in electroencephalography (EEG). Current model-driven methods to study EC are computationally complex and cannot scale to all brain regions as required by whole-brain analyses. To facilitate EC assessment, an inference algorithm must exhibit reliable prediction of parameters in the presence of noise. Further, the relationship between the model parameters and the neural recordings must be learnable. To progress toward these objectives, we benchmarked the performance of a Bi-LSTM model for parameter inference from the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) simulated EEG under various noise conditions. Additionally, our study explores how the JR-NMM reacts to changes in key biological parameters (i.e., sensitivity analysis) like synaptic gains and time constants, a crucial step in understanding the connection between neural mechanisms and observed brain activity. Our results indicate that we can predict the local JR-NMM parameters from EEG, supporting the feasibility of our deep-learning-based inference approach.

With given correspondence between the spaces, SyncOT minimizes the aggregated cost of the dynamics induced across all considered spaces. The problem is discretized into a finite-dimensional convex problem using a staggered grid. Primal-dual algorithm-based approaches are then developed to solve the discretized problem.

This enhancement allows to derive new simple optimality conditions that provide insights into the possibility to add and/or move multiple impulsive manoeuvres and improve the overall mass budget. This proves especially valuable in scenarios where a baseline trajectory arc is, for example, limited to a single impulse-an instance where traditional primer vector developments become singular and hinder conclusive outcomes. In demonstrating the practical application of the surrogate primer vector, we examine a specific case involving the four-body dynamics of a spacecraft within an Earth-Moon-Sun system. The system is characterized by the high-precision and differentiable VSOP2013 and ELP2000 ephemerides models. The focal point of our investigation is a reference trajectory representing a return from Mars, utilizing the weak stability boundary (WSB) of the Sun-Earth-Moon system. The trajectory incorporates two consecutive lunar flybys to insert the spacecraft into a lunar distant retrograde orbit (DRO). Conventionally, this trajectory necessitates a single maneuver at the DRO injection point.">

        <tr id="Many problems in Physics and Chemistry are formulated as the minimization of a functional. Therefore, methods for solving these problems typically require differentiating maps whose input and/or output are functions -- commonly referred to as variational differentiation. Such maps are not addressed at the mathematical level by the chain rule, which underlies modern symbolic and algorithmic differentiation (AD) systems. Although there are algorithmic solutions such as tracing and reverse accumulation, they do not provide human readability and introduce strict programming constraints that bottleneck performance, especially in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. In this manuscript, we propose a new computer theoretic model of differentiation by combining the pullback of the $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{C}$ combinators from the combinatory logic. Unlike frameworks based on the chain rule, this model differentiates a minimal complete basis for the space of computable functions. Consequently, the model is capable of analytic backpropagation and variational differentiation while supporting complex numbers. To demonstrate the generality of this approach we build a system named CombDiff, which can differentiate nontrivial variational problems such as Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and multilayer perceptrons.">

        <tr id="Integrative structural biology synergizes experimental data with computational methods to elucidate the structures and interactions within biomolecules, a task that becomes critical in the absence of high-resolution structural data. A critical step in integrating the data, is knowing the expected accuracy or belief in the dataset. We previously showed that the Modeling Employing Limited Data (MELD) approach succeeds at predicting structures and finding the best interpretation of the data when the initial belief is equal or slightly lower than the real value. But, this initial belief is not known for many data sources. Here we introduce MELD-Adapt, designed to dynamically evaluate and infer the reliability of input data, thereby enhancing the accuracy of structure predictions. We demonstrate the utility of this method across different systems, particularly emphasizing its capability to correct initial assumptions and identify the correct fraction of data to produce reliable structural models. The approach is tested with two benchmark sets: the folding of twelve proteins with coarse physical insights and the binding of peptides with varying affinities to the Extrateterminal (ET) domain. Our findings also show the importance of how data is distributed in the system (locally clustered or globally distributed) and the subtle balance between data, beliefs, and force fields.">

        <tr id="The modern digital engineering design often requires costly repeated simulations for different scenarios. The prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them suitable surrogates for providing design insights. However, only a few NNs can efficiently handle complex engineering scenario predictions. We introduce a new version of the neural operators called DeepOKAN, which utilizes Kolmogorov Arnold networks (KANs) rather than the conventional neural network architectures. Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. The DeepOKAN is used to develop surrogates for different mechanics problems. This approach should pave the way for further improving the performance of neural operators. Based on the current investigations, we observe that DeepOKANs require a smaller number of learnable parameters than current MLP-based DeepONets to achieve comparable accuracy.">
