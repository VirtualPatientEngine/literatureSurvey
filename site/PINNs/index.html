In this two part treatise, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct classes of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information. In this first part, we demonstrate how these networks can be used to infer solutions to partial differential equations, and obtain physics-informed surrogate models that are fully differentiable with respect to all input coordinates and free parameters.">

In this second part of our two-part treatise, we focus on the problem of data-driven discovery of partial differential equations.

The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using a wide range of benchmark problems in mathematical physics, including conservation laws, incompressible fluid flow, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.">

        <tr id="The process of transforming observed data into predictive mathematical models of the physical world has always been paramount in science and engineering. Although data is currently being collected at an ever-increasing pace, devising meaningful models out of such observations in an automated fashion still remains an open problem. In this work, we put forth a machine learning approach for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Specifically, we blend classical tools from numerical analysis, namely the multi-step time-stepping schemes, with powerful nonlinear function approximators, namely deep neural networks, to distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems involving the identification of complex, nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and we demonstrate how this allows us to accurately learn the dynamics, forecast future states, and identify basins of attraction. In particular, we study the Lorenz system, the fluid flow behind a cylinder, the Hopf bifurcation, and the Glycoltic oscillator model as an example of complicated nonlinear dynamics typical of biological systems.">

        <tr id="Mathematical models of biological reactions at the system-level lead to a set of ordinary differential equations with many unknown parameters that need to be inferred using relatively few experimental measurements. Having a reliable and robust algorithm for parameter inference and prediction of the hidden dynamics has been one of the core subjects in systems biology, and is the focus of this study. We have developed a new systems-biology-informed deep learning algorithm that incorporates the system of ordinary differential equations into the neural networks. Enforcing these equations effectively adds constraints to the optimization procedure that manifests itself as an imposed structure on the observational data. Using few scattered and noisy measurements, we are able to infer the dynamics of unobserved species, external forcing, and the unknown model parameters. We have successfully tested the algorithm for three different benchmark problems. Author summary The dynamics of systems biological processes are usually modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which introduce various unknown parameters that need to be estimated efficiently from noisy measurements of concentration for a few species only. In this work, we present a new “systems-informed neural network” to infer the dynamics of experimentally unobserved species as well as the unknown parameters in the system of equations. By incorporating the system of ODEs into the neural networks, we effectively add constraints to the optimization algorithm, which makes the method robust to noisy and sparse measurements.">

        <tr id="This study aims to provide insights into new areas of artificial intelligence approaches by examining how these techniques can be applied to predict behaviours for difficult physical processes represented by partial differential equations, particularly equations involving nonlinear dispersive behaviours. The current advection-dispersion-reaction equation is one of the key formulas used to depict natural processes with distinct characteristics. It is composed of a first-order advection component, a third-order dispersion term, and a nonlinear response term. Using the deep neural network approach and accounting for physics-informed neural network awareness, the problem has been elaborately discussed. Initial and boundary conditions are added as constraints when the neural networks are trained by minimizing the loss function. In comparison to the existing results, the approach has produced qualitatively correct kink and anti-kink solutions, with losses often remaining around 0.01%. It has also outperformed several traditional discretization-based methods.">

        <tr id="Deep learning with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has emerged as a highly popular and effective approach for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this paper, we first investigate the extrapolation capability of the PINN method for time-dependent PDEs. Taking advantage of this extrapolation property, we can generalize the training result obtained in the time subinterval to the large interval by adding a correction term to the network parameters of the subinterval. The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.">

In particular, we compare them with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks (DeepONets), which are based on the standard MLP representation. We find that although the original KANs based on the B-splines parameterization lack accuracy and efficiency, modified versions based on low-order orthogonal polynomials have comparable performance to PINNs and DeepONet although they still lack robustness as they may diverge for different random seeds or higher order orthogonal polynomials. We visualize their corresponding loss landscapes and analyze their learning dynamics using information bottleneck theory.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising way to compute the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep neural networks. However, despite their significant success in various fields, it remains unclear in many aspects how to effectively train PINNs if the solutions of PDEs exhibit stiff behaviors or high frequencies. In this paper, we propose a new method for training PINNs using variable-scaling techniques. This method is simple and it can be applied to a wide range of problems including PDEs with rapidly-varying solutions. Throughout various numerical experiments, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for these problems and confirm that it can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of PINNs. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we will provide theoretical evidence for this phenomenon and show that our methods can indeed improve the performance of PINNs.">

Physics-informed neural networks are an optimization based approach for solving differential equations that is completely meshless. This substantially simplifies the modeling of the inundation process of tsunamis. While physics-informed neural networks require retraining for each particular new initial condition of the shallow-water equations, we also introduce the use of deep operator networks that can be trained to learn the solution operator instead of a particular solution only and thus provides substantial speed-ups, also compared to classical numerical approaches for tsunami models. We show with several classical benchmarks that our method can model both tsunami propagation and the inundation process exceptionally well.">

        <tr id="Wildland fires pose terrifying natural hazards, underscoring the urgent need to develop data-driven and physics-informed digital twins for wildfire prevention, monitoring, intervention, and response. In this direction of research, this work introduces a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) to learn the unknown parameters of an interpretable wildfire spreading model. The considered wildfire spreading model integrates fundamental physical laws articulated by key model parameters, essential for capturing the complex behavior of wildfires. The proposed machine learning approach leverages the theory of artificial neural networks with the physical constraints governing wildfire dynamics, such as the first principles of mass and energy conservation. Training of the PiNN for physics-informed parameter identification is realized using data of the temporal evolution of one- and two-dimensional (plane surface) fire fronts that have been obtained from a high-fidelity simulator of the wildfire spreading model under consideration. The parameter learning results demonstrate the remarkable predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in uncovering the unknown coefficients in both the one- and two-dimensional fire spreading scenarios. Additionally, this methodology exhibits robustness by identifying the same parameters in the presence of noisy data. The proposed framework is envisioned to be incorporated in a physics-informed digital twin for intelligent wildfire management and risk assessment.">

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

The network is trained by embedding physics-informed constraints. Different from traditional neural networks for solving partial differential equations, the proposed method uses a deep neural operator network to indirectly construct the mapping relationship between the variable functions and solution functions. This approach makes full use of the hidden information between the variable functions and independent variables. The process whereby the model captures incredibly complex and highly nonlinear relationships is simplified, thereby making network learning easier and enhancing the extraction of information about the independent variables in partial differential systems. In terms of solving partial differential equations, we verify that the multi-step physics-informed deep operator neural network markedly improves the solution accuracy compared with a traditional physics-informed deep neural operator network, especially when the problem involves complex physical phenomena with large gradient changes.">

        <tr id="Physics informed neural networks have been gaining popularity due to their unique ability to incorporate physics laws into data-driven models, ensuring that the predictions are not only consistent with empirical data but also align with domain-specific knowledge in the form of physics equations. The integration of physics principles enables the method to require less data while maintaining the robustness of deep learning in modeling complex dynamical systems. However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Preliminary results indicate that physics-informed machine learning holds significant potential for advancing the study of ecological systems.">

While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling.

        <tr id="Parameter estimation is one of the central problems in computational modeling of biological systems. Typically, scientists must fully specify the mathematical structure of the model, often expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations, to estimate the parameters. This process poses significant challenges due to the necessity for a detailed understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating model parameters and assessing their identifiability in situations where only partial knowledge of the system structure is available. The partially known model is extended into a system of Hybrid Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, which captures the unknown portions of the system using neural networks. Integrating neural networks into the model structure introduces two primary challenges for parameter estimation: the need to globally explore the search space while employing gradient-based optimization, and the assessment of parameter identifiability, which may be hindered by the expressive nature of neural networks. To overcome the first issue, we treat biological parameters as hyperparameters in the extended model, exploring the parameter search space during hyperparameter tuning. The second issue is then addressed by an a posteriori analysis of parameter identifiability, computed by introducing a variant of a well-established approach for mechanistic models. These two components are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that is thoroughly described in the paper. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on test cases derived from three different benchmark models. These test cases have been designed to mimic real-world conditions, including the presence of noise in the training data and various levels of data availability for the system variables. Author summary Parameter estimation is a central challenge in modeling biological systems. Typically, scientists calibrate the parameters by aligning model predictions with measured data once the model structure is defined. Our paper introduces a workflow that leverages the integration between mechanistic modeling and machine learning to estimate model parameters when the model structure is not fully known. We focus mainly on analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters, which measures how confident we can be in the parameter estimates given the available experimental data and partial mechanistic understanding of the system. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach in various in silico scenarios. Our workflow represents a first step to adapting traditional methods used in fully mechanistic models to the scenario of hybrid modeling.">

        <tr id="Stress and material deformation field predictions are among the most important tasks in computational mechanics. These predictions are typically made by solving the governing equations of continuum mechanics using finite element analysis, which can become computationally prohibitive considering complex microstructures and material behaviors. Machine learning (ML) methods offer potentially cost effective surrogates for these applications. However, existing ML surrogates are either limited to low-dimensional problems and/or do not provide uncertainty estimates in the predictions. This work proposes an ML surrogate framework for stress field prediction and uncertainty quantification for diverse materials microstructures. A modified Bayesian U-net architecture is employed to provide a data-driven image-to-image mapping from initial microstructure to stress field with prediction (epistemic) uncertainty estimates. The Bayesian posterior distributions for the U-net parameters are estimated using three state-of-the-art inference algorithms: the posterior sampling-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method and two variational approaches, the Monte-Carlo Dropout method and the Bayes by Backprop algorithm. A systematic comparison of the predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimates for these methods is performed for a fiber reinforced composite material and polycrystalline microstructure application. It is shown that the proposed methods yield predictions of high accuracy compared to the FEA solution, while uncertainty estimates depend on the inference approach. Generally, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Bayes by Backprop methods provide consistent uncertainty estimates. Uncertainty estimates from Monte Carlo Dropout, on the other hand, are more difficult to interpret and depend strongly on the method's design.">

        <tr id=". In this paper, we develop a cell-average based neural network (CANN) method for solving the Hunter-Saxton equation with its zero-viscosity and zero-dispersion limits. Motivated from the ﬁnite volume schemes, the cell-average based neural network method is constructed based on the ﬁnite volume integrals of the original PDEs. Supervised training is designed to learn the solution average difference between two neighboring time steps. The training data set is generated by the cell average based on a single initial value of the given PDE. The training process employs multiple time levels of cell averages to maintain stability and control temporal accumulation errors. After being well trained based on appropriate meshes, this method can be utilized like a regular explicit ﬁnite volume method to evolve the solution under large time steps. Furthermore, it can be applied to solve different type of initial value problems without retraining the neural network. In order to validate the capability and robustness of the CANN method, we also utilize it to deal with the corrupted learning data which is generated from the Gaussian white noise. Several numerical examples of different types of Hunter-Saxton equations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, capability, and robustness of the proposed method.

        <tr id="We propose a novel finite element-based physics-informed operator learning framework that allows for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed framework employs a loss function inspired by the finite element method (FEM) with the implicit Euler time integration scheme. A transient thermal conduction problem is considered to benchmark the performance. The proposed operator learning framework takes a temperature field at the current time step as input and predicts a temperature field at the next time step. The Galerkin discretized weak formulation of the heat equation is employed to incorporate physics into the loss function, which is coined finite operator learning (FOL). Upon training, the networks successfully predict the temperature evolution over time for any initial temperature field at high accuracy compared to the FEM solution. The framework is also confirmed to be applicable to a heterogeneous thermal conductivity and arbitrary geometry. The advantages of FOL can be summarized as follows: First, the training is performed in an unsupervised manner, avoiding the need for a large data set prepared from costly simulations or experiments. Instead, random temperature patterns generated by the Gaussian random process and the Fourier series, combined with constant temperature fields, are used as training data to cover possible temperature cases. Second, shape functions and backward difference approximation are exploited for the domain discretization, resulting in a purely algebraic equation. This enhances training efficiency, as one avoids time-consuming automatic differentiation when optimizing weights and biases while accepting possible discretization errors. Finally, thanks to the interpolation power of FEM, any arbitrary geometry can be handled with FOL, which is crucial to addressing various engineering application scenarios.">

The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries. These results highlight the unique generalization capability of the proposed operator learning approach.">

As surrogates, two distinct models are developed utilizing physics-informed neural networks, which integrate experimental data with given governing laws of physics. The experimental data (sensor data) is obtained from a previously conducted four-point bending test. The first surrogate model predicts strains at fixed locations along the center line of the beam for various time instances. This time-dependent surrogate model is inspired by the motion of a harmonic oscillator. For this study, we further compare the physics-based approach with a purely data-driven method, revealing the significance of physical laws for the extrapolation capabilities of models in scenarios with limited access to experimental data. Furthermore, we identify the natural frequency of the system by utilizing the physics-based model as an inverse solver. For the second surrogate model, we then focus on a fixed instance in time and combine the sensor data with the equations of linear elasticity to predict the strain distribution within the beam. This example reveals the importance of balancing different loss components through the selection of suitable loss weights.">

The impact of physics-informed neural networks helps to approximate elliptic partial differential equations governed by the physical process. The proposed technique employs learning the behaviour of complex systems based on input-output data, and automatic differentiation ensures accurate computation of gradient. The method computes the singularity-embedded local fractional partial derivative model on a Hausdorff metric, which otherwise halts the computation by available approximating numerical methods. This is possible because the new network is capable of updating the weight associated with loss terms depending on the solution domain and requirement of solution behaviour. The semi-positive definite character of the neural tangent kernel achieves the convergence of gradient-based adaptive neural networks. The importance of hyperparameters, namely the number of neurons and the learning rate, is shown by considering a stationary anomalous diffusion-convection model on a rectangular domain. The proposed method showcases the network’s ability to approximate solutions of various local fractional elliptic partial differential equations with varying fractal parameters.">

This is combined with a physics-aware implicit solver that consists of a much coarser, discretized version of the original PDE, which provides the requisite information bottleneck for high-dimensional problems and enables generalization in out-of-distribution settings (e.g. different boundary conditions). We demonstrate its capability in the context of random heterogeneous materials where the input parameters represent the material microstructure. We extend the framework to multiscale problems and show that a surrogate can be learned for the effective (homogenized) solution without ever solving the reference problem. We further demonstrate how the proposed framework can accommodate and generalize several existing learning objectives and architectures while yielding probabilistic surrogates that can quantify predictive uncertainty.">

We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation.

Inexpensive to evaluate, POD-DL-ROMs are also relatively fast to train, thanks to their limited complexity. However, POD-DL-ROMs account for the physical laws governing the problem at hand only through the training data, that are usually obtained through a full order model (FOM) relying on a high-fidelity discretization of the underlying equations. Moreover, the accuracy of POD-DL-ROMs strongly depends on the amount of available data. In this paper, we consider a major extension of POD-DL-ROMs by enforcing the fulfillment of the governing physical laws in the training process -- that is, by making them physics-informed -- to compensate for possible scarce and/or unavailable data and improve the overall reliability. To do that, we first complement POD-DL-ROMs with a trunk net architecture, endowing them with the ability to compute the problem's solution at every point in the spatial domain, and ultimately enabling a seamless computation of the physics-based loss by means of the strong continuous formulation. Then, we introduce an efficient training strategy that limits the notorious computational burden entailed by a physics-informed training phase. In particular, we take advantage of the few available data to develop a low-cost pre-training procedure; then, we fine-tune the architecture in order to further improve the prediction reliability. Accuracy and efficiency of the resulting pre-trained physics-informed DL-ROMs (PTPI-DL-ROMs) are then assessed on a set of test cases ranging from non-affinely parametrized advection-diffusion-reaction equations, to nonlinear problems like the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flows.">

        <tr id="Simulating spatiotemporal turbulence with high fidelity remains a cornerstone challenge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) due to its intricate multiscale nature and prohibitive computational demands. Traditional approaches typically employ closure models, which attempt to represent small-scale features in an unresolved manner. However, these methods often sacrifice accuracy and lose high-frequency/wavenumber information, especially in scenarios involving complex flow physics. In this paper, we introduce an innovative neural differentiable modeling framework designed to enhance the predictability and efficiency of spatiotemporal turbulence simulations. Our approach features differentiable hybrid modeling techniques that seamlessly integrate deep neural networks with numerical PDE solvers within a differentiable programming framework, synergizing deep learning with physics-based CFD modeling. Specifically, a hybrid differentiable neural solver is constructed on a coarser grid to capture large-scale turbulent phenomena, followed by the application of a Bayesian conditional diffusion model that generates small-scale turbulence conditioned on large-scale flow predictions. Two innovative hybrid architecture designs are studied, and their performance is evaluated through comparative analysis against conventional large eddy simulation techniques with physics-based subgrid-scale closures and purely data-driven neural solvers. The findings underscore the potential of the neural differentiable modeling framework to significantly enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency of turbulence simulations. This study not only demonstrates the efficacy of merging deep learning with physics-based numerical solvers but also sets a new precedent for advanced CFD modeling techniques, highlighting the transformative impact of differentiable programming in scientific computing.">

        <tr id="The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

        <tr id="Scientific Machine Learning is a new class of approaches that integrate physical knowledge and mechanistic models with data-driven techniques for uncovering governing equations of complex processes. Among the available approaches, Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) are used to combine prior knowledge in the form of mechanistic formulations with universal function approximators, like neural networks. Integral to the efficacy of UDEs is the joint estimation of parameters within mechanistic formulations and the universal function approximators using empirical data. The robustness and applicability of resultant models, however, hinge upon the rigorous quantification of uncertainties associated with these parameters, as well as the predictive capabilities of the overall model or its constituent components. With this work, we provide a formalisation of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for UDEs and investigate important frequentist and Bayesian methods. By analysing three synthetic examples of varying complexity, we evaluate the validity and efficiency of ensembles, variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as epistemic UQ methods for UDEs.">

In DANN, each neuron is equipped with two activation functions to augment the network's nonlinear expressive capacity. Additionally, a new parameter is introduced for the construction of the quadratic terms in one of two activation functions, which further enhances the network's ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships. To address the issue of low fitting accuracy caused by the discontinuity of solution's derivative, a piecewise fitting approach is proposed by dividing the global solving domain into several subdomains. The convergence of the loss function is proven. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the superior accuracy and faster convergence of DANN compared to the traditional physics-informed neural network (PINN).">

        <tr id="In this paper, we investigate the full-waveform inversion (FWI) for elastic wave equation as training a neural network. The forward modeling of the elastic wave equation in the time domain by the staggered-grid difference schemes can be reformulated as a process of a recurrent neural network (RNN). As a result, the FWI problem is equivalent to neural network training, and the parameter of RNN coincides with the model parameter of inversion. Furthermore, a variety of stochastic optimizers including Adgrad, RMSprop, Adam, Nadam and Admax in neural networks can be applied in the training process. The gradient of the objective function with the model parameters is computed by the technique of automatic differentiation instead of the adjoint-state method in the traditional FWI. A new objective function of FWI is also proposed. Compared to the traditional FWI methods, the developed FWI using tools of neural networks has a relatively good robustness. Numerical computations and comparisons with Marmousi model for two and three parameters simultaneous inversion are completed. The results show that the algorithms except Adgrad can yield good inversion results. The FWI framework developed in this paper has potential applications for other complex partial equations.">

        <tr id="Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, more data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalizable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than the neural network alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularization, penalizing biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularization not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularization reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses. Author summary Systems biology concerns the modelling and analysis of biological processes, by viewing these as interconnected systems. Modelling is typically done either using mechanistic differential equations that are derived from experiments and known biology, or using machine learning on large biological datasets. While mathematical modelling from biological experiments can provide useful insights with limited data, building and validating these models takes a long time and often requires highly invasive measurements in humans. Efforts to combine this classical technique with machine learning have resulted in a framework termed universal differential equations, where the model equations contain a neural network to describe unknown biological interactions. While these methods have shown success in numerous fields, applications in biology are more challenging due to limited data-availability, high data sparsity. In this work, we have introduced physiology-informed regularization to overcome these instabilities and to constrain the model to biologically plausible behavior. Our results show that by using physiology-informed regularization, we can accurately predict future unseen observations in a simulated example, with much more limited data than a similar model without regularization. Additionally, we show an application of this technique on human data, applying a neural network to learn the appearance of glucose in the blood plasma after a meal.">

This paper introduces an advanced physics-informed DeepONet tailored for such complex systems with multiple input functions. Equipped with architectural enhancements like nonlinear decoders and effective training strategies such as curriculum learning and domain decomposition, the proposed model handles high-dimensional design spaces with significantly improved accuracy, outperforming the vanilla physics-informed DeepONet by two orders of magnitude.

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

        <tr id="Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.">

However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization.

In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm.

        <tr id="Given the existence of various forward and inverse problems in combustion studies and applications that necessitate distinct methods for resolution, a framework to solve them in a unified way is critically needed. A promising approach is the integration of machine learning methods with governing equations of combustion systems, which exhibits superior generality and few-shot learning ability compared to purely data-driven methods. In this work, the FlamePINN-1D framework is proposed to solve the forward and inverse problems of 1D laminar flames based on physics-informed neural networks. Three cases with increasing complexity have been tested: Case 1 are freely-propagating premixed (FPP) flames with simplified physical models, while Case 2 and Case 3 are FPP and counterflow premixed (CFP) flames with detailed models, respectively. For forward problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to solve the flame fields and infer the unknown eigenvalues (such as laminar flame speeds) under the constraints of governing equations and boundary conditions. For inverse problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to reconstruct the continuous fields and infer the unknown parameters (such as transport and chemical kinetics parameters) from noisy sparse observations of the flame. Our results strongly validate these capabilities of FlamePINN-1D across various flames and working conditions. Compared to traditional methods, FlamePINN-1D is differentiable and mesh-free, exhibits no discretization errors, and is easier to implement for inverse problems. The inverse problem results also indicate the possibility of optimizing chemical mechanisms from measurements of laboratory 1D flames. Furthermore, some proposed strategies, such as hard constraints and thin-layer normalization, are proven to be essential for the robust learning of FlamePINN-1D.

This paper introduces a novel, data-driven framework that synergizes physics-based priors with advanced ML techniques to address the computational and practical limitations inherent in first-principle-based methods and brute-force machine learning methods. Our framework showcases four algorithms, each embedding a specific physics-based prior tailored to a particular class of nonlinear systems, including separable and nonseparable Hamiltonian systems, hyperbolic partial differential equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics. The intrinsic incorporation of physical laws preserves the system's intrinsic symmetries and conservation laws, ensuring solutions are physically plausible and computationally efficient. The integration of these priors also enhances the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns typical in physical phenomena that conventional methods often miss. As a result, our models outperform existing data-driven techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, and predictive capability, particularly in recognizing features absent from the training set, despite relying on small datasets, short training periods, and small sample sizes.">

We explore using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling dynamic processes governed by differential-algebraic equation systems when process data is scarce and complete mechanistic knowledge is missing. In particular, we focus on estimating states for which neither direct observational data nor constitutive equations are available. For demonstration purposes, we study a continuously stirred tank reactor and a liquid-liquid separator. We find that PINNs can infer unmeasured states with reasonable accuracy, and they generalize better in low-data scenarios than purely data-driven models. We thus show that PINNs, similar to hybrid mechanistic/data-driven models, are capable of modeling processes when relatively few experimental data and only partially known mechanistic descriptions are available, and conclude that they constitute a promising avenue that warrants further investigation.">

Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting. Furthermore, our method achieves rapid adaptation to new CSTRs, BRs, and PFRs using only a few data samples from the designated tasks.

Since a surrogate emulates the original model accurately in near-real time, it yields a speed benefit that can be used to carry out orders of magnitude more function calls quickly.

        <tr id="Solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with multiple solutions using neural networks has found widespread applications in various fields such as physics, biology, and engineering. However, classical neural network methods for solving nonlinear PDEs, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), Deep Ritz methods, and DeepONet, often encounter challenges when confronted with the presence of multiple solutions inherent in the nonlinear problem. These methods may encounter ill-posedness issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the Newton Informed Neural Operator, which builds upon existing neural network techniques to tackle nonlinearities. Our method combines classical Newton methods, addressing well-posed problems, and efficiently learns multiple solutions in a single learning process while requiring fewer supervised data points compared to existing neural network methods.">

We introduce Bayesian Entropy Neural Networks (BENN), a framework grounded in Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principles, designed to impose constraints on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) predictions. BENN is capable of constraining not only the predicted values but also their derivatives and variances, ensuring a more robust and reliable model output. To achieve simultaneous uncertainty quantification and constraint satisfaction, we employ the method of multipliers approach. This allows for the concurrent estimation of neural network parameters and the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the constraints. Our experiments, spanning diverse applications such as beam deflection modeling and microstructure generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of BENN. The results highlight significant improvements over traditional BNNs and showcase competitive performance relative to contemporary constrained deep learning methods.">

In this work, we propose a data-driven, non-intrusive method that utilizes stochastic variational deep kernel learning (SVDKL) to discover low-dimensional latent spaces from data and a recurrent version of SVDKL for representing and predicting the evolution of latent dynamics. The proposed method is demonstrated with two challenging examples -- a double pendulum and a reaction-diffusion system.

Integrable nonlinear lattice equations possess a profound mathematical structure that enables them to revert to continuous integrable equations in the continuous limit, particularly retaining integrable properties such as conservation laws, Hamiltonian structure, and multiple soliton solutions. The pseudo grid-based physics-informed convolutional-recurrent network (PG-PhyCRNet) is proposed to investigate the localized wave solutions of integrable lattice equations, which significantly enhances the model's extrapolation capability to lattice points beyond the temporal domain. We conduct a comparative analysis of PG-PhyCRNet with and without pseudo grid by investigating the multi-soliton solutions and rational solitons of the Toda lattice and self-dual network equation. The results indicate that the PG-PhyCRNet excels in capturing long-term evolution and enhances the model's extrapolation capability for solitons, particularly those with steep waveforms and high wave speeds. Finally, the robustness of the PG-PhyCRNet method and its effect on the prediction of solutions in different scenarios are confirmed through repeated experiments involving pseudo grid partitioning.">

        <tr id="Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.">

        <tr id="We developed a novel reservoir characterization workflow that addresses reservoir history matching by coupling a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) forward model with a mixture of experts' approach, termed cluster classify regress (CCR). The inverse modelling is achieved via an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman inversion (aREKI) method, ideal for rapid inverse uncertainty quantification during history matching. We parametrize unknown permeability and porosity fields for non-Gaussian posterior measures using a variational convolution autoencoder and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) exotic priors. The CCR works as a supervised model with the PINO surrogate to replicate nonlinear Peaceman well equations. The CCR's flexibility allows any independent machine-learning algorithm for each stage. The PINO reservoir surrogate's loss function is derived from supervised data loss and losses from the initial conditions and residual of the governing black oil PDE. The PINO-CCR surrogate outputs pressure, water, and gas saturations, along with oil, water, and gas production rates. The methodology was compared to a standard numerical black oil simulator for a waterflooding case on the Norne field, showing similar outputs. This PINO-CCR surrogate was then used in the aREKI history matching workflow, successfully recovering the unknown permeability, porosity and fault multiplier, with simulations up to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. Training the PINO-CCR surrogate on an NVIDIA H100 with 80G memory takes about 5 hours for 100 samples of the Norne field. This workflow is suitable for ensemble-based approaches, where posterior density sampling, given an expensive likelihood evaluation, is desirable for uncertainty quantification.">

        <tr id="This study briefly describes the concept of guided training of deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn physically reasonable solutions. The proposed method does not need the gradients of the physical equations, although the conventional physics-informed models need the gradients. DNNs are widely used to predict phenomena in physics and mechanics. One of the issues with DNNs is that their output does not always satisfy physical equations. One approach to consider with physical equations is adding a residual of the equations into the loss function; this is called physics-informed neural network (PINN). One feature of PINNs is that the physical equations and corresponding residuals must be implemented as part of a neural network model. In addition, the residual does not always converge to a small value. The proposed model is a physics-guided generative adversarial network (PG-GAN) that uses a GAN architecture, in which physical equations are used to judge whether the neural network’s output is consistent with physics. The proposed method was applied to a simple problem to assess its potential usability.">

One advantage of the neural network method for PDEs lies in its automatic differentiation (AD), which necessitates only the sample points themselves, unlike traditional finite difference (FD) approximations that require nearby local points to compute derivatives. In this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of AD in training neural networks. The concept of truncated entropy is introduced to characterize the training property. Specifically, through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses conducted on random feature models and two-layer neural networks, we discover that the defined truncated entropy serves as a reliable metric for quantifying the residual loss of random feature models and the training speed of neural networks for both AD and FD methods. Our experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that, from a training perspective, AD outperforms FD in solving partial differential equations.">

However, PINNs are not well suited for solving PDEs with multiscale features, particularly suffering from slow convergence and poor accuracy. To address this limitation of PINNs, this article proposes physics-informed cell representations for resolving multiscale Poisson problems using a model architecture consisting of multilevel multiresolution grids coupled with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The grid parameters (i.e., the level-dependent feature vectors) and the MLP parameters (i.e., the weights and biases) are determined using gradient-descent based optimization. The variational (weak) form based loss function accelerates computation by allowing the linear interpolation of feature vectors within grid cells. This cell-based MLP model also facilitates the use of a decoupled training scheme for Dirichlet boundary conditions and a parameter-sharing scheme for periodic boundary conditions, delivering superior accuracy compared to conventional PINNs. Furthermore, the numerical examples highlight improved speed and accuracy in solving PDEs with nonlinear or high-frequency boundary conditions and provide insights into hyperparameter selection. In essence, by cell-based MLP model along with the parallel tiny-cuda-nn library, our implementation improves convergence speed and numerical accuracy.">

This paper proposes a novel framework: a closed-form \textbf{Sym}bolic framework for \textbf{PDE}s (SymPDE), exploring the use of deep reinforcement learning to directly obtain symbolic solutions for PDEs. SymPDE alleviates the challenges PINNs face in fitting high-frequency and steeply changing functions. To our knowledge, no prior work has implemented this approach.

Traditional numerical methods for these problems are mesh-based, thus struggling with the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising solution due to their universal approximation, generalization ability, and mesh-free training. In principle, Monte Carlo fractional PINN (MC-fPINN) estimates fractional derivatives using Monte Carlo methods and thus could lift CoD. However, this may cause significant variance and errors, hence affecting convergence; in addition, MC-fPINN is sensitive to hyperparameters. In general, numerical methods and specifically PINNs for tempered fractional PDEs are under-developed. Herein, we extend MC-fPINN to tempered fractional PDEs to address these issues, resulting in the Monte Carlo tempered fractional PINN (MC-tfPINN). To reduce possible high variance and errors from Monte Carlo sampling, we replace the one-dimensional (1D) Monte Carlo with 1D Gaussian quadrature, applicable to both MC-fPINN and MC-tfPINN. We validate our methods on various forward and inverse problems of fractional and tempered fractional PDEs, scaling up to 100,000 dimensions. Our improved MC-fPINN/MC-tfPINN using quadrature consistently outperforms the original versions in accuracy and convergence speed in very high dimensions.">

It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model.

 Deterministic Neural Networks (NNs) have been widely adopted to represent system behaviors in various engineering problems, which have been criticized for providing overconfident predictions. This challenge, i.e., overfitting, refers to a model that captures data patterns and random noise during the learning process, leading to an inferior predictive capability in the unobserved domains. As known to all, Bayesian inference offers an effective way for uncertainty quantification (UQ) to help enhance model predictions and offer informed decision-making. Integrating deterministic NN models with Bayesian inference provides a way to fast simulate and quantify both data and model uncertainty simultaneously. Thereby, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), a combination of standard NNs with Bayesian philosophy, introduce probability to the network parameters, i.e., biases and weights. In BNNs, predictive uncertainty reflects how confident model predictions are regarding the corresponding credible intervals, which helps identify overfitting and interpreting abnormal predictions. Another advantage is that BNNs naturally implement regularization by integrating over the weights such that BNNs can reach good generalization when data availability is limited. BNNs rely heavily on observations as a purely data-driven approach. Besides, standard BNNs have relatively complex network structures, which makes it hard to provide detailed interpretability on model predictions. Researchers share concerns about their predictions that may violate real-world phenomena. The combination of physics knowledge with the optimization objective can improve the adherence of predictions with the known physical principles. Physics laws are usually embedded as constraint functions in the process of optimization. With the help of constrained optimization, model predictions keep consistent with the known physical principles.
 The authors refine BNNs with physics-guided information, i.e., Physics-Guided BNNs (PG-BNNs), to reduce dependence on data, improve model interpretability, and offer reliable model predictions. PG-BNNs interpret the known physics knowledge as constraint functions to better guide optimization processes, especially for case studies with sparse and limited data sets. A case study of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) problem is carried out to compare the performance of PG-BNN and unconstrained BNN models and demonstrate the effectiveness of PG-BNN.">

In this work, we explore the use of physics informed neural networks to learn an end-to-end model of the multirotor-slung-load system and, at a given time, estimate a sequence of the future system states. An LSTM encoder decoder with an attention mechanism is used to capture the dynamics of the system. To guarantee the cohesiveness between the multiple predicted states of the system, we propose the use of a physics-based term in the loss function, which includes a discretized physical model derived from first principles together with slack variables that allow for a small mismatch between expected and predicted values. To train the model, a dataset using a real-world quadrotor carrying a slung load was curated and is made available. Prediction results are presented and corroborate the feasibility of the approach. The proposed method outperforms both the first principles physical model and a comparable neural network model trained without the physics regularization proposed.">

However, many PINN-like methods are poorly scalable and are limited to in-sample scenarios. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel discrete approach termed Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (PIGNN) to solve forward and inverse nonlinear PDEs. In particular, our approach seamlessly integrates the strength of graph neural networks (GNN), physical equations and finite difference to approximate solutions of physical systems. Our approach is compared with the PINN baseline on three well-known nonlinear PDEs (heat, Burgers and FitzHugh-Nagumo). We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method to work with irregular meshes, longer time steps, arbitrary spatial resolutions, varying initial conditions (ICs) and boundary conditions (BCs) by conducting extensive numerical experiments. Numerical results also illustrate the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy, time extrapolability, generalizability and scalability. The main advantage of our approach is that models trained in small domains with simple settings have excellent fitting capabilities and can be directly applied to more complex situations in large domains.">

End-to-end machine learning approaches to inverse problems typically require constructing sophisticated estimators to achieve the desired accuracy, largely because they need to learn the complex underlying physical model. Here, we discuss an alternative paradigm: by making the physical model auto-differentiable we can construct a neural surrogate to represent the unknown physical quantity sought, while avoiding having to relearn the known physics entirely. We dub this process surrogate training embedded in physics (STEP) and illustrate that it generalizes well and is robust against overfitting and significant noise in the data. We demonstrate how STEP can be applied to perform dynamic kernel deconvolution to analyse resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra and show that surprisingly simple estimator architectures suffice to extract the relevant physical information.">

Machine learning techniques are a relatively recent method for solving PDEs. Despite the increasing number of machine learning strategies developed to approximate PDEs, many remain focused on relatively small domains. When scaling the equations, a large domain is naturally obtained, especially when the solution exhibits multiscale characteristics. This study examines two-scale equations whose solution structures exhibit distinct characteristics: highly localized in some regions and significantly flat in others. These two regions must be adequately addressed over a large domain to approximate the solution more accurately. We focus on the vanishing gradient problem given by the diminishing gradient zone of the activation function over large domains and propose a stratified sampling algorithm to address this problem. We compare the uniform random classical sampling method over the entire domain and the proposed stratified sampling method. The numerical results confirm that the proposed method yields more accurate and consistent solutions than classical methods.">

In this paper, we find an approximate solution of the partial differential equation in the weak form. Our method can achieve high accuracy with low cost of training. Numerical examples show that the cost of training these base functions is low, and only one hundred to two thousand epochs are needed for most tests.

It aims to estimate the state of a potentially large system, such as the atmosphere, from sparse observations, supplemented by prior physical knowledge. The size of the systems involved and the complexity of the underlying physical equations make it a challenging task from a computational point of view. Neural networks represent a promising method of emulating the physics at low cost, and therefore have the potential to considerably improve and accelerate data assimilation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning approach where the physical system is modeled as a sequence of coarse-to-fine Gaussian prior distributions parametrized by a neural network. This allows us to define an assimilation operator, which is trained in an end-to-end fashion to minimize the reconstruction error on a dataset with different observation processes.

This makes the AdaI-PINNs framework fully automated without requiring preset activation functions.

Greedy samples are used to train a physics-informed neural network architecture which maps the nonlinear relation between spatio-temporal data and the measured values. To prove the impact of greedy samples on the training of the physics-informed neural network for parameter estimation of a partial differential equation, their performance is compared with random samples taken from the given dataset. Our simulation results show that for all considered partial differential equations, greedy samples outperform random samples, i.e., we can estimate parameters with a significantly lower number of samples while simultaneously reducing the relative estimation error. A Python package is also prepared to support different phases of the proposed algorithm, including data prepossessing, greedy sampling, neural network training, and comparison.">

While mathematically equivalent, these forms are not computationally equivalent, making the exploration of different PDE formulations significant in computational physics. Thus, we propose different PDE forms based on KAN instead of MLP, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Informed Neural Network (KINN). We systematically compare MLP and KAN in various numerical examples of PDEs, including multi-scale, singularity, stress concentration, nonlinear hyperelasticity, heterogeneous, and complex geometry problems. Our results demonstrate that KINN significantly outperforms MLP in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for numerous PDEs in computational solid mechanics, except for the complex geometry problem.

This fact, along with the requirement of substantial computational resources, poses a barrier to achieving high numerical accuracy. Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs.

To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

However, due to their long training times, PINNs are currently not as competitive as established numerical methods. A promising approach to bridge this gap is transfer learning (TL), that is, reusing the weights and biases of readily trained neural network models to accelerate model training for new learning tasks. This work applies TL to improve the performance of PINNs in the context of magnetostatic field simulation, in particular to resolve boundary value problems with geometrical variations of the computational domain. The suggested TL workflow consists of three steps. (a) A numerical solution based on the finite element method (FEM). (b) A neural network that approximates the FEM solution using standard supervised learning. (c) A PINN initialized with the weights and biases of the pre‐trained neural network and further trained using the deep Ritz method. The FEM solution and its neural network‐based approximation refer to an computational domain of fixed geometry, while the PINN is trained for a geometrical variation of the domain. The TL workflow is first applied to Poisson's equation on different 2D domains and then to a 2D quadrupole magnet model. Comparisons against randomly initialized PINNs reveal that the performance of TL is ultimately dependent on the type of geometry variation considered, leading to significantly improved convergence rates and training times for some variations, but also to no improvement or even to performance deterioration in other cases.">

However, since they make use of neural networks, they provide only a point estimate of differential equation parameters, as well as the solution at any given point, without any measure of uncertainty. Ensemble and Bayesian methods have been previously applied to quantify the uncertainty of PINNs, but these methods may require making strong assumptions on the data-generating process, and can be computationally expensive. Here, we introduce Conformalized PINNs (C-PINNs) that, without making any additional assumptions, utilize the framework of conformal prediction to quantify the uncertainty of PINNs by providing intervals that have finite-sample, distribution-free statistical validity.">

Neural operators are neural networks that learn a mapping from the parameter space to the solution space of PDEs from data, and they can also solve the inverse problem of estimating the parameter from the solution. Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

        <tr id="Machine learning is increasingly employed in engineering, with one of its primary applications being the construction of surrogate models to replace computationally expensive physical models for analysis and design, especially control co-design which integrates physical and control system design. In cases where generating labels for training through physical models is computationally intensive, label-free machine learning offers a viable alternative. However, surrogate models built from label-free machine learning typically have prediction errors, which can be characterized and quantified through epistemic uncertainty, representing model-form uncertainty. Moreover, when these surrogate models are used in optimization design for real-world applications, inherent random variables introduce aleatory uncertainty. This study introduces a robust design optimization method that addresses the intertwined epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. By optimizing both the average product performance and reducing uncertainty stemming from the coupled uncertainty, the method achieves improved robustness. A four-bar linkage mechanism design serves as a demonstration of this approach. The surrogate model for the design is constructed using label-free neural network, accommodating a system of physical equations. The error of the surrogate model is assessed through Gaussian Process regression, using existing training points and derivatives of the physical equations at these points. The design of the four-bar linkage aims to minimize both its average motion error and the variability of the error attributed to coupled uncertainty.">

In this paper, we propose an inference methodology for classical Kirchhoff-Love plates via physics-informed Gaussian Processes (GP). A probabilistic model is formulated as a multi-output GP by placing a GP prior on the deflection and deriving the covariance function using the linear differential operators of the plate governing equations. The posteriors of the flexural rigidity, hyperparameters, and plate response are inferred in a Bayesian manner using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from noisy measurements. We demonstrate the applicability with two examples: a simply supported plate subjected to a sinusoidal load and a fixed plate subjected to a uniform load. The results illustrate how the proposed methodology can be employed to perform stochastic inference for plate rigidity and physical quantities by integrating measurements from various sensor types and qualities. Potential applications of the presented methodology are in structural health monitoring and uncertainty quantification of plate-like structures.">

The objective of this strategy is to assist the network in solving PDEs more effectively. During the RBF-assisted processing part, the method selects the center points and collocation points separately to effectively manage data size and computational complexity. Subsequently, the RBF processed data are put into the network for predicting the solutions to PDEs. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the novel method.

However, for complex problems, training these networks can still be challenging, often resulting in unsatisfactory accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that the failure of plain physics-informed neural networks arises from the significant discrepancy in the convergence speed of residuals at different training points, where the slowest convergence speed dominates the overall solution convergence. Based on these observations, we propose a point-wise adaptive weighting method that balances the residual decay rate across different training points. The performance of our proposed adaptive weighting method is compared with current state-of-the-art adaptive weighting methods on benchmark problems for both physics-informed neural networks and physics-informed deep operator networks. Through extensive numerical results we demonstrate that our proposed approach of balanced residual decay rates offers several advantages, including bounded weights, high prediction accuracy, fast convergence speed, low training uncertainty, low computational cost and ease of hyperparameter tuning.">

For example, classical fully-connected feed-forward NNs fail to approximate continuous functions whose gradient is discontinuous when employing strong formulations like in Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). In this article, we propose the use of regularity-conforming neural networks, where a priori information on the regularity of solutions to PDEs can be employed to construct proper architectures. We illustrate the potential of such architectures via a two-dimensional (2D) transmission problem, where the solution may admit discontinuities in the gradient across interfaces, as well as power-like singularities at certain points. In particular, we formulate the weak transmission problem in a PINNs-like strong formulation with interface and continuity conditions. Such architectures are partially explainable; discontinuities are explicitly described, allowing the introduction of novel terms into the loss function. We demonstrate via several model problems in one and two dimensions the advantages of using regularity-conforming architectures in contrast to classical architectures. The ideas presented in this article easily extend to problems in higher dimensions.">

While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.">

Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing outputs and gradients of deep models to satisfy target equations. Due to the limitation of numerical computation, PINNs are conventionally optimized on finite selected points. However, since PDEs are usually defined on continuous domains, solely optimizing models on scattered points may be insufficient to obtain an accurate solution for the whole domain. To mitigate this inherent deficiency of the default scatter-point optimization, this paper proposes and theoretically studies a new training paradigm as region optimization. Concretely, we propose to extend the optimization process of PINNs from isolated points to their continuous neighborhood regions, which can theoretically decrease the generalization error, especially for hidden high-order constraints of PDEs. A practical training algorithm, Region Optimized PINN (RoPINN), is seamlessly derived from this new paradigm, which is implemented by a straightforward but effective Monte Carlo sampling method. By calibrating the sampling process into trust regions, RoPINN finely balances sampling efficiency and generalization error. Experimentally, RoPINN consistently boosts the performance of diverse PINNs on a wide range of PDEs without extra backpropagation or gradient calculation.">

Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.">

        <tr id="This paper is aimed at using the newly developing field of physics informed machine learning (PIML) to develop models for predicting the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) aircraft engines. We consider the well-known benchmark NASA Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) data as the main data for this paper, which consists of sensor outputs in a variety of different operating modes. C-MAPSS is a well-studied dataset with much existing work in the literature that address RUL prediction with classical and deep learning methods. In the absence of published empirical physical laws governing the C-MAPSS data, our approach first uses stochastic methods to estimate the governing physics models from the noisy time series data. In our approach, we model the various sensor readings as being governed by stochastic differential equations, and we estimate the corresponding transition density mean and variance functions of the underlying processes. We then augment LSTM (long-short term memory) models with the learned mean and variance functions during training and inferencing. Our PIML based approach is different from previous methods, and we use the data to first learn the physics. Our results indicate that PIML discovery and solutions methods are well suited for this problem and outperform previous data-only deep learning methods for this data set and task. Moreover, the framework developed herein is flexible, and can be adapted to other situations (other sensor modalities or combined multi-physics environments), including cases where the underlying physics is only partially observed or known.">

        <tr id="In recent years, surrogate models based on deep neural networks have been widely used to solve partial differential equations for fluid flow physics. This kind of model focuses on global interpolation of the training data and thus requires a large network structure. The process is both time consuming and computationally costly. In the present study, we develop a neural network with local converging input (NNLCI) for high-fidelity prediction using unstructured data. The framework uses the local domain of dependence with converging coarse solutions as input, thereby greatly reducing computational resource and training time. As a validation case, the NNLCI method is applied to study two-dimensional inviscid supersonic flows in channels with bumps. Different bump geometries and locations are examined to benchmark the effectiveness and versatility of this new approach. The NNLCI method can accurately and efficiently capture the structure and dynamics of the entire flowfield, including regions with shock discontinuities. For a new bump configuration, the method can perform prediction with only one neural network, eliminating the need for repeated training of multiple networks for different geometries. A saving of computing wall time is achieved by several orders of magnitude against the high-fidelity simulation with the same level of accuracy. The demand on training data is modest, and the training data can be allocated sparsely. These features are especially advantageous compared with conventional global-to-global deep learning methods and physics-informed methods.">

To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.">

While computational fluid dynamics is precise, it is computationally impractical for real-time control. Lumped thermal models divide the room into cells and explicitly model inter-cell air-mixing. However, solving the coupled differential equations is still computationally challenging. Data-driven methods like long-short term memory may handle non-linear thermal dynamics but face limitations in observability, adherence to physical constraints, and generalization. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) impose physical constraints even while learning from data. However, PINNs still lack the scalability required for effective control in large open-plan offices, primarily due to air-mixing interactions Our approach, PhyGICS, combines graph neural networks with physics-informed learning (PI-GNN) to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we model the thermodynamic interactions as edges between nodes that represent cells. Further, the modeling approach allows explicit modeling of wall and window surface temperatures that are commonly ignored. PhyGICS, utilizing PI-GNN as a state-estimator, employs a receding-horizon approach for optimal HVAC control. We adapt PI-GNNs for building HVAC control by incorporating a time-resetting strategy to handle time-dependent ambient conditions and therefore set-points. Evaluations in a simulated environment with real-world data show PhyGICS outperforms a regular PINN model and other baseline control strategies on: 1) thermal model accuracy; 2) computation time; 3) energy consumption; and 4) user comfort.">

Hitherto, it has been separately addressed by employing operator learning surrogates for field prediction while using simulation-based inference (and its variants) for statistical parameter determination. Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.">

Here, we present a novel deep learning framework to estimate the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the function of two-body interactions, thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.">

Altering loss functions or adding physics-based regularization (PBR) terms to reflect material properties informs a network about the physical constraints the simulation should obey. The training and tuning process of a DL network greatly affects the quality of the model, but how this process differs when using physics-based loss functions or regularization terms is not commonly discussed. In this manuscript, several PBR methods are implemented to enforce stress equilibrium on a network predicting the stress fields of a high elastic contrast composite. Models with PBR enforced the equilibrium constraint more accurately than a model without PBR, and the stress equilibrium converged more quickly. More importantly, it was observed that independently fine-tuning each implementation resulted in more accurate models. More specifically, each loss formulation and dataset required different learning rates and loss weights for the best performance. This result has important implications on assessing the relative effectiveness of different DL models and highlights important considerations when making a comparison between DL methods.">

        <tr id="Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve the PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a specific set of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation or a finite set of coefficients. This bottleneck limits the generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major advantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a Transformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable generalizability and scalability.">

We demonstrate through numerical results that, relying on the derived algorithm to identify the inertia tensor of a nanosatellite, we can achieve improved estimation accuracy and robustness, by integrating physical constraints and leveraging partial knowledge of the system dynamics.

For example, an initial condition can be mapped to the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) at a future time-step using a neural operator. Despite the popularity of neural operators, their use to predict solution functions over a domain given only data over the boundary (such as a spatially varying Dirichlet boundary condition) remains unexplored. In this paper, we refer to such problems as boundary-to-domain problems; they have a wide range of applications in areas such as fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, heat transfer etc. We present a novel FNO-based architecture, named Lifting Product FNO (or LP-FNO) which can map arbitrary boundary functions defined on the lower-dimensional boundary to a solution in the entire domain. Specifically, two FNOs defined on the lower-dimensional boundary are lifted into the higher dimensional domain using our proposed lifting product layer.

        <tr id="Physics-guided neural networks (PGNN) is an effective tool that combines the benefits of data-driven modeling with the interpretability and generalization of underlying physical information. However, for a classical PGNN, the penalization of the physics-guided part is at the output level, which leads to a conservative result as systems with highly similar state-transition functions, i.e. only slight differences in parameters, can have significantly different time-series outputs. Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.">

        <tr id="We propose physics-informed holomorphic neural networks (PIHNNs) as a method to solve boundary value problems where the solution can be represented via holomorphic functions. Specifically, we consider the case of plane linear elasticity and, by leveraging the Kolosov-Muskhelishvili representation of the solution in terms of holomorphic potentials, we train a complex-valued neural network to fulfill stress and displacement boundary conditions while automatically satisfying the governing equations. This is achieved by designing the network to return only approximations that inherently satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions through specific choices of layers and activation functions. To ensure generality, we provide a universal approximation theorem guaranteeing that, under basic assumptions, the proposed holomorphic neural networks can approximate any holomorphic function. Furthermore, we suggest a new tailored weight initialization technique to mitigate the issue of vanishing/exploding gradients. Compared to the standard PINN approach, noteworthy benefits of the proposed method for the linear elasticity problem include a more efficient training, as evaluations are needed solely on the boundary of the domain, lower memory requirements, due to the reduced number of training points, and $C^\infty$ regularity of the learned solution. Several benchmark examples are used to verify the correctness of the obtained PIHNN approximations, the substantial benefits over traditional PINNs, and the possibility to deal with non-trivial, multiply-connected geometries via a domain-decomposition strategy.">

        <tr id="We present ConDiff, a novel dataset for scientific machine learning. ConDiff focuses on the diffusion equation with varying coefficients, a fundamental problem in many applications of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). The main novelty of the proposed dataset is that we consider discontinuous coefficients with high contrast. These coefficient functions are sampled from a selected set of distributions. This class of problems is not only of great academic interest, but is also the basis for describing various environmental and industrial problems. In this way, ConDiff shortens the gap with real-world problems while remaining fully synthetic and easy to use. ConDiff consists of a diverse set of diffusion equations with coefficients covering a wide range of contrast levels and heterogeneity with a measurable complexity metric for clearer comparison between different coefficient functions. We baseline ConDiff on standard deep learning models in the field of scientific machine learning. By providing a large number of problem instances, each with its own coefficient function and right-hand side, we hope to encourage the development of novel physics-based deep learning approaches, such as neural operators and physics-informed neural networks, ultimately driving progress towards more accurate and efficient solutions of complex PDE problems.">

The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions.

        <tr id="We extend a recently proposed machine-learning-based iterative solver, i.e. the hybrid iterative transferable solver (HINTS), to solve the scattering problem described by the Helmholtz equation in an exterior domain with a complex absorbing boundary condition. The HINTS method combines neural operators (NOs) with standard iterative solvers, e.g. Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel (GS), to achieve better performance by leveraging the spectral bias of neural networks. In HINTS, some iterations of the conventional iterative method are replaced by inferences of the pre-trained NO. In this work, we employ HINTS to solve the scattering problem for both 2D and 3D problems, where the standard iterative solver fails. We consider square and triangular scatterers of various sizes in 2D, and a cube and a model submarine in 3D. We explore and illustrate the extrapolation capability of HINTS in handling diverse geometries of the scatterer, which is achieved by training the NO on non-scattering scenarios and then deploying it in HINTS to solve scattering problems. The accurate results demonstrate that the NO in HINTS method remains effective without retraining or fine-tuning it whenever a new scatterer is given. Taken together, our results highlight the adaptability and versatility of the extended HINTS methodology in addressing diverse scattering problems.">

        <tr id="Bayesian inversion is central to the quantification of uncertainty within problems arising from numerous applications in science and engineering. To formulate the approach, four ingredients are required: a forward model mapping the unknown parameter to an element of a solution space, often the solution space for a differential equation; an observation operator mapping an element of the solution space to the data space; a noise model describing how noise pollutes the observations; and a prior model describing knowledge about the unknown parameter before the data is acquired. This paper is concerned with learning the prior model from data; in particular, learning the prior from multiple realizations of indirect data obtained through the noisy observation process. The prior is represented, using a generative model, as the pushforward of a Gaussian in a latent space; the pushforward map is learned by minimizing an appropriate loss function. A metric that is well-defined under empirical approximation is used to define the loss function for the pushforward map to make an implementable methodology. Furthermore, an efficient residual-based neural operator approximation of the forward model is proposed and it is shown that this may be learned concurrently with the pushforward map, using a bilevel optimization formulation of the problem; this use of neural operator approximation has the potential to make prior learning from indirect data more computationally efficient, especially when the observation process is expensive, non-smooth or not known. The ideas are illustrated with the Darcy flow inverse problem of finding permeability from piezometric head measurements.">

        <tr id="Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a principled framework for modeling uncertainty in deep learning tasks. However, conventional BNNs often suffer from high computational complexity and parameter overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed Probabilistic BNN (ProbBNN), which leverages probabilistic computing principles to streamline the inference process. Unlike traditional deterministic approaches, ProbBNN represents inputs and parameters as random variables governed by probability distributions, allowing for the propagation of uncertainty throughout the network. We employ Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to represent the parameters of each neuron or convolutional kernel, enabling efficient encoding and processing of uncertainty. Our approach simplifies the inference process by replacing complex deterministic computations with lightweight probabilistic operations, resulting in reduced computational complexity and improved scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbBNN in achieving competitive accuracy to traditional BNNs while significantly reducing the number of parameters. The transition to ProbBNN yields a reduction of two orders of magnitude in the number of parameters compared to baseline approaches, making our approach promising for deployment in resource-constrained applications such as edge computing and IoT devices.">

These additions have the aim of reintroducing contributions that in standard ROMs are not taken into account.

Both approaches have been investigated in previous works and the goal of this paper is to extend the model to a parametric setting making use of ad-hoc machine learning procedures. More in detail, we investigate different neural networks' architectures, from simple dense feed-forward to Long-Short Term Memory neural networks, in order to find the most suitable model for the re-introduced contributions. We tested the methods on two test cases with different behaviors: the periodic turbulent flow past a circular cylinder and the unsteady turbulent flow in a channel-driven cavity. In both cases, the parameter considered is the Reynolds number and the machine learning-enhanced ROM considerably improved the pressure and velocity accuracy with respect to the standard ROM.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces scour physics-informed neural networks (SPINNs), a hybrid physics-data-driven framework for bridge scour prediction using deep learning. SPINNs are developed based on historical scour monitoring data and integrate physics-based empirical equations into neural networks as supplementary loss components. We incorporated three architectures: LSTM, CNN, and NLinear as the base data-driven model. Despite varying performance across different base models and bridges, SPINNs overall outperformed pure data-driven models. In some bridge cases, SPINN reduced forecasting errors by up to 50 percent. In this study, we also explored general models for bridge clusters, trained by aggregating datasets across multiple bridges in a region. The pure data-driven models mostly benefited from this approach, in particular bridges with limited data. However, bridge-specific SPINNs provided more accurate predictions than general SPINNs for almost all case studies. Also, the time-dependent empirical equations derived from SPINNs showed reasonable accuracy in estimating maximum scour depth, providing more accurate predictions compared to HEC-18. Comparing both SPINNs and pure deep learning models with traditional HEC-18 equation indicates substantial improvements in scour prediction accuracy. This study can pave the way for hybrid physics-machine learning methodologies to be implemented for bridge scour design and maintenance.">

Theoretically, we prove the universal approximation capability of CoNO. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of CoNO on seven challenging partial differential equations (PDEs), including regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds. Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data.

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

In several challenging, high-dimensional numerical examples, we demonstrate the superiority of NWoS in accuracy, speed, and computational costs. Compared to commonly used PINNs, our approach can reduce memory usage and errors by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we apply NWoS to problems in PDE-constrained optimization and molecular dynamics to show its efficiency in practical applications.">

        <tr id="The physics-informed neural network (PINN) can recover partial differential equation (PDE) coefficients that remain constant throughout the spatial domain directly from measurements. We propose a spatially dependent physics-informed neural network (SD-PINN), which enables recovering coefficients in spatially dependent PDEs using one neural network, eliminating the requirement for domain-specific physical expertise. The network is trained by minimizing a combination of loss functions involving data-fitting and physical constraints, in which the requirement for satisfying the assumed governing PDE is encoded. For the recovery of spatially two-dimensional (2D) PDEs, we store the PDE coefficients at all locations in the 2D region of interest into a matrix and incorporate a low-rank assumption for this matrix to recover the coefficients at locations without measurements. We apply the SD-PINN to recovering spatially dependent coefficients of the wave equation to reveal the spatial distribution of acoustic properties in the inhomogeneous medium.">

        <tr id="Machine learning techniques are being used as an alternative to traditional numerical discretization methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to fluid flow. Whilst numerical methods are higher fidelity, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning methods on the other hand are lower fidelity but provide significant speed-ups. The emergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in fluid dynamics has allowed scientists to directly use PDEs for evaluating loss functions in an unsupervised manner. The downfall of this approach is that the differential form of systems is invalid at regions of shock inherent in hyperbolic PDEs such as the compressible Euler equations. To circumvent this problem we propose a modification to PDE-based PINN losses by using a finite volume-based loss function that incorporates the flux of Godunov-type methods. These Godunov-type methods are also known as approximate Riemann solvers and evaluate intercell fluxes in an entropy-satisfying manner, yielding more physically accurate shocks. Our approach increases fidelity compared to using regularized PDE-based PINN losses, as tested on the 2D Riemann problem.">

Here we uncover a connection between operator learning architectures and conditioned neural fields from computer vision, providing a unified perspective for examining differences between popular operator learning models. We find that many commonly used operator learning models can be viewed as neural fields with conditioning mechanisms restricted to point-wise and/or global information. Motivated by this, we propose the Continuous Vision Transformer (CViT), a novel neural operator architecture that employs a vision transformer encoder and uses cross-attention to modulate a base field constructed with a trainable grid-based positional encoding of query coordinates. Despite its simplicity, CViT achieves state-of-the-art results across challenging benchmarks in climate modeling and fluid dynamics.

        <tr id="Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change. Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of ~40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations. These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections. Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on computationally expensive, short high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard. However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation. We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training. First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered. Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features. We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore, removing spurious non-physical relationships. This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of standard black-box DL-based parameterizations. Our framework represents a crucial step in addressing a major challenge in data-driven climate model parameterizations by respecting the underlying physical processes, and may also benefit physically consistent deep learning in other research fields.">

        <tr id="Port-Hamiltonian systems (pHS) allow for a structure-preserving modeling of dynamical systems. Coupling pHS via linear relations between input and output defines an overall pHS, which is structure preserving. However, in multiphysics applications, some subsystems do not allow for a physical pHS description, as (a) this is not available or (b) too expensive. Here, data-driven approaches can be used to deliver a pHS for such subsystems, which can then be coupled to the other subsystems in a structure-preserving way. In this work, we derive a data-driven identification approach for port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The approach uses input and state space data to estimate nonlinear effort functions of pH-DAEs. As underlying technique, we us (multi-task) Gaussian processes. This work thereby extends over the current state of the art, in which only port-Hamiltonian ordinary differential equation systems could be identified via Gaussian processes. We apply this approach successfully to two applications from network design and constrained multibody system dynamics, based on pH-DAE system of index one and three, respectively.">

        <tr id="Data-driven deep learning has emerged as the new paradigm to model complex physical space-time systems. These data-driven methods learn patterns by optimizing statistical metrics and tend to overlook the adherence to physical laws, unlike traditional model-driven numerical methods. Thus, they often generate predictions that are not physically realistic. On the other hand, by sampling a large amount of high quality predictions from a data-driven model, some predictions will be more physically plausible than the others and closer to what will happen in the future. Based on this observation, we propose \emph{Beam search by Vector Quantization} (BeamVQ) to enhance the physical alignment of data-driven space-time forecasting models. The key of BeamVQ is to train model on self-generated samples filtered with physics-aware metrics. To be flexibly support different backbone architectures, BeamVQ leverages a code bank to transform any encoder-decoder model to the continuous state space into discrete codes. Afterwards, it iteratively employs beam search to sample high-quality sequences, retains those with the highest physics-aware scores, and trains model on the new dataset. Comprehensive experiments show that BeamVQ not only gave an average statistical skill score boost for more than 32% for ten backbones on five datasets, but also significantly enhances physics-aware metrics.">

It has been showcased that a combination of optimization techniques extended and adapted from the PINNs literature, and the introduction of specific techniques inspired by the MPF Method background, is required. The numerical resolution is realized through a multi-variable time-series problem by using fully discrete resolution. Within each interval, space, time, and phases are treated separately, constituting discrete subdomains. An extended multi-networking concept is implemented to subdivide the simulation domain into multiple batches, with each batch associated with an independent Neural Network trained to predict the solution. To ensure efficient interaction across different phasesand in the spatio-temporal-phasic subdomain, a Master NN handles efficient interaction among the multiple networks, as well as the transfer of learning in different directions. A set of systematic simulations with increasing complexity was performed, that benchmarks various critical aspects of MPF simulations, including different geometries, types of interface dynamics and the evolution of an interfacial triple junction. A comprehensive approach is adopted to specifically focus the attention on the interfacial regions through an automatic and dynamic meshing process, significantly simplifying the tuning of hyper-parameters and serving as a fundamental key for addressing MPF problems using Machine Learning. The pyramidal training approach is proposed to the PINN community as a dual-impact method: it facilitates the initialization of training and allows an extended transfer of learning. The proposed PINNs-MPF framework successfully reproduces benchmark tests with high fidelity and Mean Squared Error loss values ranging from 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ compared to ground truth solutions.">

Existing analytical and numerical methods do not always provide efficient solutions for such problems. Recently, neural networks have been successfully applied to solve PDEs, typically addressing boundary value problems for domains with simple shapes. This paper attempts to construct a neural network capable of effectively solving boundary value problems for domains of complex shapes.Materials and Methods. A method for constructing a neural network to solve the Dirichlet problem for regions of complex shape is proposed. Derivatives of singular solutions of the Laplace equation are accepted as activation functions. Singular points of these solutions are distributed along closed curves encompassing the boundary of the domain. The adjustment of the network weights is reduced to minimizing the root-mean-square error during training.Results. The results of solving Dirichlet problems for various complex-shaped domains are presented. The results are provided in tables, comparing the exact solution and the solution obtained using the neural network. Figures show the domain shapes and the locations of points where the solutions were determined.Discussion and Conclusion. The presented results indicate a good agreement between the obtained solution and the exact one. It is noted that this method can be easily applied to various boundary value problems. Methods for enhancing the efficiency of such neural networks are suggested.">

        <tr id="Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a methodology for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network. It presets the weight/bias coefficients in the hidden layer with random values, which remain fixed throughout the computation, and uses a linear least squares method for training the parameters of the output layer of the neural network. It is known to be much faster than Physics informed neural networks. However, classical ELM is still computationally expensive when a high level of representation is desired in the solution as this requires solving a large least squares system. In this paper, we propose a nonoverlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) for ELMs that not only reduces the training time of ELMs, but is also suitable for parallel computation. In numerical analysis, DDMs have been widely studied to reduce the time to obtain finite element solutions for elliptic PDEs through parallel computation. Among these approaches, nonoverlapping DDMs are attracting the most attention. Motivated by these methods, we introduce local neural networks, which are valid only at corresponding subdomains, and an auxiliary variable at the interface. We construct a system on the variable and the parameters of local neural networks. A Schur complement system on the interface can be derived by eliminating the parameters of the output layer. The auxiliary variable is then directly obtained by solving the reduced system after which the parameters for each local neural network are solved in parallel. A method for initializing the hidden layer parameters suitable for high approximation quality in large systems is also proposed. Numerical results that verify the acceleration performance of the proposed method with respect to the number of subdomains are presented.">

We perform projected gradient descent(PDG) to train the three-layer network and we establish its global convergence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a comprehensive error analysis of using overparameterized networks to solve PDE problems, as our analysis simultaneously includes estimates for approximation error, generalization error, and optimization error. We present error bound in terms of the sample size $n$ and our work provides guidance on how to set the network depth, width, step size, and number of iterations for the projected gradient descent algorithm. Importantly, our assumptions in this work are classical and we do not require any additional assumptions on the solution of the equation.

        <tr id="Utilizing machine learning to address partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges due to the diversity of spatial domains and their corresponding state configurations, which complicates the task of encompassing all potential scenarios through data-driven methodologies alone. Moreover, there are legitimate concerns regarding the generalization and reliability of such approaches, as they often overlook inherent physical constraints. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel machine-learning architecture that is highly generalizable and adheres to conservation laws and physical symmetries, thereby ensuring greater reliability. The foundation of this architecture is graph neural networks (GNNs), which are adept at accommodating a variety of shapes and forms. Additionally, we explore the parallels between GNNs and traditional numerical solvers, facilitating a seamless integration of conservative principles and symmetries into machine learning models. Our findings from experiments demonstrate that the model's inclusion of physical laws significantly enhances its generalizability, i.e., no significant accuracy degradation for unseen spatial domains while other models degrade.

        <tr id="Finding self-similarity is a key step for understanding the governing law behind complex physical phenomena. Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

In the online structural health monitoring framework, surrogate modeling aims to approximate the predictions of the underlying high-fidelity model to facilitate fast simulations. Generally, conventional machine learning techniques based on purely data-driven approaches often behave as black boxes, producing predictions that may lack physical consistency. In an effort to overcome these limitations, we proposed a neural network mapping constrained by the known physical relationships of an engineering model, which can be considered as a physics-informed inductive bias. This approach aims to enhance computational efficiency while reducing the required number of training examples. The physics-informed term guides the training process to yield predictions that exhibit greater physical consistency while maintaining high performance. 
We here propose a surrogate modeling approach relying on a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) scheme, which is designed to enable robust and real-time monitoring of ballistic impact damage on a rotor shaft. At first, a high fidelity finite element model is developed to simulate the response of the rotor shaft under various operational conditions. As a first reduction step, substructuring is used to decrease the dimensionality of the system's matrices, thereby reducing the computational cost. For comparison and validation, an alternative model based on the Timoshenko beam theory is utilized. Both models examine the effects of impact-induced vibration loads due to ballistic occurrences. The PINN model receives the external load as input and predicts the system's response. The system matrices extracted from both models constitute the physics-informed term. This term is incorporated into the PINN architecture in order to steer the learning process towards more physically consistent and reliable predictions regarding the state and the response of the structure. The algorithm's performance is evaluated using response data derived from both models.

In terms of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) based additive manufacturing (AM), a DT can predict the current and future states of the melt pool and the resulting defects corresponding to the input laser parameters, evolve itself by assimilating in-situ sensor data, and optimize the laser parameters to mitigate defect formation. In this paper, we present a deep neural operator enabled computational framework of the DT for closed-loop feedback control of the L-PBF process. This is accomplished by building a high-fidelity computational model to accurately represent the melt pool states, an efficient surrogate model to approximate the melt pool solution field, followed by an physics-based procedure to extract information from the computed melt pool simulation that can further be correlated to the defect quantities of interest (e.g., surface roughness). In particular, we leverage the data generated from the high-fidelity physics-based model and train a series of Fourier neural operator (FNO) based ML models to effectively learn the relation between the input laser parameters and the corresponding full temperature field of the melt pool. Subsequently, a set of physics-informed variables such as the melt pool dimensions and the peak temperature can be extracted to compute the resulting defects. An optimization algorithm is then exercised to control laser input and minimize defects. On the other hand, the constructed DT can also evolve with the physical twin via offline finetuning and online material calibration. Finally, a probabilistic framework is adopted for uncertainty quantification. The developed DT is envisioned to guide the AM process and facilitate high-quality manufacturing.">

Recent advances attempt to incorporate prior physical knowledge into the deep learning framework to estimate the unknown governing partial differential equations (PDEs), which have shown promising results in spatiotemporal prediction tasks. However, previous approaches only restrict neural network architectures or loss functions to acquire physical or PDE features, which decreases the representative capacity of a neural network. Meanwhile, the updating process of the physical state cannot be effectively estimated. To solve the above mentioned problems, this paper proposes a physical-guided neural network, which utilizes the frequency-enhanced Fourier module and moment loss to strengthen the model's ability to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive second-order Runge-Kutta method with physical constraints to model the physical states more precisely. We evaluate our model on both spatiotemporal and video prediction tasks. The experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and performs best in several datasets, with a much smaller parameter count.">

Nonetheless, difficulties in generalization and limitations in accuracy have hindered their broader utility and applicability. In this work, we use a paired autoencoder framework as a likelihood-free estimator for inverse problems. We show that the use of such an architecture allows us to construct a solution efficiently and to overcome some known open problems when using likelihood-free estimators. In particular, our framework can assess the quality of the solution and improve on it if needed.

        <tr id="Predicting cancer dynamics under treatment is challenging due to high inter-patient heterogeneity, lack of predictive biomarkers, and sparse and noisy longitudinal data. Mathematical models can summarize cancer dynamics by a few interpretable parameters per patient. Machine learning methods can then be trained to predict the model parameters from baseline covariates, but do not account for uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Instead, hierarchical Bayesian modeling can model the relationship between baseline covariates to longitudinal measurements via mechanistic parameters while accounting for uncertainty in every part of the model. The mapping from baseline covariates to model parameters can be modeled in several ways. A linear mapping simplifies inference but fails to capture nonlinear covariate effects and scale poorly for interaction modeling when the number of covariates is large. In contrast, Bayesian neural networks can potentially discover interactions between covariates automatically, but at a substantial cost in computational complexity. In this work, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of subpopulation dynamics that uses baseline covariate information to predict cancer dynamics under treatment, inspired by cancer dynamics in multiple myeloma (MM), where serum M protein is a well-known proxy of tumor burden. As a working example, we apply the model to a simulated dataset and compare its ability to predict M protein trajectories to a model with linear covariate effects. Our results show that the Bayesian neural network covariate effect model predicts cancer dynamics more accurately than a linear covariate effect model when covariate interactions are present. The framework can also be applied to other types of cancer or other time series prediction problems that can be described with a parametric model.">

We also introduce a fast and practical way to incorporate and combine all sources of errors for the first time. For illustration, the new method is applied to quantify errors in cloud autoconversion rates, predicted from an artificial neural network that was trained by aircraft cloud probe measurements in the Azores and the stochastic collection equation formulated as a two-moment bin model. For this specific example, the output uncertainty arising from uncertainty in the training and testing data is dominant, followed by uncertainty in the input data, in the trained neural network, and uncertainty in the weights.

 The rotating assemblies of critical machinery are complex dynamical systems and rotordynamic model response prediction inaccuracy risks machinery failure leading to high production losses. Jeffcott, Euler beam, and high-fidelity 3D solid finite element models are frequently utilized for rotordynamic analyses. Even though the 3D rotor has the higher accuracy, beam models are still widely used in industrial applications. To improve prediction accuracy of the lower fidelity Jeffcott and beam models a Rotordynamics Physics Informed Neural Network (R-PINN) is proposed. This models physics-informed Long Short-Term Memory LSTM neural networks which utilize partial or limited measured data, by incorporating physical laws. This approach enables the creation of a Digital Twin, which can produce additional data, and helps remove noise and outliers. In the current study, two R-PINNs are introduced to validate the superior capability of the model for both low and high-fidelity physics. Random noise of 10% is introduced into the measured data produced by the Digital Twin to replicate real-world noisy measurements. The result shows that both low and high-fidelity physics R-PINNs can achieve high accuracy even with high noise data, thereby increasing the robustness of the model. The results clearly demonstrate the ability of the proposed R-PINN algorithm to enhance an Euler beam model's predicted response to the level of accuracy of a 3D solid element model's predicted response, the latter acting as a surrogate for test measurements in an actual application.">

The inversion is computationally demanding because we are required to solve multiple forward problems, either in time or frequency domains, to simulate data that are then iteratively fitted to the observed data. We consider FWI in the frequency domain, where the Helmholtz equation is used as a forward model, and its repeated solution is the main computational bottleneck of the inversion process. To ease this cost, we integrate a learning process of an encoder-solver preconditioner that is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The encoder-solver is trained to effectively precondition the discretized Helmholtz operator given velocity medium parameters. Then, by re-training the CNN between the iterations of the optimization process, the encoder-solver is adapted to the iteratively evolving velocity medium as part of the inversion. Without retraining, the performance of the solver deteriorates as the medium changes. Using our light retraining procedures, we obtain the forward simulations effectively throughout the process. We demonstrate our approach to solving FWI problems using 2D geophysical models with high-frequency data.">

        <tr id="There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.">

In this paper, we provide convergence analysis for the implicit gradient descent for training over-parametrized two-layer PINNs. We first demonstrate the positive definiteness of Gram matrices for general smooth activation functions, like sigmoidal function, softplus function, tanh function and so on. Then the over-parameterization allows us to show that the randomly initialized IGD converges a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate. Moreover, due to the different training dynamics, the learning rate of IGD can be chosen independent of the sample size and the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix.">

Hitherto, deep learning-based methods employed to model hysteresis, face challenges in generalizing to novel input magnetic fields. This paper addresses the generalization challenge by proposing neural operators for modeling constitutive laws that exhibit magnetic hysteresis by learning a mapping between magnetic fields. In particular, two prominent neural operators -- deep operator network and Fourier neural operator -- are employed to predict novel first-order reversal curves and minor loops, where novel means they are not used to train the model. In addition, a rate-independent Fourier neural operator is proposed to predict material responses at sampling rates different from those used during training to incorporate the rate-independent characteristics of magnetic hysteresis. The presented numerical experiments demonstrate that neural operators efficiently model magnetic hysteresis, outperforming the traditional neural recurrent methods on various metrics and generalizing to novel magnetic fields. The findings emphasize the advantages of using neural operators for modeling hysteresis under varying magnetic conditions, underscoring their importance in characterizing magnetic material based devices.">

Such problems range from weather prediction to the analysis of disease propagation and video prediction. Modern techniques for the solution of these problems typically combine Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) architecture with a time prediction mechanism. However, oftentimes, such approaches underperform in the long-range propagation of information and lack explainability. In this work, we introduce a physically inspired architecture for the solution of such problems. Namely, we propose to augment CNNs with advection by designing a novel semi-Lagrangian push operator. We show that the proposed operator allows for the non-local transformation of information compared with standard convolutional kernels. We then complement it with Reaction and Diffusion neural components to form a network that mimics the Reaction-Advection-Diffusion equation, in high dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our network on a number of spatio-temporal datasets that show their merit.">

Although benefiting from favourable properties of NeFs such as grid-agnosticity and space-time-continuous dynamics modelling, this approach limits the ability to impose known constraints of the PDE on the solutions -- e.g. symmetries or boundary conditions -- in favour of modelling flexibility. Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.">

Fusing known physics into data-driven learners allows modelling practitioners to combine the expressive power of traditional machine learning with known mechanistic laws, where the objective is to enhance predictive performance, interpretability, and model generalisation. A core consideration that must be made when implementing a physics-informed learning architecture is how relevant knowledge will be embedded into the model structure, which, generally, is informed by the type of physics that is available. Frequently this knowledge may not be complete, with only a partial understanding of the governing physics available. 

In this work, possible paths for deriving Gaussian process kernels that are representative of partial knowledge will be considered. How the type of knowledge that is possessed influences the derivation will be explored, particularly when there is the potential for some aspect of misspecified physics. An example of deriving partially structured kernels will be investigated for modelling the decoupled response of a GARTEUR laboratory aircraft structure, where the derived kernels are used to decompose the dynamics of the aircraft into modal contributions.

We argue that residual is, at best, an indirect measure of the error of approximate solution and propose to train with error majorant instead. Since error majorant provides a direct upper bound on error, one can reliably estimate how close PiNN is to the exact solution and stop the optimization process when the desired accuracy is reached. We call loss function associated with error majorant $\textbf{Astral}$: neur$\textbf{A}$l a po$\textbf{ST}$erio$\textbf{RI}$ function$\textbf{A}$l Loss. To compare Astral and residual loss functions, we illustrate how error majorants can be derived for various PDEs and conduct experiments with diffusion equations (including anisotropic and in the L-shaped domain), convection-diffusion equation, temporal discretization of Maxwell's equation, and magnetostatics problem. The results indicate that Astral loss is competitive to the residual loss, typically leading to faster convergence and lower error (e.g., for Maxwell's equations, we observe an order of magnitude better relative error and training time). We also report that the error estimate obtained with Astral loss is usually tight enough to be informative, e.g., for a highly anisotropic equation, on average, Astral overestimates error by a factor of $1.5$, and for convection-diffusion by a factor of $1.7$.">

        <tr id="A key property of neural networks driving their success is their ability to learn features from data. Understanding feature learning from a theoretical viewpoint is an emerging field with many open questions. In this work we capture finite-width effects with a systematic theory of network kernels in deep non-linear neural networks. We show that the Bayesian prior of the network can be written in closed form as a superposition of Gaussian processes, whose kernels are distributed with a variance that depends inversely on the network width N . A large deviation approach, which is exact in the proportional limit for the number of data points $P = \alpha N \rightarrow \infty$, yields a pair of forward-backward equations for the maximum a posteriori kernels in all layers at once. We study their solutions perturbatively to demonstrate how the backward propagation across layers aligns kernels with the target. An alternative field-theoretic formulation shows that kernel adaptation of the Bayesian posterior at finite-width results from fluctuations in the prior: larger fluctuations correspond to a more flexible network prior and thus enable stronger adaptation to data. We thus find a bridge between the classical edge-of-chaos NNGP theory and feature learning, exposing an intricate interplay between criticality, response functions, and feature scale.">

When analyzing non-Fourier thermoelastic problems, it was found that as the thermal relaxation time increases, the finite element solution will face convergence difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to use alternative methods to solve. This paper proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) based on the DeepXDE deep learning library to analyze thermoelastic problems, including classical thermoelastic problems, thermoelastic coupling problems, and generalized thermoelastic problems. The loss function is constructed based on equations, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. Unlike traditional data-driven methods, this approach does not rely on known solutions. By comparing with analytical and finite element solutions, the applicability and accuracy of the deep learning method have been validated, providing new insights for the study of thermoelastic problems.">

        <tr id="Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.">

Plasma simulations, in particular those applied to the study of ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ plasma discharges and technologies, such as Hall thrusters, require substantial computational resources in order to resolve the multidimentional dynamics that span across wide spatial and temporal scales. Although high-fidelity computational tools are available to simulate such systems over limited conditions and in highly simplified geometries, simulations of full-size systems and/or extensive parametric studies over many geometric configurations and under different physical conditions are computationally intractable with conventional numerical tools. Thus, scientific studies and industrially oriented modeling of plasma systems, including the important ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ technologies, stand to significantly benefit from reduced order modeling algorithms. We develop a model reduction scheme based upon a {\em Shallow REcurrent Decoder} (SHRED) architecture. The scheme uses a neural network for encoding limited sensor measurements in time (sequence-to-sequence encoding) to full state-space reconstructions via a decoder network. Based upon the theory of separation of variables, the SHRED architecture is capable of (i) reconstructing full spatio-temporal fields with as little as three point sensors, even the fields that are not measured with sensor feeds but that are in dynamic coupling with the measured field, and (ii) forecasting the future state of the system using neural network roll-outs from the trained time encoding model.">

 This study presents an efficient gradient-based production optimization method that uses a deep-learning-based proxy model for the prediction of state variables (such as pressures and saturations) and well outputs (such as bottomhole pressures and injection rates) to solve nonlinearly constrained optimization with geological uncertainty. The surrogate model is the Embed-to-control Observe (E2CO) deep-learning proxy model, consisting of four blocks of neural networks: encoder, transition, transition output, and decoder. The use of a transition output block in E2CO networks provides the capability of predicting reservoir system output directly from the input state variables without using any explicit well-model equations. The proxy model is coupled with a powerful stochastic-gradient-based line-search sequential quadratic programming (LS-SQP) workflow to handle robust production optimization in the presence of nonlinear state constraints. A portion of the SPE10 benchmark reservoir model with channelized heterogeneous permeability under waterflooding is used for demonstrating the prediction and optimization performances of the proposed E2CO-based framework. The results from this framework are directly and quantitatively compared with the ones simulated using a commercial high-fidelity reservoir simulator.">

        <tr id="Backpropagation is a cornerstone algorithm in training neural networks for supervised learning, which uses a gradient descent method to update network weights by minimizing the discrepancy between actual and desired outputs. Despite its pivotal role in propelling deep learning advancements, the biological plausibility of backpropagation is questioned due to its requirements for weight symmetry, global error computation, and dual-phase training. To address this long-standing challenge, many studies have endeavored to devise biologically plausible training algorithms. However, a fully biologically plausible algorithm for training multilayer neural networks remains elusive, and interpretations of biological plausibility vary among researchers. In this study, we establish criteria for biological plausibility that a desirable learning algorithm should meet. Using these criteria, we evaluate a range of existing algorithms considered to be biologically plausible, including Hebbian learning, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, feedback alignment, target propagation, predictive coding, forward-forward algorithm, perturbation learning, local losses, and energy-based learning. Additionally, we empirically evaluate these algorithms across diverse network architectures and datasets. We compare the feature representations learned by these algorithms with brain activity recorded by non-invasive devices under identical stimuli, aiming to identify which algorithm can most accurately replicate brain activity patterns. We are hopeful that this study could inspire the development of new biologically plausible algorithms for training multilayer networks, thereby fostering progress in both the fields of neuroscience and machine learning.">

Although several architectures exist for PINNs that work remarkably in practice, our theoretical understanding of their performances is somewhat limited. In this work, we study the behavior of a Bayesian PINN estimator of the solution of a PDE from $n$ independent noisy measurement of the solution. We focus on a class of equations that are linear in their parameters (with unknown coefficients $\theta_\star$). We show that when the partial differential equation admits a classical solution (say $u_\star$), differentiable to order $\beta$, the mean square error of the Bayesian posterior mean is at least of order $n^{-2\beta/(2\beta + d)}$. Furthermore, we establish a convergence rate of the linear coefficients of $\theta_\star$ depending on the order of the underlying differential operator. Last but not least, our theoretical results are validated through extensive simulations.">

Despite recent developments, complex phenomena such as high-Reynolds-number (high-[Formula: see text]) flow remain a modeling challenge without the use of high-fidelity inputs. In this study, a low-fidelity-influenced physics-informed neural network (LF-PINN) is proposed as a surrogate aerodynamic analysis model for inverse airfoil shape design at [Formula: see text]. The LF-PINN is developed in a hybrid approach using low-fidelity flowfields approximated from a viscous-inviscid coupled airfoil analysis tool (mfoil) and physics residuals from the steady, incompressible, two-dimensional Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. The approach is designed to alleviate offline computational costs by avoiding high-fidelity simulations and sustain predicting accuracy using corrections by the physics residuals. The LF-PINN is able to correct the low-fidelity flowfield quantities toward the ground truth, with a mean improvement of about 19% in pressure and about 5% in total velocity based on Euclidean distance comparisons. Evaluation of the airfoil surface pressure coefficient [Formula: see text] distributions shows corrections by the LF-PINN at the suction peak, which largely contributes to lifting forces. Inverse airfoil shape design is conducted using target [Formula: see text] distributions in the objective function, whereby the LF-PINN can approach the expected target shapes while reducing online computational time by at least an order of magnitude compared to direct airfoil analysis tools.">

However, the"black box"nature of most machine learning techniques poses significant interpretability challenges in improving turbulence models. This paper introduces a novel unit-constrained turbulence modeling framework using symbolic regression to overcome these challenges. The framework amends the constitutive equation of linear eddy viscosity models (LEVMs) by establishing explicit equations between the Reynolds stress deviation and mean flow quantities, thereby improving the LEVM model's predictive capability for large separated turbulence. Unit consistency constraints are applied to the symbolic expressions to ensure physical realizability. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to the separated flow over 2D periodic hills. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy and generalization capabilities of the learned turbulence model. Compared to the standard k-{\epsilon} model, the learned model exhibits significantly enhanced predictive accuracy for anisotropic Reynolds stresses and flow velocities. It also more accurately identifies flow separations and exhibits promising generalization capabilities across different flow geometries.">

However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.">

        <tr id="The study of effective connectivity (EC) is essential in understanding how the brain integrates and responds to various sensory inputs. Model-driven estimation of EC is a powerful approach that requires estimating global and local parameters of a generative model of neural activity. Insights gathered through this process can be used in various applications, such as studying neurodevelopmental disorders. However, accurately determining EC through generative models remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of brain dynamics and the inherent noise in neural recordings, e.g., in electroencephalography (EEG). Current model-driven methods to study EC are computationally complex and cannot scale to all brain regions as required by whole-brain analyses. To facilitate EC assessment, an inference algorithm must exhibit reliable prediction of parameters in the presence of noise. Further, the relationship between the model parameters and the neural recordings must be learnable. To progress toward these objectives, we benchmarked the performance of a Bi-LSTM model for parameter inference from the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) simulated EEG under various noise conditions. Additionally, our study explores how the JR-NMM reacts to changes in key biological parameters (i.e., sensitivity analysis) like synaptic gains and time constants, a crucial step in understanding the connection between neural mechanisms and observed brain activity. Our results indicate that we can predict the local JR-NMM parameters from EEG, supporting the feasibility of our deep-learning-based inference approach. In future work, we plan to extend this framework to estimate local and global parameters from real EEG in clinically relevant applications.">

        <tr id="Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated strong capabilities of representing high-dimensional, complex functional relations, and hence have been widely used to characterize complex constitutive relations for various types of materials, such as polycrystals, polymers, etc. However, to construct a reliable NN-based constitutive model, a considerable amount of data, i.e. stress-strain states along different loading paths is needed, which can be expensive to collect. To address such challenge, we develop a hybrid finite element method (FEM) - NN optimization framework to learn complex hyperelastic constitutive relations from full-field data. The key advantage of this framework is that it can make use of the non-uniform displacement field due to the geometric inhomogeneities for training NN-based constitutive models. Since such data can provide many different stress-strain states in a single test, it can greatly reduce the number of experiments needed for the training of NNs. Besides, we adopt a mechanics-informed neural network (MINN) as our architecture to ensure that our NN-based models satisfy all necessary physical constraints by construction, such as objectivity, material symmetry, polyconvexity, etc. Such architecture is also key to the convergence of our optimization framework. We then use both synthetic and experimental data to test the performance of our proposed framework on various isotropic hyperelastic materials. Results show that our optimization framework can be used to train NN-based constitutive models for hyperelastic materials with high accuracy and efficiency using data generated from simple tests, which can also be easily adapted to characterize complex constitutive models for a broader range of materials.">

However, this method is computationally intensive, as it makes repeated use of non-convex optimization that in turn requires numerical integration of the underlying system. Here, we propose the Gradient Matching GTS (GMGTS) method as an efficient alternative to GTS. Gradient matching offers an integration-free approach to parameter estimation that is particularly powerful for dynamical systems that are linear in the unknown parameters, such as biochemical networks modeled by mass action kinetics. Here, we harness the power of gradient matching by integrating it into the GTS framework. To this end, we significantly expand the capabilities of gradient matching via uncertainty propagation calculations and the development of an iterative estimation scheme for partially observed systems. Through comparisons of GMGTS with GTS in different inference setups, we demonstrate that our method provides a significant computational advantage, thereby facilitating the use of complex NLME models in systems biology applications.">

        <tr id="Dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (dPET) imaging and Time-Activity Curve (TAC) analyses are essential for understanding and quantifying the biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals over time and space. Traditional compartmental modeling, while foundational, commonly struggles to fully capture the complexities of biological systems, including non-linear dynamics and variability. This study introduces an innovative data-driven neural network-based framework, inspired by Reaction Diffusion systems, designed to address these limitations. Our approach, which adaptively fits TACs from dPET, enables the direct calibration of diffusion coefficients and reaction terms from observed data, offering significant improvements in predictive accuracy and robustness over traditional methods, especially in complex biological scenarios. By more accurately modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of radiopharmaceuticals, our method advances modeling of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes, enabling new possibilities in quantitative nuclear medicine.">

        <tr id="The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective technique to produce interpretable models of dynamical systems from time-resolved state data via sparse regression. However, to model parameterized systems, SINDy requires data from transient trajectories for various parameter values over the range of interest, which are typically difficult to acquire experimentally. In this work, we extend SINDy to be able to leverage data on fixed points and/or limit cycles to reduce the number of transient trajectories needed for successful system identification. To achieve this, we incorporate the data on these attractors at various parameter values as constraints in the optimization problem. First, we show that enforcing these as hard constraints leads to an ill-conditioned regression problem due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we implement soft constraints by modifying the cost function to be minimized. This leads to the formulation of a multi-objective sparse regression problem where we simultaneously seek to minimize the error of the fit to the transients trajectories and to the data on attractors, while penalizing the number of terms in the model. Our extension, demonstrated on several numerical examples, is more robust to noisy measurements and requires substantially less training data than the original SINDy method to correctly identify a parameterized dynamical system.">

        <tr id="Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

The deep learning framework incorporates the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable model. We automatically differentiate the CFD physics using a discrete adjoint code version. We present a fast communication method between TensorFlow (Python) and OpenFOAM (c++) that accelerates the training process. We applied the model to the flow past a square cylinder problem, reducing the error to about 50% for simulations outside the training distribution compared to the traditional solver in the x- and y-velocity components using an 8x coarser mesh. The training is affordable in terms of time and data samples since the architecture exploits the local features of the physics while generating stable predictions for mid-term simulations.">

In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data.

More precisely, we observe that the epistemic uncertainty collapses literally in the presence of large models and sometimes also of little training data, while we expect the exact opposite behaviour. This phenomenon, which we call"epistemic uncertainty hole", is all the more problematic as it undermines the entire applicative potential of BDL, which is based precisely on the use of epistemic uncertainty. As an example, we evaluate the practical consequences of this uncertainty hole on one of the main applications of BDL, namely the detection of out-of-distribution samples">

        <tr id="It is a challenging topic in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Standard approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs suffer under the curse of dimensionality (COD) in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation method grows at least exponentially in the PDE dimension and with such methods it is essentially impossible to approximately solve high-dimensional PDEs even when the fastest currently available computers are used. However, in the last years great progress has been made in this area of research through suitable deep learning (DL) based methods for PDEs in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate solutions of PDEs. Despite the remarkable success of such DL methods in simulations, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to prove (or disprove) that such methods can overcome the COD in the approximation of PDEs. However, there are nowadays several partial error analysis results for DL methods for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs in the literature which prove that DNNs can overcome the COD in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ and the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In the main result of this article we prove that for all $T,p\in(0,\infty)$ it holds that solutions $u_d\colon[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, of semilinear heat equations with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated in the $L^p$-sense on space-time regions without the COD by DNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU), the leaky ReLU, or the softplus activation function. In previous articles similar results have been established not for space-time regions but for the solutions $u_d(T,\cdot)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, at the terminal time $T$.">

        <tr id="State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.">

SPC integrates deep convolutional neural networks with physics-constrained methods based on the Euler equation to derive a new loss function that can accurately calculate the flow fields by considering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow fields at the previous moment. Compared to purely data-driven methods, SPC significantly reduces the dependency on training data volume by incorporating physical constraints. Additionally, the training process of SPC is more stable than that of data-driven methods. Taking the classic supersonic forward step flow as an example, SPC can accurately calculate strong discontinuities in the flow fields, while reducing the data volume by approximately 60%. In the generalization test experiment for forward step flow and compression ramp flow, SPC also demonstrates good predictive accuracy and generalization capability under different geometric configurations and inflow conditions.">

        <tr id="Graphs serve as generic tools to encode the underlying relational structure of data. Often this graph is not given, and so the task of inferring it from nodal observations becomes important. Traditional approaches formulate a convex inverse problem with a smoothness promoting objective and rely on iterative methods to obtain a solution. In supervised settings where graph labels are available, one can unroll and truncate these iterations into a deep network that is trained end-to-end. Such a network is parameter efficient and inherits inductive bias from the optimization formulation, an appealing aspect for data constrained settings in, e.g., medicine, finance, and the natural sciences. But typically such settings care equally about uncertainty over edge predictions, not just point estimates. Here we introduce novel iterations with independently interpretable parameters, i.e., parameters whose values - independent of other parameters' settings - proportionally influence characteristics of the estimated graph, such as edge sparsity. After unrolling these iterations, prior knowledge over such graph characteristics shape prior distributions over these independently interpretable network parameters to yield a Bayesian neural network (BNN) capable of graph structure learning (GSL) from smooth signal observations. Fast execution and parameter efficiency allow for high-fidelity posterior approximation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and thus uncertainty quantification on edge predictions. Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate this model's ability to provide well-calibrated estimates of uncertainty, in test cases that include unveiling economic sector modular structure from S$\&$P$500$ data and recovering pairwise digit similarities from MNIST images. Overall, this framework enables GSL in modest-scale applications where uncertainty on the data structure is paramount.">

This transformation incorporates crucial global state information with support for bi-directional recursive computation. For the transformed model, the joint state-memory-trend Bayesian filtering and smoothing frameworks are derived by introducing the bidirectional memory iteration mechanism and offline data into Bayesian estimation theory. The derived frameworks are implemented using the Gaussian approximation to ensure analytical properties and computational efficiency. Finally, the neural network modules within EBRNS and its two-stage training scheme are designed. Unlike most existing approaches that artificially combine deep learning and model-based estimation, the bidirectional recursion and internal gated structures of EBRNS are naturally derived from Bayesian estimation theory, explainably integrating prior model knowledge, online measurement, and offline data. Experiments on representative real-world datasets demonstrate that the high smoothing accuracy of EBRNS is accompanied by data efficiency and a lightweight parameter scale.">

        <tr id="Mathematical models are indispensable to the system biology toolkit for studying the structure and behavior of intracellular signaling networks. A common approach to modeling is to develop a system of equations that encode the known biology using approximations and simplifying assumptions. As a result, the same signaling pathway can be represented by multiple models, each with its set of underlying assumptions, which opens up challenges for model selection and decreases certainty in model predictions. Here, we use Bayesian multimodel inference to develop a framework to increase certainty in systems biology models. Using models of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we first show that multimodel inference increases predictive certainty and yields predictors that are robust to changes in the set of available models. We then show that predictions made with multi-model inference are robust to data uncertainties introduced by decreasing the measurement duration and reducing the sample size. Finally, we use multimodel inference to identify a new model to explain experimentally measured sub-cellular location-specific ERK activity dynamics. In summary, our framework highlights multimodel inference as a disciplined approach to increasing the certainty of intracellular signaling activity predictions.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible. While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii). The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.">

Existing models to learn the diffusion terms from observational data rely on complex bilevel optimization problems and properly model only the drift of the system. We propose a new simple model, JKOnet*, which bypasses altogether the complexity of existing architectures while presenting significantly enhanced representational capacity: JKOnet* recovers the potential, interaction, and internal energy components of the underlying diffusion process. JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss, runs at lightspeed, and drastically outperforms other baselines in practice. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals. Our methodology is based on the interpretation of diffusion processes as energy-minimizing trajectories in the probability space via the so-called JKO scheme, which we study via its first-order optimality conditions, in light of few-weeks-old advancements in optimization in the probability space.">

        <tr id="Stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are the foundation for pricing and hedging financial derivatives. The drift and volatility functions in SDE models are typically chosen to be algebraic functions with a small number (less than 5) parameters which can be calibrated to market data. A more flexible approach is to use neural networks to model the drift and volatility functions, which provides more degrees-of-freedom to match observed market data. Training of models requires optimizing over an SDE, which is computationally challenging. For European options, we develop a fast stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for training the neural network-SDE model. Our SGD algorithm uses two independent SDE paths to obtain an unbiased estimate of the direction of steepest descent. For American options, we optimize over the corresponding Kolmogorov partial differential equation (PDE). The neural network appears as coefficient functions in the PDE. Models are trained on large datasets (many contracts), requiring either large simulations (many Monte Carlo samples for the stock price paths) or large numbers of PDEs (a PDE must be solved for each contract). Numerical results are presented for real market data including S&P 500 index options, S&P 100 index options, and single-stock American options. The neural-network-based SDE models are compared against the Black-Scholes model, the Dupire's local volatility model, and the Heston model. Models are evaluated in terms of how accurate they are at pricing out-of-sample financial derivatives, which is a core task in derivative pricing at financial institutions.">

        <tr id="The Neural Network Field Theory correspondence (NNFT) is a mapping from neural network (NN) architectures into the space of statistical field theories (SFTs). The Bayesian renormalization group (BRG) is an information-theoretic coarse graining scheme that generalizes the principles of the Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) to arbitrarily parameterized probability distributions, including those of NNs. In BRG, coarse graining is performed in parameter space with respect to an information-theoretic distinguishability scale set by the Fisher information metric. In this paper, we unify NNFT and BRG to form a powerful new framework for exploring the space of NNs and SFTs, which we coin BRG-NNFT. With BRG-NNFT, NN training dynamics can be interpreted as inducing a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `IR' $\rightarrow$ `UV'. Conversely, applying an information-shell coarse graining to the trained network's parameters induces a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `UV' $\rightarrow$ `IR'. When the information-theoretic cutoff scale coincides with a standard momentum scale, BRG is equivalent to ERG. We demonstrate the BRG-NNFT correspondence on two analytically tractable examples. First, we construct BRG flows for trained, infinite-width NNs, of arbitrary depth, with generic activation functions. As a special case, we then restrict to architectures with a single infinitely-wide layer, scalar outputs, and generalized cos-net activations. In this case, we show that BRG coarse-graining corresponds exactly to the momentum-shell ERG flow of a free scalar SFT. Our analytic results are corroborated by a numerical experiment in which an ensemble of asymptotically wide NNs are trained and subsequently renormalized using an information-shell BRG scheme.">

As a result, these algorithms may search an unnecessarily large space and discover equations that are less accurate or overly complex.

Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming. In experiments across a diverse range of dynamical systems, our approach demonstrates better robustness against noise and recovers governing equations with significantly higher probability than baselines without symmetry.">

While sophisticated DNNs offer an impressive generalization, it is imperative to comprehend the quality, confidence, robustness, and uncertainty associated with their prediction. A thorough understanding of these quantities produces actionable insights that help application scientists make informed decisions. Unfortunately, the intrinsic design principles of the DNNs cannot beget prediction uncertainty, necessitating separate formulations for robust uncertainty-aware models for diverse visualization applications. To that end, this contribution demonstrates how the prediction uncertainty and sensitivity of DNNs can be estimated efficiently using various methods and then interactively compared and contrasted for deep image synthesis tasks. Our inspection suggests that uncertainty-aware deep visualization models generate illustrations of informative and superior quality and diversity. Furthermore, prediction uncertainty improves the robustness and interpretability of deep visualization models, making them practical and convenient for various scientific domains that thrive on visual analyses.">

The three desired properties of a general Equation of State model are adherence to the Laws of Thermodynamics, incorporation of phase transitions, and multiscale accuracy. Analytic models that adhere to all three are hard to develop and cumbersome to work with, often resulting in sacrificing one of these elements for the sake of efficiency. In this work, two deep-learning methods are proposed that provably satisfy the first and second conditions on a large-enough region of thermodynamic variable space. The first is based on learning the generating function (thermodynamic potential) while the second is based on structure-preserving, symplectic neural networks, respectively allowing modifications near or on phase transition regions. They can be used either"from scratch"to learn a full Equation of State, or in conjunction with a pre-existing consistent model, functioning as a modification that better adheres to experimental data. We formulate the theory and provide several computational examples to justify both approaches, and highlight their advantages and shortcomings.">

However, in this perspective, we argue that a more successful approach is a proper combination of these two methodologies. We discuss how ideas coming from physical modeling neuronal processing led to early formulations of computational neural networks, e.g., Hopfield networks. We then show how modern learning approaches like Potts models, Boltzmann machines, and the transformer architecture are related to each other, specifically, through a shared energy representation. We summarize recent efforts to establish these connections and provide examples on how each of these formulations integrating physical modeling and machine learning have been successful in tackling recent problems in biomolecular structure, dynamics, function, evolution, and design. Instances include protein structure prediction; improvement in computational complexity and accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations; better inference of the effects of mutations in proteins leading to improved evolutionary modeling and finally how machine learning is revolutionizing protein engineering and design. Going beyond naturally existing protein sequences, a connection to protein design is discussed where synthetic sequences are able to fold to naturally occurring motifs driven by a model rooted in physical principles. We show that this model is "learnable" and propose its future use in the generation of unique sequences that can fold into a target structure.">

Despite these advances, our understanding of how pretraining affects neural operators is still limited; studies generally propose tailored architectures and datasets that make it challenging to compare or examine different pretraining frameworks. To address this, we compare various pretraining methods without optimizing architecture choices to characterize pretraining dynamics on different models and datasets as well as to understand its scaling and generalization behavior. We find that pretraining is highly dependent on model and dataset choices, but in general transfer learning or physics-based pretraining strategies work best. In addition, pretraining performance can be further improved by using data augmentations. Lastly, pretraining is additionally beneficial when fine-tuning in scarce data regimes or when generalizing to downstream data similar to the pretraining distribution. Through providing insights into pretraining neural operators for physics prediction, we hope to motivate future work in developing and evaluating pretraining methods for PDEs.">

Achieving optimal performance with these models can be challenging due to the extreme sparsity of inputs and distribution shifts induced by data corruptions. To this end, large, noise-free synthetic datasets can serve as shape priors to help models fill in gaps, but the resulting reconstructions must be approached with caution. Uncertainty estimation is crucial for assessing the quality of these reconstructions, particularly in identifying areas where the model is uncertain about the parts it has inferred from the prior. In this paper, we introduce Dropsembles, a novel method for uncertainty estimation in tuned implicit functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments, starting with toy examples and progressing to a real-world scenario. Specifically, we train a Convolutional Occupancy Network on synthetic anatomical data and test it on low-resolution MRI segmentations of the lumbar spine. Our results show that Dropsembles achieve the accuracy and calibration levels of deep ensembles but with significantly less computational cost.">

        <tr id="In the trend of hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, Physic Informed Machine Learning has seen a growing interest. It operates mainly by imposing a data, learning or inductive bias with simulation data, Partial Differential Equations or equivariance and invariance properties.

To address this challenge, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach together with Graph Neural Network. We thus propose Neural Bond Graph Encoder (NBgE), a model agnostic physical-informed encoder tailored for multi-physics systems. It provides an unified framework for any multi-physics informed AI with a graph encoder readable for any deep learning model. Our experiments on two challenging multi-domain physical systems - a Direct Current Motor and the Respiratory system - demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a multi-variate time series forecasting task.">

        <tr id="Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.">

        <tr id="Operator learning problems arise in many key areas of scientific computing where Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are used to model physical systems. In such scenarios, the operators map between Banach or Hilbert spaces. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning operators between Banach spaces, in contrast to the vast majority of past works considering only Hilbert spaces. We focus on learning holomorphic operators - an important class of problems with many applications. We combine arbitrary approximate encoders and decoders with standard feedforward Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures - specifically, those with constant width exceeding the depth - under standard $\ell^2$-loss minimization. We first identify a family of DNNs such that the resulting Deep Learning (DL) procedure achieves optimal generalization bounds for such operators. For standard fully-connected architectures, we then show that there are uncountably many minimizers of the training problem that yield equivalent optimal performance. The DNN architectures we consider are `problem agnostic', with width and depth only depending on the amount of training data $m$ and not on regularity assumptions of the target operator. Next, we show that DL is optimal for this problem: no recovery procedure can surpass these generalization bounds up to log terms. Finally, we present numerical results demonstrating the practical performance on challenging problems including the parametric diffusion, Navier-Stokes-Brinkman and Boussinesq PDEs.">

While the results were obtained, the number of hidden layers and the number of neural networks in the layers also varied. These results are shown in tables.

However, these approaches often demand extensive data across a wide range of inputs and may encounter overfitting issues. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new data-driven modeling approach for DC-DC converters based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). This approach incorporates prior knowledge about numerical ODE solvers into the NN structures, leading to a substantial improvement in generalization performance. In this method, the kernel function of numerical integration is replaced by a fully-connected NN, and the system ODE is solved through common numerical solvers iteratively in time. The results of our study demonstrate a significant enhancement in generalization performance across various input frequencies using variable step solvers while maintaining excellent precision.">

More specifically, by replacing the standard KL divergence with the R\'enyi divergence between the posterior and the approximated prior, we ameliorate the impact of the misspecified prior via a parameter {\alpha} so that the resulting posterior focuses more on tail samples and reduce density on overconfident regions. Our experiments showed log-likelihood improvements on several existing NP families.

Many studies tried to combine the measurement into diffusion by score function replacement, matrix decomposition, or optimization algorithms, but it is hard to balance the data consistency and realness. The slow sampling speed is also a main obstacle to its wide application. To address the challenges, we propose Deep Data Consistency (DDC) to update the data consistency step with a deep learning model when solving inverse problems with diffusion models. By analyzing existing methods, the variational bound training objective is used to maximize the conditional posterior and reduce its impact on the diffusion process. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods in linear and non-linear tasks, DDC demonstrates its outstanding performance of both similarity and realness metrics in generating high-quality solutions with only 5 inference steps in 0.77 seconds on average. In addition, the robustness of DDC is well illustrated in the experiments across datasets, with large noise and the capacity to solve multiple tasks in only one pre-trained model.">

However, different types of ML models may have contrasting advantages and disadvantages, which become critical during the optimal selection of a specific data‐driven model for a particular application as well as estimation of parameters during model training. This paper compares and contrasts two different types of data‐driven modelling approaches, namely the series/parallel all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural network models and models from a Bayesian ML approach. Both types of AI modelling approaches considered in this work have shown to significantly outperform several state‐of‐the‐art steady‐state and dynamic data‐driven modelling techniques for various performance measures, specifically, model sparsity, predictive capabilities, and computational expense. The performances of the proposed model structures and algorithms have been evaluated for two nonlinear dynamic chemical engineering systems—a plug‐flow reactor for vapour phase cracking of acetone for production of acetic anhydride and a pilot‐plant for post‐combustion CO2 capture using monoethanolamine as the solvent. For the validation data from the CO2 capture pilot plant, root mean squared error (RMSE) for flue gas outlet temperature, flowrate and CO2 concentration is 0.05%, 1.07%, and 5.0%, respectively, for the all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural networks and 0.1%, 1.75%, and 14.14%, respectively, for the Bayesian ML models. For the plug flow reactor data, the Bayesian ML models yield superior RMSE compared to the all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural networks when the measurement data are corrupted with Gaussian, auto‐correlated, or cross‐correlated noise.">

We introduce the perturbation idea into the designed decision-focused loss function to ensure the differentiability over linear storage models, supported by a theoretical analysis of the perturbed loss function.

Recently, a non-asymptotic error bound has been developed to measure the performance of the fully connected DNN estimator with ReLU activation functions for estimating regression models. The paper at hand gives a small improvement on the current error bound based on the latest results on the approximation ability of DNN. More importantly, however, a non-random subsampling technique--scalable subsampling--is applied to construct a `subagged' DNN estimator. Under regularity conditions, it is shown that the subagged DNN estimator is computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy for either estimation or prediction tasks. Beyond point estimation/prediction, we propose different approaches to build confidence and prediction intervals based on the subagged DNN estimator. In addition to being asymptotically valid, the proposed confidence/prediction intervals appear to work well in finite samples. All in all, the scalable subsampling DNN estimator offers the complete package in terms of statistical inference, i.e., (a) computational efficiency; (b) point estimation/prediction accuracy; and (c) allowing for the construction of practically useful confidence and prediction intervals.">

In this paper, we draw a clear connection between the two and their key assumptions, allowing us to apply identifiable methods developed in causal representation learning to dynamical systems. At the same time, we can leverage scalable differentiable solvers developed for differential equations to build models that are both identifiable and practical. Overall, we learn explicitly controllable models that isolate the trajectory-specific parameters for further downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution classification or treatment effect estimation.

        <tr id="When neural networks are trained from data to simulate the dynamics of physical systems, they encounter a persistent challenge: the long-time dynamics they produce are often unphysical or unstable. We analyze the origin of such instabilities when learning linear dynamical systems, focusing on the training dynamics. We make several analytical findings which empirical observations suggest extend to nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.">

In this work, we consider a modified Symbolic Artificial Neural Network-Trained Expressions (SymANNTEx) architecture for this task, an architecture more expressive than others in the literature. We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented. We show that our modified SymANNTEx model properly identifies single-state maps and achieves moderate success in approximating a dual-state attractor.

        <tr id="We show at a physics level of rigor that Bayesian inference with a fully connected neural network and a shaped nonlinearity of the form $\phi(t) = t + \psi t^3/L$ is (perturbatively) solvable in the regime where the number of training datapoints $P$ , the input dimension $N_0$, the network layer widths $N$, and the network depth $L$ are simultaneously large. Our results hold with weak assumptions on the data; the main constraint is that $P<N_0$. We provide techniques to compute the model evidence and posterior to arbitrary order in $1/N$ and at arbitrary temperature. We report the following results from the first-order computation: 1. When the width $N$ is much larger than the depth $L$ and training set size $P$, neural network Bayesian inference coincides with Bayesian inference using a kernel. The value of $\psi$ determines the curvature of a sphere, hyperbola, or plane into which the training data is implicitly embedded under the feature map. 2. When $LP/N$ is a small constant, neural network Bayesian inference departs from the kernel regime. At zero temperature, neural network Bayesian inference is equivalent to Bayesian inference using a data-dependent kernel, and $LP/N$ serves as an effective depth that controls the extent of feature learning. 3. In the restricted case of deep linear networks ($\psi=0$) and noisy data, we show a simple data model for which evidence and generalization error are optimal at zero temperature. As $LP/N$ increases, both evidence and generalization further improve, demonstrating the benefit of depth in benign overfitting.">

        <tr id="Cardiomyopathies, often caused by mutations in genes encoding muscle proteins, are traditionally treated by phenotyping hearts and addressing symptoms post irreversible damage. With advancements in genotyping, early diagnosis is now possible, potentially preventing such damage. However, the intricate structure of muscle and its myriad proteins make treatment predictions challenging. Here we approach the problem of estimating therapeutic targets for a mutation in mouse muscle using a spatially explicit half sarcomere muscle model. We selected 9 rate parameters in our model linked to both small molecules and cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. We then randomly varied these rate parameters and simulated an isometric twitch for each combination to generate a large training dataset. We used this dataset to train a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), a technique used in Bayesian parameter estimation. Given simulated or experimental isometric twitches, this machine learning model is able to then predict the set of rate parameters which are most likely to yield that result. We then predict the set of rate parameters associated with both control and the cardiac Troponin C (cTnC) I61Q variant in mouse trabeculae and model parameters that recover the abnormal I61Q cTnC twitches. SIGNIFICANCE Machine learning techniques have potential to accelerate discoveries in biologically complex systems. However, they require large data sets and can be challenging in high dimensional systems such as cardiac muscle. In this study, we combined experimental measures of cardiac muscle twitch forces with mechanistic simulations and a newly developed mixture of Bayesian inference with neural networks (in autoencoders) to solve the inverse problem of determining the underlying kinetics for observed force generation by cardiac muscle. The autoencoders are trained on millions of simulations spanning parameter spaces that correspond to the mechanochemistry of cardiac sarcomeres. We apply the trained model to experimental data in order to infer parameters that can explain a diseased twitch and ways to recover it.">

To get there, we derive previously unknown adjoint systems for Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, implement them in JAX, and show that the resulting code can compete with Diffrax when it comes to differentiating PDEs, GPyTorch for selecting Gaussian process models and beats standard factorisation methods for calibrating Bayesian neural networks.

        <tr id="In the context of structural health monitoring (SHM), the selection and extraction of damage-sensitive features from raw sensor recordings represent a critical step towards solving the inverse problem underlying the structural health identification. This work introduces a new way to enhance stochastic approaches to SHM through the use of deep neural networks. A learnable feature extractor and a feature-oriented surrogate model are synergistically exploited to evaluate a likelihood function within a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. The feature extractor undergoes a supervised pairwise training to map sensor recordings onto a low-dimensional metric space, which encapsulates the sensitivity to structural health parameters. The surrogate model maps the structural health parameters onto their feature description. The procedure enables the updating of beliefs about structural health parameters, effectively replacing the need for a computationally expensive numerical (finite element) model. A preliminary offline phase involves the generation of a labeled dataset to train both the feature extractor and the surrogate model. Within a simulation-based SHM framework, training vibration responses are cost-effectively generated by means of a multi-fidelity surrogate modeling strategy to approximate sensor recordings under varying damage and operational conditions. The multi-fidelity surrogate exploits model order reduction and artificial neural networks to speed up the data generation phase while ensuring the damage-sensitivity of the approximated signals. The proposed strategy is assessed through three synthetic case studies, demonstrating remarkable results in terms of accuracy of the estimated quantities and computational efficiency.">

Our key insight is to use latent features drawn from a learnable prior distribution conditioned on the underlying particle states to capture the invisible and complex physical properties. To achieve this, we train a parametrized prior learner given visual observations to approximate the visual posterior of inverse graphics, and both the particle states and the visual posterior are obtained from a learned neural renderer. The converged prior learner is embedded in our probabilistic physics engine, allowing us to perform novel simulations on unseen geometries, boundaries, and dynamics without knowledge of the true physical parameters.

The underlying simplifications in eddy viscosity models make them computationally inexpensive but also introduce structural uncertainties in their predictions. Currently the Eigenspace Perturbation Method is the only approach to predict these uncertainties. Due to its purely physics based nature this method often leads to unrealistically large uncertainty bounds that lead to exceedingly conservative designs. We use a Deep Learning based approach to address this issue. We control the perturbations using trained deep learning models that predict how much to perturb the modeled Reynolds stresses. This is executed using a Convolutional Neural Network that learns the difference between eddy viscosity based model predictions and high fidelity data as a mapping of flow features.

By comparing the performance of these models on our dataset, we identified the best performing ones and fine-tuned them to optimize their performance for our task. In addition, to further improve the performance of the model, we introduced a spatial channel attention mechanism. We found that deploying the spatial channel attention mechanism at appropriate locations could significantly improve the performance of the model. However, deploying the spatial channel attention mechanism at all locations might cause the model to focus too much on local features and ignore global features. Overall, our results show that the performance of autonomous driving systems can be effectively improved by improving the network structure and training methods.">

It indicates the abundance and intensity of physical inputs affect the performance of the Bayesian optimization approach as well as the robustness of the BNN.

In this note, we provide a concise summary of the basics of the theory, aiming to be intuitive to the interdisciplinary neuroscience community. We contextualize our methods, illustrating how to readily connect the parameters of our formulation to experimental variables using well-known renormalization procedures.

        <tr id="Before we attempt to learn a function between two (sets of) observables of a physical process, we must first decide what the inputs and what the outputs of the desired function are going to be. Here we demonstrate two distinct, data-driven ways of initially deciding ``the right quantities'' to relate through such a function, and then proceed to learn it. This is accomplished by processing multiple simultaneous heterogeneous data streams (ensembles of time series) from observations of a physical system: multiple observation processes of the system. We thus determine (a) what subsets of observables are common between the observation processes (and therefore observable from each other, relatable through a function); and (b) what information is unrelated to these common observables, and therefore particular to each observation process, and not contributing to the desired function. Any data-driven function approximation technique can subsequently be used to learn the input-output relation, from k-nearest neighbors and Geometric Harmonics to Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks. Two particular ``twists'' of the approach are discussed. The first has to do with the identifiability of particular quantities of interest from the measurements. We now construct mappings from a single set of observations of one process to entire level sets of measurements of the process, consistent with this single set. The second attempts to relate our framework to a form of causality: if one of the observation processes measures ``now'', while the second observation process measures ``in the future'', the function to be learned among what is common across observation processes constitutes a dynamical model for the system evolution.">

The DEQH model inherently captures the self-consistency nature of Hamiltonian, a critical aspect often overlooked by traditional machine learning approaches for Hamiltonian prediction. By employing DEQ within our model architecture, we circumvent the need for DFT calculations during the training phase to introduce the Hamiltonian's self-consistency, thus addressing computational bottlenecks associated with large or complex systems. We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian. Ablation studies of DEQHNet further elucidate the network's effectiveness, offering insights into the potential of DEQ-integrated networks for Hamiltonian learning.">

A novel convergence analysis is conducted, inspired by the fixed-point methods established for traditional regularization-by-denoising algorithms and compatible with weighted annealing.

The core idea of ElastoGen is converting the global differential operator, corresponding to the nonlinear elastodynamic equations, into iterative local convolution-like operations, which naturally fit modern neural networks. Each network module is specifically designed to support this goal rather than functioning as a black box.

        <tr id="Diffusion models excel at creating visually-convincing images, but they often struggle to meet subtle constraints inherent in the training data. Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model not only improves its distribution-matching accuracy but also makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are inflexible with different types of constraints. Recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs) in an unconstrained space defined by a mirror map and to impose the constraint with an inverse mirror map, but analytical mirror maps are challenging to derive for complex constraints. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that pushes data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.">

In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised learning method based on Siamese Neural Networks (SNN), trying to explore the potential of neural network (NN) in the study of critical behaviors beyond the approaches of supervised and unsupervised learning. By focusing on the (1+1) dimensional bond directed percolation (DP) model of nonequilibrium phase transition, we use the SNN to predict the critical values and critical exponents of the system. Different from traditional ML methods, the input of SNN is a set of configuration data pairs and the output prediction is similarity, which prompts to find an anchor point of data for pair comparison during the test. In our study, during test we set different bond probability $p$ as anchors, and discuss the impact of the configurations at this anchors on predictions. More, we use an iterative method to find the optimal training interval to make the algorithm more efficient, and the prediction results are comparable to other ML methods.">

        <tr id="Bayesian neural networks address epistemic uncertainty by learning a posterior distribution over model parameters. Sampling and weighting networks according to this posterior yields an ensemble model referred to as Bayes ensemble. Ensembles of neural networks (deep ensembles) can profit from the cancellation of errors effect: Errors by ensemble members may average out and the deep ensemble achieves better predictive performance than each individual network. We argue that neither the sampling nor the weighting in a Bayes ensemble are particularly well-suited for increasing generalization performance, as they do not support the cancellation of errors effect, which is evident in the limit from the Bernstein-von~Mises theorem for misspecified models. In contrast, a weighted average of models where the weights are optimized by minimizing a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound can improve generalization performance. This requires that the optimization takes correlations between models into account, which can be achieved by minimizing the tandem loss at the cost that hold-out data for estimating error correlations need to be available. The PAC-Bayesian weighting increases the robustness against correlated models and models with lower performance in an ensemble. This allows us to safely add several models from the same learning process to an ensemble, instead of using early-stopping for selecting a single weight configuration. Our study presents empirical results supporting these conceptual considerations on four different classification datasets. We show that state-of-the-art Bayes ensembles from the literature, despite being computationally demanding, do not improve over simple uniformly weighted deep ensembles and cannot match the performance of deep ensembles weighted by optimizing the tandem loss, which additionally come with non-vacuous generalization guarantees.">

The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks.

        <tr id="We introduce a machine learning (ML) supervised model function that is inspired by the variational principle of physics. This ML hypothesis evolutionary method, termed ML-Omega, allows us to go from data to differential equation(s) underlying the physical (chemical, engineering, etc.) phenomena the data are derived from. The fundamental equations of physics can be derived from this ML-Omega evolutionary method when provided the proper training data. By training the ML-Omega model function with only three hydrogen-like atom energies, the method can find Schr\"odinger's exact functional and, from it, Schr\"odinger's fundamental equation. Then, in the field of density functional theory (DFT), when the model function is trained with the energies from the known Thomas-Fermi (TF) formula E = -0.7687Z^7/3, it correctly finds the exact TF functional. Finally, the method is applied to find a local orbital-free (OF) functional expression of the independent electron kinetic energy functional Ts based on the gamma-TF-lambda-vW model. By considering the theoretical energies of only 5 atoms (He, Be, Ne, Mg, Ar) as the training set, the evolutionary ML-Omega method finds an ML-Omega-OF-DFT local Ts functional (gamma-TF-lambda-vW (0.964, 1/4)) that outperforms all the OF- DFT functionals of a representative group. Moreover, our ML-Omega-OF functional overcomes the LDA's and some local GGA-DFT's functionals' difficulty to describe the stretched bond region at the correct spin configuration of diatomic molecules. Although our evolutionary ML-Omega model function can work without an explicit prior-form functional, by using the techniques of symbolic regression, in this work we exploit prior-form functional expressions to make the training process faster in the example problems presented here.">

        <tr id="Linearity of Koopman operators and simplicity of their estimators coupled with model-reduction capabilities has lead to their great popularity in applications for learning dynamical systems. While nonparametric Koopman operator learning in infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is well understood for autonomous systems, its control system analogues are largely unexplored. Addressing systems with control inputs in a principled manner is crucial for fully data-driven learning of controllers, especially since existing approaches commonly resort to representational heuristics or parametric models of limited expressiveness and scalability. We address the aforementioned challenge by proposing a universal framework via control-affine reproducing kernels that enables direct estimation of a single operator even for control systems. The proposed approach, called control-Koopman operator regression (cKOR), is thus completely analogous to Koopman operator regression of the autonomous case. First in the literature, we present a nonparametric framework for learning Koopman operator representations of nonlinear control-affine systems that does not suffer from the curse of control input dimensionality. This allows for reformulating the infinite-dimensional learning problem in a finite-dimensional space based solely on data without apriori loss of precision due to a restriction to a finite span of functions or inputs as in other approaches. For enabling applications to large-scale control systems, we also enhance the scalability of control-Koopman operator estimators by leveraging random projections (sketching). The efficacy of our novel cKOR approach is demonstrated on both forecasting and control tasks.">

We show that the error of the DPM can be bounded by the loss function and $O(\frac{1}{\lambda})+O(\lambda h) +O(\sqrt{h})$, where $h$ is the step size in time and $\lambda$ is the penalty parameter. This finding emphasizes the need for careful consideration when selecting the penalization parameter and suggests that the discretization error converges at a rate of order $\frac{1}{2}$.

Our results show that the PDE operators in the inverse problem can stabilize the variance and even behave benign overfitting for fixed-dimensional problems, exhibiting different behaviors from regression problems. Besides, our investigation also demonstrates the impact of various inductive biases introduced by minimizing different Sobolev norms as a form of implicit regularization. For the regularized least squares estimator, we find that all considered inductive biases can achieve the optimal convergence rate, provided the regularization parameter is appropriately chosen.

Purpose
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become a new tendency in flow simulation, because of their self-advantage of integrating both physical and monitored information of fields in solving the Navier–Stokes equation and its variants. In view of the strengths of PINN, this study aims to investigate the impact of spatially embedded data distribution on the flow field results around the train in the crosswind environment reconstructed by PINN.


Design/methodology/approach
PINN can integrate data residuals with physical residuals into the loss function to train its parameters, allowing it to approximate the solution of the governing equations. In addition, with the aid of labelled training data, PINN can also incorporate the real site information of the flow field in model training. In light of this, the PINN model is adopted to reconstruct a two-dimensional time-averaged flow field around a train under crosswinds in the spatial domain with the aid of sparse flow field data, and the prediction results are compared with the reference results obtained from numerical modelling.


Findings
The prediction results from PINN results demonstrated a low discrepancy with those obtained from numerical simulations. The results of this study indicate that a threshold of the spatial embedded data density exists, in both the near wall and far wall areas on the train’s leeward side, as well as the near train surface area. In other words, a negative effect on the PINN reconstruction accuracy will emerge if the spatial embedded data density exceeds or slips below the threshold. Also, the optimum arrangement of the spatial embedded data in reconstructing the flow field of the train in crosswinds is obtained in this work.


Originality/value
In this work, a strategy of reconstructing the time-averaged flow field of the train under crosswind conditions is proposed based on the physics-informed data-driven method, which enhances the scope of neural network applications. In addition, for the flow field reconstruction, the effect of spatial embedded data arrangement in PINN is compared to improve its accuracy.

        <tr id="Symmetry is one of the most central concepts in physics, and it is no surprise that it has also been widely adopted as an inductive bias for machine-learning models applied to the physical sciences. This is especially true for models targeting the properties of matter at the atomic scale. Both established and state-of-the-art approaches, with almost no exceptions, are built to be exactly equivariant to translations, permutations, and rotations of the atoms. Incorporating symmetries -- rotations in particular -- constrains the model design space and implies more complicated architectures that are often also computationally demanding. There are indications that non-symmetric models can easily learn symmetries from data, and that doing so can even be beneficial for the accuracy of the model. We put a model that obeys rotational invariance only approximately to the test, in realistic scenarios involving simulations of gas-phase, liquid, and solid water. We focus specifically on physical observables that are likely to be affected -- directly or indirectly -- by symmetry breaking, finding negligible consequences when the model is used in an interpolative, bulk, regime. Even for extrapolative gas-phase predictions, the model remains very stable, even though symmetry artifacts are noticeable. We also discuss strategies that can be used to systematically reduce the magnitude of symmetry breaking when it occurs, and assess their impact on the convergence of observables.">

        <tr id="Intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity is nowadays understood to play a critical role in disease progression and treatment failure. Accordingly, there has been increasing interest in the development of mathematical models capable of capturing its role in cancer cell adaptation. This can be systematically achieved by means of models comprising phenotype-structured nonlocal partial differential equations, tracking the evolution of the phenotypic density distribution of the cell population, which may be compared to gene and protein expression distributions obtained experimentally. Nevertheless, given the high analytical and computational cost of solving these models, much is to be gained from reducing them to systems of ordinary differential equations for the moments of the distribution. We propose a generalised method of model-reduction, relying on the use of a moment generating function, Taylor series expansion and truncation closure, to reduce a nonlocal reaction-advection-diffusion equation, with general phenotypic drift and proliferation rate functions, to a system of moment equations up to arbitrary order. Our method extends previous results in the literature, which we address via two examples, by removing any \textit{a priori} assumption on the shape of the distribution, and provides a flexible framework for mathematical modellers to account for the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer adaptive dynamics, in a simpler mathematical framework.">

The core enabler is a physics-based modeling framework that generates a multitude of synthetic data to align the LLM to a physically consistent initial state before finetuning. Our framework features a two-phase training strategy: (1) utilizing the large-in-amount while less accurate synthetic data for supervised pretraining, and (2) finetuning the phase-1 model with limited experimental data. We empirically demonstrate that supervised pretraining is vital to obtaining accurate finetuned LLMs, via the lens of learning polymer flammability metrics where cone calorimeter data is sparse.">

        <tr id="Multi-dimensional parameter spaces are commonly encountered in astroparticle physics theories that attempt to capture novel phenomena. However, they often possess complicated posterior geometries that are expensive to traverse using techniques traditional to this community. Effectively sampling these spaces is crucial to bridge the gap between experiment and theory. Several recent innovations, which are only beginning to make their way into this field, have made navigating such complex posteriors possible. These include GPU acceleration, automatic differentiation, and neural-network-guided reparameterization. We apply these advancements to astroparticle physics experimental results in the context of novel neutrino physics and benchmark their performances against traditional nested sampling techniques. Compared to nested sampling alone, we find that these techniques increase performance for both nested sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, accelerating inference by factors of $\sim 100$ and $\sim 60$, respectively. As nested sampling also evaluates the Bayesian evidence, these advancements can be exploited to improve model comparison performance while retaining compatibility with existing implementations that are widely used in the natural sciences.">

This framework is then used to build a novel finite neuron method to solve the 2nd order elliptic equations with the Dirichlet boundary condition. Our algorithm is the first algorithm, proven to lead to shallow neural network solutions with an optimal H1 norm error. We show that a widely used penalized PDE, which imposes the Dirichlet boundary condition weakly can be interpreted as the first element of the sequence of PDEs within our framework. Furthermore, numerically, we show that it may not lead to the solution with the optimal H1 norm error bound in general. On the other hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the second and later elements of a sequence of PDEs can lead to an adequate solution with the optimal H1 norm error bound.

However, they have several drawbacks, including training instability and inability to cover the entire data distribution, especially for regions where data are rare. This is particularly challenging for whole-event, full-detector simulations in high-energy heavy-ion experiments, such as sPHENIX at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider experiments, where thousands of particles are produced per event and interact with the detector. This work investigates the effectiveness of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) as an AI-based generative surrogate model for the sPHENIX experiment that includes the heavy-ion event generation and response of the entire calorimeter stack. DDPM performance in sPHENIX simulation data is compared with a popular rival, GANs. Results show that both DDPMs and GANs can reproduce the data distribution where the examples are abundant (low-to-medium calorimeter energies). Nonetheless, DDPMs significantly outperform GANs, especially in high-energy regions where data are rare. Additionally, DDPMs exhibit superior stability compared to GANs. The results are consistent between both central and peripheral centrality heavy-ion collision events. Moreover, DDPMs offer a substantial speedup of approximately a factor of 100 compared to the traditional Geant4 simulation method.">

Most research on uncertainty focuses on output uncertainty (predictions), but minimal attention is paid to uncertainty at inputs. We propose a method for propagating uncertainty in the inputs through a Neural Network that is simultaneously able to estimate input, data, and model uncertainty. Our results show that this propagation of input uncertainty results in a more stable decision boundary even under large amounts of input noise than comparatively simple Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, we discuss and demonstrate that input uncertainty, when propagated through the model, results in model uncertainty at the outputs. The explicit incorporation of input uncertainty may be beneficial in situations where the amount of input uncertainty is known, though good datasets for this are still needed.">

        <tr id="This paper expands the damped block Newton (dBN) method introduced recently in [4] for 1D diffusion-reaction equations and least-squares data fitting problems. To determine the linear parameters (the weights and bias of the output layer) of the neural network (NN), the dBN method requires solving systems of linear equations involving the mass matrix. While the mass matrix for local hat basis functions is tri-diagonal and well-conditioned, the mass matrix for NNs is dense and ill-conditioned. For example, the condition number of the NN mass matrix for quasi-uniform meshes is at least ${\cal O}(n^4)$. We present a factorization of the mass matrix that enables solving the systems of linear equations in ${\cal O}(n)$ operations. To determine the non-linear parameters (the weights and bias of the hidden layer), one step of a damped Newton method is employed at each iteration. A Gauss-Newton method is used in place of Newton for the instances in which the Hessian matrices are singular. This modified dBN is referred to as dBGN. For both methods, the computational cost per iteration is ${\cal O}(n)$. Numerical results demonstrate the ability dBN and dBGN to efficiently achieve accurate results and outperform BFGS for select examples.">

        <tr id="Living organisms exhibit remarkable adaptations across all scales, from molecules to ecosystems. We believe that many of these adaptations correspond to optimal solutions driven by evolution, training, and underlying physical and chemical laws and constraints. While some argue against such optimality principles due to their potential ambiguity, we propose generalized inverse optimal control to infer them directly from data. This novel approach incorporates multi-criteria optimality, nestedness of objective functions on different scales, the presence of active constraints, the possibility of switches of optimality principles during the observed time horizon, maximization of robustness, and minimization of time as important special cases, as well as uncertainties involved with the mathematical modeling of biological systems. This data-driven approach ensures that optimality principles are not merely theoretical constructs but are firmly rooted in experimental observations. Furthermore, the inferred principles can be used in forward optimal control to predict and manipulate biological systems, with possible applications in bio-medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. As discussed and illustrated, the well-posed problem formulation and the inference are challenging and require a substantial interdisciplinary effort in the development of theory and robust numerical methods.">

Unfortunately, the problem is generally ill-posed due to the possible presence of unknown delays in the measurements. In this paper, we offer a solution of this problem by using a variational Bayes framework, where the uncertainty over the delays is marginalized in order to obtain conservative coupling estimates. To overcome the well-known overconfidence of classical variational methods, we use a hybrid-VI scheme where the (possibly flat or multimodal) posterior over the measurement parameters is estimated using a forward KL loss while the (nearly convex) conditional posterior over the couplings is estimated using the highly scalable gradient-based VI. In our ground-truth experiments, we show that the network provides reliable and conservative estimates of the couplings, greatly outperforming similar methods such as regression DCM.">

This work shows that synaptic pruning facilitates efficient statistical structure learning. We extend previously established canonical neural networks to derive a synaptic pruning scheme that is formally equivalent to an online Bayesian model selection. The proposed scheme, termed Bayesian synaptic model pruning (BSyMP), utilizes connectivity parameters to switch between the presence (ON) and absence (OFF) of synaptic connections. Mathematical analyses reveal that these parameters converge to zero for uninformative connections, thus providing reliable and efficient model reduction. This enables the identification of a plausible structure for the environmental model, particularly when the environment is characterized by sparse likelihood and transition matrices. Through causal inference and rule learning simulations, we demonstrate that BSyMP achieves model reduction more efficiently than the conventional Bayesian model reduction scheme. These findings indicate that synaptic pruning could be a neuronal substrate underlying structure learning and generalizability in the brain.">

Under different environmental perturbations, each biological system exhibits a unique, structured phenotypic response. This structure can be learned based on limited data and once learned, can constrain subsequent quantitative predictions. We demonstrate that SAR requires significantly fewer data comparing to other existing machine-learning methods to achieve a high prediction accuracy, first on simulated data, then on experimental data of various systems and input dimensions. We then show how a learned structure can guide effective design of new experiments.

Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with an exponent of approximately -0.5, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.">

In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.">

We propose an extension of manifold-constrained Gaussian processes to conduct parameter inference for DDEs, whereas the time delay parameters have posed a challenge for existing methods that bypass numerical solvers. Our method uses a Bayesian framework to impose a Gaussian process model over the system trajectory, conditioned on the manifold constraint that satisfies the DDEs. For efficient computation, a linear interpolation scheme is developed to approximate the values of the time-delayed system outputs, along with corresponding theoretical error bounds on the approximated derivatives.

        <tr id="Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics. Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.">

        <tr id="Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) are powerful generative models showing competitive performance in various domains, including image synthesis and 3D point cloud generation. However, sampling from pre-trained DPMs involves multiple neural function evaluations (NFE) to transform Gaussian noise samples into images, resulting in higher computational costs compared to single-step generative models such as GANs or VAEs. Therefore, a crucial problem is to reduce NFE while preserving generation quality. To this end, we propose LD3, a lightweight framework for learning time discretization while sampling from the diffusion ODE encapsulated by DPMs. LD3 can be combined with various diffusion ODE solvers and consistently improves performance without retraining resource-intensive neural networks. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that LD3 enhances sampling efficiency compared to distillation-based methods, without the extensive computational overhead. We evaluate our method with extensive experiments on 5 datasets, covering unconditional and conditional sampling in both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs. For example, in about 5 minutes of training on a single GPU, our method reduces the FID score from 6.63 to 2.68 on CIFAR10 (7 NFE), and in around 20 minutes, decreases the FID from 8.51 to 5.03 on class-conditional ImageNet-256 (5 NFE). LD3 complements distillation methods, offering a more efficient approach to sampling from pre-trained diffusion models.">

        <tr id="Spectral methods provide highly accurate numerical solutions for partial differential equations, exhibiting exponential convergence with the number of spectral nodes. Traditionally, in addressing time-dependent nonlinear problems, attention has been on low-order finite difference schemes for time discretization and spectral element schemes for spatial variables. However, our recent developments have resulted in the application of spectral methods to both space and time variables, preserving spectral convergence in both domains. Leveraging Tensor Train techniques, our approach tackles the curse of dimensionality inherent in space-time methods. Here, we extend this methodology to the nonlinear time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our discretization scheme exhibits a low-rank structure, facilitating translation to tensor-train (TT) format. Nevertheless, controlling the TT-rank across Newton's iterations, needed to deal with the nonlinearity, poses a challenge, leading us to devise the"Step Truncation TT-Newton"method. We demonstrate the exponential convergence of our methods through various benchmark examples. Importantly, our scheme offers significantly reduced memory requirement compared to the full-grid scheme.">

        <tr id="This study introduces a novel approach to ensure the existence and uniqueness of optimal parameters in neural networks. The paper details how a recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be transformed into a contraction in a domain where its parameters are linear. It then demonstrates that a prediction problem modeled through an RNN, with a specific regularization term in the loss function, can have its first-order conditions expressed analytically. This system of equations is reduced to two matrix equations involving Sylvester equations, which can be partially solved. We establish that, if certain conditions are met, optimal parameters exist, are unique, and can be found through a straightforward algorithm to any desired precision. Also, as the number of neurons grows the conditions of convergence become easier to fulfill. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are also explored by including linear constraints on parameters. According to our model, incorporating loops (with fixed or variable weights) will produce loss functions that train easier, because it assures the existence of a region where an iterative method converges.">

        <tr id="Optimizing complex and high-dimensional black-box functions is ubiquitous in science and engineering fields. Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants.

Following a recent idea of Agapiou and Castillo (2023), who show that heavy-tailed prior distributions achieve automatic adaptation to smoothness, we introduce a simple Bayesian deep learning prior based on heavy-tailed weights and ReLU activation. We show that the corresponding posterior distribution achieves near-optimal minimax contraction rates, simultaneously adaptive to both intrinsic dimension and smoothness of the underlying function, in a variety of contexts including nonparametric regression, geometric data and Besov spaces. While most works so far need a form of model selection built-in within the prior distribution, a key aspect of our approach is that it does not require to sample hyperparameters to learn the architecture of the network. We also provide variational Bayes counterparts of the results, that show that mean-field variational approximations still benefit from near-optimal theoretical support.">

        <tr id="When developing empirical equations, domain experts require these to be accurate and adhere to physical laws. Often, constants with unknown units need to be discovered alongside the equations. Traditional unit-aware genetic programming (GP) approaches cannot be used when unknown constants with undetermined units are included. This paper presents a method for dimensional analysis that propagates unknown units as ''jokers'' and returns the magnitude of unit violations. We propose three methods, namely evolutive culling, a repair mechanism, and a multi-objective approach, to integrate the dimensional analysis in the GP algorithm. Experiments on datasets with ground truth demonstrate comparable performance of evolutive culling and the multi-objective approach to a baseline without dimensional analysis. Extensive analysis of the results on datasets without ground truth reveals that the unit-aware algorithms make only low sacrifices in accuracy, while producing unit-adherent solutions. Overall, we presented a promising novel approach for developing unit-adherent empirical equations.">

While pixel-based XAI methods focus on identifying significant pixels, existing concept-based XAI methods use pre-defined or human-annotated concepts. The recently proposed Segment Anything Model (SAM) achieved a significant step forward to prepare automatic concept sets via comprehensive instance segmentation. Building upon this, the Explain Any Concept (EAC) model emerged as a flexible method for explaining DNN decisions. EAC model is based on using a surrogate model which has one trainable linear layer to simulate the target model. In this paper, by introducing an additional nonlinear layer to the original surrogate model, we show that we can improve the performance of the EAC model. We compare our proposed approach to the original EAC model and report improvements obtained on both ImageNet and MS COCO datasets.">

        <tr id="Estimating parameters of dynamic models from experimental data is a challenging, and often computationally-demanding task. It requires a large number of model simulations and objective function gradient computations, if gradient-based optimization is used. The gradient depends on derivatives of the state variables with respect to parameters, also called state sensitivities, which are expensive to compute. In many cases, steady-state computation is a part of model simulation, either due to steady-state data or an assumption that the system is at steady state at the initial time point. Various methods are available for steady-state and gradient computation. Yet, the most efficient pair of methods (one for steady states, one for gradients) for a particular model is often not clear. Moreover, depending on the model and the available data, some methods may not be applicable or sufficiently robust. In order to facilitate the selection of methods, we explore six method pairs for computing the steady state and sensitivities at steady state using six real-world problems. The method pairs involve numerical integration or Newton's method to compute the steady-state, and -- for both forward and adjoint sensitivity analysis -- numerical integration or a tailored method to compute the sensitivities at steady-state. Our evaluation shows that the two method pairs that combine numerical integration for the steady-state with a tailored method for the sensitivities at steady-state were the most robust, and amongst the most computationally-efficient. We also observed that while Newton's method for steady-state computation yields a substantial speedup compared to numerical integration, it may lead to a large number of simulation failures. Overall, our study provides a concise overview across current methods for computing sensitivities at steady state, guiding modelers to choose the right methods.">
