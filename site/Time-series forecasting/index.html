        <tr id="Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.">

        <tr id="In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different time points. Here, we introduce RAINDROP, a graph neural network that embeds irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. RAINDROP represents every sample as a separate sensor graph and models time-varying dependencies between sensors with a novel message passing operator. It estimates the latent sensor graph structure and leverages the structure together with nearby observations to predict misaligned readouts. This model can be interpreted as a graph neural network that sends messages over graphs that are optimized for capturing time-varying dependencies among sensors. We use RAINDROP to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. RAINDROP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.4% (absolute F1-score points), including techniques that deal with irregular sampling using fixed discretization and set functions. RAINDROP shows superiority in diverse setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have shown to be effective in time series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global) inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate predictions.">

        <tr id="Outstanding achievements of graph neural networks for spatiotemporal time series analysis show that relational constraints introduce an effective inductive bias into neural forecasting architectures. Often, however, the relational information characterizing the underlying data-generating process is unavailable and the practitioner is left with the problem of inferring from data which relational graph to use in the subsequent processing stages. We propose novel, principled - yet practical - probabilistic score-based methods that learn the relational dependencies as distributions over graphs while maximizing end-to-end the performance at task. The proposed graph learning framework is based on consolidated variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo score-based gradient estimation, is theoretically grounded, and, as we show, effective in practice. In this paper, we focus on the time series forecasting problem and show that, by tailoring the gradient estimators to the graph learning problem, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance while controlling the sparsity of the learned graph and the computational scalability. We empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that the proposed solution can be used as a stand-alone graph identification procedure as well as a graph learning component of an end-to-end forecasting architecture.">

        <tr id="Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic) graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed, recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions.">

        <tr id="By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.">

        <tr id="Attention mechanisms have been widely used to capture long-range dependencies among nodes in Graph Transformers. Bottlenecked by the quadratic computational cost, attention mechanisms fail to scale in large graphs. Recent improvements in computational efficiency are mainly achieved by attention sparsification with random or heuristic-based graph subsampling, which falls short in data-dependent context reasoning. State space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained prominence for their effectiveness and efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, adapting SSMs to non-sequential graph data presents a notable challenge. In this work, we introduce Graph-Mamba, the first attempt to enhance long-range context modeling in graph networks by integrating a Mamba block with the input-dependent node selection mechanism. Specifically, we formulate graph-centric node prioritization and permutation strategies to enhance context-aware reasoning, leading to a substantial improvement in predictive performance. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-range graph prediction tasks, with a fraction of the computational cost in both FLOPs and GPU memory consumption. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/Graph-Mamba.">

        <tr id="Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.">

        <tr id="Large pre-trained models excel in zero/few-shot learning for language and vision tasks but face challenges in multivariate time series (TS) forecasting due to diverse data characteristics. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1. Model weights for more sophisticated variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, and TTM-A) will be shared soon.

        <tr id="Pre-training on time series poses a unique challenge due to the potential mismatch between pre-training and target domains, such as shifts in temporal dynamics, fast-evolving trends, and long-range and short-cyclic effects, which can lead to poor downstream performance. While domain adaptation methods can mitigate these shifts, most methods need examples directly from the target domain, making them suboptimal for pre-training. To address this challenge, methods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and be capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training. Relative to other modalities, in time series, we expect that time-based and frequency-based representations of the same example are located close together in the time-frequency space. To this end, we posit that time-frequency consistency (TF-C) -- embedding a time-based neighborhood of an example close to its frequency-based neighborhood -- is desirable for pre-training. Motivated by TF-C, we define a decomposable pre-training model, where the self-supervised signal is provided by the distance between time and frequency components, each individually trained by contrastive estimation. We evaluate the new method on eight datasets, including electrodiagnostic testing, human activity recognition, mechanical fault detection, and physical status monitoring. Experiments against eight state-of-the-art methods show that TF-C outperforms baselines by 15.4% (F1 score) on average in one-to-one settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model on EMG data) and by 8.4% (precision) in challenging one-to-many settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model for either hand-gesture recognition or mechanical fault prediction), reflecting the breadth of scenarios that arise in real-world applications.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that Raincoat can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.">

The proposed AZ-test can be intended as a spatio-temporal extension of traditional tests designed for system identiﬁcation to graph signals. The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes over time, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as it is the case in many application scenarios like sensor and transportation networks. The asymptotic distribution of the designed test can be derived under the null hypothesis without assuming identically distributed data. We show the effectiveness of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and illustrate how it can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graph stream.">

Within this framework, relational inductive biases, e.g., associated with functional dependencies existing among signals, are not explicitly exploited leaving unattended great opportunities for effective modeling approaches. The manuscript aims, for the first time, at filling this gap by matching state-space modeling and spatio-temporal data where the relational information, say the functional graph capturing latent dependencies, is learned directly from data and is allowed to change over time. Within a probabilistic formulation that accounts for the uncertainty in the data-generating process, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn the state-space model end-to-end on a downstream task.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a pivotal role in many real-world applications. Recently, the utilization of Large Language Models (LLM) in TSF has demonstrated exceptional predictive performance, surpassing most task-specific forecasting models. The success of LLM-based forecasting methods underscores the importance of causal dependence modeling and pre-trained knowledge transfer. However, challenges persist in directly applying LLM to TSF, i.e., the unacceptable parameter scales for resource-intensive model optimization, and the significant gap of feature space between structural numerical time series and natural language. To this end, we propose LeRet, a Language-empowered Retentive network for TSF. Technically, inspired by the causal extraction in LLM, we propose a causal dependence learner, enhanced by a patch-level pre-training task, to capture sequential causal evolution. To minimize the gap between numeric and language, we initialize a language description protocol for time series and design a TS-related language knowledge extractor to learn from language description, avoiding training with large-scale parameters. Finally, we dedicatedly achieve a Language-TS Modality Integrator for the fusion of two types data, and enable language-empowered sequence forecasting. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our LeRet, especially reveal superiority on few-shot, and zero-shot forecasting tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/hqh0728/LeRet.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting (TSF) is crucial in fields like economic forecasting, weather prediction, traffic flow analysis, and public health surveillance. Real-world time series data often include noise, outliers, and missing values, making accurate forecasting challenging. Traditional methods model point-to-point relationships, which limits their ability to capture complex temporal patterns and increases their susceptibility to noise.To address these issues, we introduce the WindowMixer model, built on an all-MLP framework. WindowMixer leverages the continuous nature of time series by examining temporal variations from a window-based perspective. It decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components, handling them individually. For trends, a fully connected (FC) layer makes predictions. For seasonal components, time windows are projected to produce window tokens, processed by Intra-Window-Mixer and Inter-Window-Mixer modules. The Intra-Window-Mixer models relationships within each window, while the Inter-Window-Mixer models relationships between windows. This approach captures intricate patterns and long-range dependencies in the data.Experiments show WindowMixer consistently outperforms existing methods in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.">

Analyzing time series data is of great significance in real-world scenarios and has been widely studied over centuries. Recent years have witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in the time series community, with techniques shifting from traditional statistical methods to advanced deep learning models. In this paper, we delve into the design of deep time series models across various analysis tasks and review the existing literature from two perspectives: basic modules and model architectures. Further, we develop and release Time Series Library (TSLib) as a fair benchmark of deep time series models for diverse analysis tasks, which implements 24 mainstream models, covers 30 datasets from different domains, and supports five prevalent analysis tasks. Based on TSLib, we thoroughly evaluate 12 advanced deep time series models on different tasks. Empirical results indicate that models with specific structures are well-suited for distinct analytical tasks, which offers insights for research and adoption of deep time series models.

        <tr id="Long time series forecasting aims to utilize historical information to forecast future states over extended horizons. Traditional RNN-based series forecasting methods struggle to effectively address long-term dependencies and gradient issues in long time series problems. Recently, SegRNN has emerged as a leading RNN-based model tailored for long-term series forecasting, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a streamlined architecture through innovative segmentation and parallel decoding techniques. Nevertheless, SegRNN has several limitations: its fixed segmentation disrupts data continuity and fails to effectively leverage information across different segments, the segmentation strategy employed by SegRNN does not fundamentally address the issue of information loss within the recurrent structure. To address these issues, we propose the ISMRNN method with three key enhancements: we introduce an implicit segmentation structure to decompose the time series and map it to segmented hidden states, resulting in denser information exchange during the segmentation phase. Additionally, we incorporate residual structures in the encoding layer to mitigate information loss within the recurrent structure. To extract information more effectively, we further integrate the Mamba architecture to enhance time series information extraction. Experiments on several real-world long time series forecasting datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art models.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have raised questions about the suitability of the Transformer architecture for long sequence time-series forecasting. These forecasting models leverage Transformers to capture dependencies between multiple time steps in a time series, with embedding tokens composed of data from individual time steps. However, challenges arise when applying Transformers to predict long sequences with strong periodicity, leading to performance degradation and increased computational burden. Furthermore, embedding tokens formed one time step at a time may struggle to reveal meaningful information in long sequences, failing to capture correlations between different time steps. In this study, we propose Skip-Timeformer, a Transformer-based model that utilizes a skip-time interaction for long sequence time-series forecasting. Specifically, we decompose the time series into multiple subsequences based on different time intervals, embedding various time steps into variable tokens across multiple sequences. The skip-time interaction mechanism utilizes these variable tokens to capture dependencies in the skip-time dimension. Additionally, skip-time interaction is employed to learn dependencies between sequences missed by multiple skip time steps. The Skip-Timeformer model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets, further enhancing the long sequence forecasting capabilities of the Transformer variations and better adapting to arbitrary lookback windows.">

Recent works model the relations between time-series as graphs and have shown that propagating information over the relation graph can improve time series forecasting. However, in many cases, relational information is not available or is noisy and reliable. Moreover, most works ignore the underlying uncertainty of time-series both for structure learning and deriving the forecasts resulting in the structure not capturing the uncertainty resulting in forecast distributions with poor uncertainty estimates. We tackle this challenge and introduce STOIC, that leverages stochastic correlations between time-series to learn underlying structure between time-series and to provide well-calibrated and accurate forecasts. Over a wide-range of benchmark datasets STOIC provides around 16% more accurate and 14% better-calibrated forecasts. STOIC also shows better adaptation to noise in data during inference and captures important and useful relational information in various benchmarks.">

        <tr id="Deep models for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting have recently demonstrated significant success. Channel-dependent models capture complex dependencies that channel-independent models cannot capture. However, the number of channels in real-world applications outpaces the capabilities of existing channel-dependent models, and contrary to common expectations, some models underperform the channel-independent models in handling high-dimensional data, which raises questions about the performance of channel-dependent models. To address this, our study first investigates the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of these channel-dependent models on high-dimensional MTS data. Our analysis reveals that two primary issues lie in the introduced noise from unrelated series that increases the difficulty of capturing the crucial inter-channel dependencies, and challenges in training strategies due to high-dimensional data. To address these issues, we propose STHD, the Scalable Transformer for High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting. STHD has three components: a) Relation Matrix Sparsity that limits the noise introduced and alleviates the memory issue; b) ReIndex applied as a training strategy to enable a more flexible batch size setting and increase the diversity of training data; and c) Transformer that handles 2-D inputs and captures channel dependencies. These components jointly enable STHD to manage the high-dimensional MTS while maintaining computational feasibility. Furthermore, experimental results show STHD's considerable improvement on three high-dimensional datasets: Crime-Chicago, Wiki-People, and Traffic.

While popular Transformer-based predictive models can perform well, their quadratic computational complexity results in inefficiency and high overhead. The recently emerged Mamba, a selective state space model, has shown promising results in many fields due to its strong temporal feature extraction capabilities and linear computational complexity. However, due to the unilateral nature of Mamba, channel-independent predictive models based on Mamba cannot attend to the relationships among all variables in the manner of Transformer-based models. To address this issue, we combine fast-attention with Mamba to introduce a novel framework named FMamba for MTSF. Technically, we first extract the temporal features of the input variables through an embedding layer, then compute the dependencies among input variables via the fast-attention module. Subsequently, we use Mamba to selectively deal with the input features and further extract the temporal dependencies of the variables through the multi-layer perceptron block (MLP-block). Finally, FMamba obtains the predictive results through the projector, a linear layer. Experimental results on eight public datasets demonstrate that FMamba can achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational overhead.">

Specifically, we design three spatial augmented views to delve into the spatial information from the perspectives of local, global, and pivotal nodes. By combining three spatial augmented views with three parallel spatial self-attention mechanisms, the model can comprehensively captures spatial dependencies at different levels. We design a gated temporal self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal context broadcasting module is introduced between two spatio-temporal layers to ensure a well-distributed allocation of attention scores, alleviating overfitting and information loss, and enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the model. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on six well-known traffic benchmarks, the experimental results demonstrate that LVSTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competing baselines, with the maximum improvement reaching up to 4.32%.">

        <tr id="Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) has been widely applied in finance, traffic prediction, and other domains. Recently, patch-based transformers have emerged as a promising approach, segmenting data into sub-level patches that serve as input tokens. However, existing methods mostly rely on predetermined patch lengths, necessitating expert knowledge and posing challenges in capturing diverse characteristics across various scales. Moreover, time series data exhibit diverse variations and fluctuations across different temporal scales, which traditional approaches struggle to model effectively. In this paper, we propose a dynamic tokenizer with a dynamic sparse learning algorithm to capture diverse receptive fields and sparse patterns of time series data. In order to build hierarchical receptive fields, we develop a multi-scale Transformer model, coupled with multi-scale sequence extraction, capable of capturing multi-resolution features. Additionally, we introduce a group-aware rotary position encoding technique to enhance intra- and inter-group position awareness among representations across different temporal scales. Our proposed model, named DRFormer, is evaluated on various real-world datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its superiority compared to existing methods.

Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their development in understanding spatial-temporal data has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-LLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{LLM}s, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-LLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers as well as virtual nodes. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for LLMs to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data. Additionally, to capture the non-pairwise and higher-order correlations, we design a hypergraph learning module for LLMs, which can enhance the overall performance and improve efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-LLM exhibits strong performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-LLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot learning tasks.">

        <tr id="It is challenging to scale time series forecasting models such that they forecast accurately for multiple distinct domains and datasets, all with potentially different underlying collection procedures (e.g., sample resolution), patterns (e.g., periodicity), and prediction requirements (e.g., reconstruction vs. forecasting). We call this general task universal forecasting. Existing methods usually assume that input data is regularly sampled, and they forecast to pre-determined horizons, resulting in failure to generalise outside of the scope of their training. We propose the DAM - a neural model that takes randomly sampled histories and outputs an adjustable basis composition as a continuous function of time for forecasting to non-fixed horizons. It involves three key components: (1) a flexible approach for using randomly sampled histories from a long-tail distribution, that enables an efficient global perspective of the underlying temporal dynamics while retaining focus on the recent history; (2) a transformer backbone that is trained on these actively sampled histories to produce, as representational output, (3) the basis coefficients of a continuous function of time. We show that a single univariate DAM, trained on 25 time series datasets, either outperformed or closely matched existing SoTA models at multivariate long-term forecasting across 18 datasets, including 8 held-out for zero-shot transfer, even though these models were trained to specialise for each dataset-horizon combination. This single DAM excels at zero-shot transfer and very-long-term forecasting, performs well at imputation, is interpretable via basis function composition and attention, can be tuned for different inference-cost requirements, is robust to missing and irregularly sampled data {by design}.">

In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.">

        <tr id="Discrete-Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs), which are prevalent in real-world implementations and notable for their ease of data acquisition, have garnered considerable attention from both academic researchers and industry practitioners. The representation learning of DTDGs has been extensively applied to model the dynamics of temporally changing entities and their evolving connections. Currently, DTDG representation learning predominantly relies on GNN+RNN architectures, which manifest the inherent limitations of both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). GNNs suffer from the over-smoothing issue as the models architecture goes deeper, while RNNs struggle to capture long-term dependencies effectively. GNN+RNN architectures also grapple with scaling to large graph sizes and long sequences. Additionally, these methods often compute node representations separately and focus solely on individual node characteristics, thereby overlooking the behavior intersections between the two nodes whose link is being predicted, such as instances where the two nodes appear together in the same context or share common neighbors. This paper introduces a novel representation learning method DTFormer for DTDGs, pivoting from the traditional GNN+RNN framework to a Transformer-based architecture. Our approach exploits the attention mechanism to concurrently process topological information within the graph at each timestamp and temporal dynamics of graphs along the timestamps, circumventing the aforementioned fundamental weakness of both GNNs and RNNs. Moreover, we enhance the model's expressive capability by incorporating the intersection relationships among nodes and integrating a multi-patching module. Extensive experiments conducted on six public dynamic graph benchmark datasets confirm our model's efficacy, achieving the SOTA performance.">

Nevertheless, existing time series representation learning (TSRL) methods face challenges in attaining universality. Indeed, existing methods relying solely on one SSL strategy (either contrastive learning (CL) or generative) often fall short in capturing rich semantic information for various downstream tasks. Moreover, time series exhibit diverse distributions and inherent characteristics, particularly with the common occurrence of missing values, posing a notable challenge for existing backbones in effectively handling such diverse time series data. To bridge these gaps, we propose CTRL, a framework for universal TSRL. For the first time, we employ Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) as the backbone for TSRL, which captures the continuous processes and exhibits robustness to missing data. Additionally, a dual-task SSL strategy, integrating both reconstruction and contrasting tasks, is proposed to enrich the semantic information of the learned representations. Furthermore, novel hard negative construction and false negative elimination mechanisms are proposed to improve sampling efficiency and reduce sampling bias in CL. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CTRL in forecasting, classification, and imputation tasks, particularly its outstanding robustness to missing data.">

        <tr id="Transformer has gained widespread adoption in modeling time series due to the exceptional ability of its self-attention mechanism in capturing long-range dependencies. However, when processing time series data with numerous variates, the vanilla self-attention mechanism tends to distribute attention weights evenly and smoothly, causing row-homogenization in attention maps and further hampering time series forecasting. To tackle this issue, we propose an advanced Transformer architecture entitled SDformer, which designs two novel modules, Spectral-Filter-Transform (SFT) and Dynamic-Directional-Attention (DDA), and integrates them into the encoder of Transformer to achieve more intensive attention allocation. Specifically, the SFT module utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform to select the most prominent frequencies, along with a Hamming Window to smooth and denoise the filtered series data; The DDA module applies a specialized kernel function to the query and key vectors projected from the denoised data, concentrating this innovative attention mechanism more effectively on the most informative variates to obtain a sharper attention distribution. These two modules jointly enable attention weights to be more salient among numerous variates, which in turn enhances the attention's ability to capture multivariate correlations, improving the performance in forecasting. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate its superior performance over other state-of-the-art models. Code is available at https://github.com/zhouziyu02/SDformer.">

        <tr id="Current Transformer methods for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting (MTSF) are all based on the conventional attention mechanism. They involve sequence embedding and performing a linear projection of Q, K, and V, and then computing attention within this latent space. We have never delved into the attention mechanism to explore whether such a mapping space is optimal for MTSF. To investigate this issue, this study first proposes Frequency Spectrum attention (FSatten), a novel attention mechanism based on the frequency domain space. It employs the Fourier transform for embedding and introduces Multi-head Spectrum Scaling (MSS) to replace the conventional linear mapping of Q and K. FSatten can accurately capture the periodic dependencies between sequences and outperform the conventional attention without changing mainstream architectures. We further design a more general method dubbed Scaled Orthogonal attention (SOatten). We propose an orthogonal embedding and a Head-Coupling Convolution (HCC) based on the neighboring similarity bias to guide the model in learning comprehensive dependency patterns. Experiments show that FSatten and SOatten surpass the SOTA which uses conventional attention, making it a good alternative as a basic attention mechanism for MTSF.

Prolonging input length causes overfitting, rapidly deteriorating accuracy. Our research indicates that the overfitting is a combination reaction of the multi-scale pattern coupling in time series and the fixed focusing scale of current models. First, we find that the patterns exhibited by a time series across various scales are reflective of its multi-periodic nature, where each scale corresponds to specific period length. Second, We find that the token size predominantly dictates model behavior, as it determines the scale at which the model focuses and the context size it can accommodate. Our idea is to decouple the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series and to model each pattern with its corresponding period length as token size. We introduced a novel series-decomposition module(MPSD), and a Multi-Token Pattern Recognition neural network(MTPR), enabling the model to handle \textit{inputs up to $10\times$ longer}.

        <tr id="The non-stationary nature of real-world Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data presents forecasting models with a formidable challenge of the time-variant distribution of time series, referred to as distribution shift. Existing studies on the distribution shift mostly adhere to adaptive normalization techniques for alleviating temporal mean and covariance shifts or time-variant modeling for capturing temporal shifts. Despite improving model generalization, these normalization-based methods often assume a time-invariant transition between outputs and inputs but disregard specific intra-/inter-series correlations, while time-variant models overlook the intrinsic causes of the distribution shift. This limits model expressiveness and interpretability of tackling the distribution shift for MTS forecasting. To mitigate such a dilemma, we present a unified Probabilistic Graphical Model to Jointly capturing intra-/inter-series correlations and modeling the time-variant transitional distribution, and instantiate a neural framework called JointPGM for non-stationary MTS forecasting. Specifically, JointPGM first employs multiple Fourier basis functions to learn dynamic time factors and designs two distinct learners: intra-series and inter-series learners. The intra-series learner effectively captures temporal dynamics by utilizing temporal gates, while the inter-series learner explicitly models spatial dynamics through multi-hop propagation, incorporating Gumbel-softmax sampling. These two types of series dynamics are subsequently fused into a latent variable, which is inversely employed to infer time factors, generate final prediction, and perform reconstruction. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of JointPGM through extensive experiments on six highly non-stationary MTS datasets, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance of MTS forecasting.">

        <tr id="Tabular data is ubiquitous in many real-life systems. In particular, time-dependent tabular data, where rows are chronologically related, is typically used for recording historical events, e.g., financial transactions, healthcare records, or stock history. Recently, hierarchical variants of the attention mechanism of transformer architectures have been used to model tabular time-series data. At first, rows (or columns) are encoded separately by computing attention between their fields. Subsequently, encoded rows (or columns) are attended to one another to model the entire tabular time-series. While efficient, this approach constrains the attention granularity and limits its ability to learn patterns at the field-level across separate rows, or columns. We take a first step to address this gap by proposing Fieldy, a fine-grained hierarchical model that contextualizes fields at both the row and column levels. We compare our proposal against state of the art models on regression and classification tasks using public tabular time-series datasets. Our results show that combining row-wise and column-wise attention improves performance without increasing model size. Code and data are available at https://github.com/raphaaal/fieldy.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic and influenza outbreaks have underscored the critical need for predictive models that can effectively integrate spatial and temporal dynamics to enable accurate epidemic forecasting. Traditional time-series analysis approaches have fallen short in capturing the intricate interplay between these factors. Recent advancements have witnessed the incorporation of graph neural networks and machine learning techniques to bridge this gap, enhancing predictive accuracy and providing novel insights into disease spread mechanisms. Notable endeavors include leveraging human mobility data, employing transfer learning, and integrating advanced models such as Transformers and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to improve forecasting performance across diverse geographies for both influenza and COVID-19. However, these models often face challenges related to data quality, model transferability, and potential overfitting, highlighting the necessity for more adaptable and robust approaches. This paper introduces the Graph Attention-based Spatial Temporal (GAST) model, which employs graph attention networks (GATs) to overcome these limitations by providing a nuanced understanding of epidemic dynamics through a sophisticated spatio-temporal analysis framework. Our contributions include the development and validation of the GAST model, demonstrating its superior forecasting capabilities for influenza and COVID-19 spread, with a particular focus on short-term, daily predictions. The model’s application to both influenza and COVID-19 datasets showcases its versatility and potential to inform public health interventions across a range of infectious diseases.">

However, real-world time series data is seldom isolated and is frequently influenced by non-numeric factors. For instance, stock price fluctuations are impacted by daily random events in the broader world, with each event exerting a unique influence on price signals. Previously, forecasts in financial markets have been approached in two main ways: either as time-series problems over price sequence or sentiment analysis tasks. The sentiment analysis tasks aim to determine whether news events will have a positive or negative impact on stock prices, often categorizing them into discrete labels. Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to accurately model time series prediction, we propose a collaborative modeling framework that incorporates textual information about relevant events for predictions. Specifically, we leverage the intuition of large language models about future changes to update real number time series predictions.

Traditional methods for extracting knowledge from these graphs often depend on feature engineering or deep learning.

This paper introduces Deep-Graph-Sprints (DGS), a novel deep learning architecture designed for efficient representation learning on CTDGs with low-latency inference requirements. We benchmark DGS against state-of-the-art feature engineering and graph neural network methods using five diverse datasets.

Enormous efforts have been made to exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for modeling spatial correlations and temporal dependencies of traffic speed evolving patterns, regularized by graph topology. While achieving promising results, current traffic speed prediction methods still suffer from ignoring topology-free patterns, which cannot be captured by GNNs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a generic model for enabling the current GNN-based methods to preserve topology-free patterns. Specifically, we first develop a Dual Cross-Scale Transformer (DCST) architecture, including a Spatial Transformer and a Temporal Transformer, to preserve the cross-scale topology-free patterns and associated dynamics, respectively. Then, to further integrate both topology-regularized/-free patterns, we propose a distillation-style learning framework, in which the existing GNN-based methods are considered as the teacher model, and the proposed DCST architecture is considered as the student model. The teacher model would inject the learned topology-regularized patterns into the student model for integrating topology-free patterns. The extensive experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.">

        <tr id="Representing temporal-structured samples is essential for effective time series analysis tasks. So far, recurrent networks, convolution networks and transformer-style models have been successively applied in temporal data representation, yielding notable results. However, most existing methods primarily focus on modeling and representing the variation patterns within time series in the time domain. As a highly abstracted information entity, 1D time series couples various patterns such as trends, seasonality, and dramatic changes (instantaneous high dynamic), it is difficult to exploit these highly coupled properties merely by analysis tools on purely time domain. To this end, we present Spectrogram Analysis and Representation Network (SpecAR-Net). SpecAR-Net aims at learning more comprehensive representations by modeling raw time series in both time and frequency domain, where an efficient joint extraction of time-frequency features is achieved through a group of learnable 2D multi-scale parallel complex convolution blocks. Experimental results show that the SpecAR-Net achieves excellent performance on 5 major downstream tasks i.e., classification, anomaly detection, imputation, long- and short-term forecasting.

Given a collection of observed temporal graphs, is it possible to predict the evolution of an unseen network from the same domain? To answer this question, we first present the Temporal Graph Scaling (TGS) dataset, a large collection of temporal graphs consisting of eighty-four ERC20 token transaction networks collected from 2017 to 2023. Next, we evaluate the transferability of Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) for the temporal graph property prediction task by pre-training on a collection of up to sixty-four token transaction networks and then evaluating the downstream performance on twenty unseen token networks. We find that the neural scaling law observed in NLP and Computer Vision also applies in temporal graph learning, where pre-training on greater number of networks leads to improved downstream performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of the transferability of temporal graphs learning. On downstream token networks, the largest pre-trained model outperforms single model TGNNs on thirteen unseen test networks. Therefore, we believe that this is a promising first step towards building foundation models for temporal graphs.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has essential applications across various domains. For instance, forecasting power time series can optimize energy usage and bolster grid stability and reliability. Existing models based on transformer architecture are limited to classical design, ignoring the impact of spatial information and noise on model architecture design. Therefore, we propose an atypical design of Transformer-based models for multivariate time series forecasting. This design consists of two critical components: (i) spectral clustering center of time series employed as the focal point for attention computation; (ii) alternating attention mechanism wherein each query transformer is compatible with spectral clustering centers, executing attention at the sequence level instead of the token level. The alternating design has a two-fold benefit: firstly, it eliminates the uncertainty noise present in the dependent variable sequence of the channel input, and secondly, it incorporates the Euclidean distance to mitigate the impact of extreme values on the attention matrix, thereby aligning predictions more closely to the sequence's natural progression. Experiments on ten real-world datasets, encompassing Wind, Electricity, Weather, and others, demonstrate that our Spectral Central Alternating Transformer (SCAT) outperforms state-of-the-art methods (SOTA) by an average of 42.8% in prediction performance in power time series forecasting.">

Although recent research has proposed data-driven techniques for forecasting skill demand, the focus has remained predominantly on overall trends rather than occupational granularity. In this paper, we propose a novel Pre-training Enhanced Dynamic Graph Autoencoder (Pre-DyGAE), forecasting skill demand from an occupational perspective. Specifically, we aggregate job descriptions (JDs) by occupation and segment them into several timestamps. Subsequently, in the initial timestamps, we pre-train a graph autoencoder (GAE), consisting of a semantically-aware cross-attention enhanced uncertainty-aware encoder and decoders for link prediction and edge regression to achieve graph reconstruction. In particular, we utilize contrastive learning on skill cooccurrence clusters to solve the data sparsity and a unified Tweedie and ranking loss for predicting the imbalanced distribution. Afterward, we incorporate an adaptive temporal encoding unit and a temporal shift module into GAE to achieve a dynamic GAE (DyGAE). Furthermore, we fine-tune the DyGAE with a two-stage optimization strategy and infer future representations. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of Pre-DyGAE compared with state-of-the-art baselines.">

This representation can be extended to a quintuple by adding a fifth element: a textual summary that briefly describes the event. These quadruples or quintuples, when organized within a specific domain, form a temporal knowledge graph (TKG). Current learning frameworks focus on a few TKG-related tasks, such as predicting an object given a subject and a relation or forecasting the occurrences of multiple types of events (i.e., relation) in the next time window. They typically rely on complex structural and sequential models like graph neural networks (GNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to update intermediate embeddings. However, these methods often neglect the contextual information inherent in each quintuple, which can be effectively captured through concise textual descriptions. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can streamline the design of TKG learning frameworks while maintaining competitive accuracy in prediction and forecasting tasks. We develop multiple prompt templates to frame the object prediction (OP) task as a standard question-answering (QA) task, suitable for instruction fine-tuning with an encoder-decoder generative LLM. For multi-event forecasting (MEF), we design simple yet effective prompt templates for each TKG quintuple. This novel approach removes the need for GNNs and RNNs, instead utilizing an encoder-only LLM to generate fixed intermediate embeddings, which are subsequently processed by a prediction head with a self-attention mechanism to forecast potential future relations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets using various evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.">

We achieve the spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting task by integrating S-RetNet and T-RetNet to form ST-RetNet.

        <tr id="Temporal graphs have gained increasing importance due to their ability to model dynamically evolving relationships. These graphs can be represented through either a stream of edge events or a sequence of graph snapshots. Until now, the development of machine learning methods for both types has occurred largely in isolation, resulting in limited experimental comparison and theoretical crosspollination between the two. In this paper, we introduce Unified Temporal Graph (UTG), a framework that unifies snapshot-based and event-based machine learning models under a single umbrella, enabling models developed for one representation to be applied effectively to datasets of the other. We also propose a novel UTG training procedure to boost the performance of snapshot-based models in the streaming setting. We comprehensively evaluate both snapshot and event-based models across both types of temporal graphs on the temporal link prediction task. Our main findings are threefold: first, when combined with UTG training, snapshotbased models can perform competitively with event-based models such as TGN and GraphMixer even on event datasets. Second, snapshot-based models are at least an order of magnitude faster than most event-based models during inference. Third, while event-based methods such as NAT and DyGFormer outperforms snapshotbased methods on both types of temporal graphs, this is because they leverage joint neighborhood structural features thus emphasizing the potential to incorporate these features into snapshot-based models as well. These findings highlight the importance of comparing model architectures independent of the data format and suggest the potential of combining the efficiency of snapshot-based models with the performance of event-based models in the future.">

        <tr id="Demand prediction is a crucial task for e-commerce and physical retail businesses, especially during high-stake sales events. However, the limited availability of historical data from these peak periods poses a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages strategically chosen proxy data reflective of potential sales patterns from similar entities during non-peak periods, enriched by features learned from a graph neural networks (GNNs)-based forecasting model, to predict demand during peak events. We formulate the demand prediction as a meta-learning problem and develop the Feature-based First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (F-FOMAML) algorithm that leverages proxy data from non-peak periods and GNN-generated relational metadata to learn feature-specific layer parameters, thereby adapting to demand forecasts for peak events. Theoretically, we show that by considering domain similarities through task-specific metadata, our model achieves improved generalization, where the excess risk decreases as the number of training tasks increases. Empirical evaluations on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Compared to existing state-of-the-art models, our method demonstrates a notable improvement in demand prediction accuracy, reducing the Mean Absolute Error by 26.24% on an internal vending machine dataset and by 1.04% on the publicly accessible JD.com dataset.">

However, in many sequence modeling problems, the underlying process is inherently modular and it is of interest to have inductive biases that mimic this modular structure. In this paper, we introduce SlotSSMs, a novel framework for incorporating independent mechanisms into SSMs to preserve or encourage separation of information. Unlike conventional SSMs that maintain a monolithic state vector, SlotSSMs maintains the state as a collection of multiple vectors called slots. Crucially, the state transitions are performed independently per slot with sparse interactions across slots implemented via the bottleneck of self-attention. In experiments, we evaluate our model in object-centric video understanding, 3D visual reasoning, and video prediction tasks, which involve modeling multiple objects and their long-range temporal dependencies. We find that our proposed design offers substantial performance gains over existing sequence modeling methods.">

Time series classification, the task of categorizing sequential data, has gained prominence, with machine learning approaches demonstrating remarkable performance on public benchmark datasets. However, progress has primarily been in designing architectures for learning representations from raw data at fixed (or ideal) time scales, which can fail to generalize to longer sequences. This work introduces a \textit{compositional representation learning} approach trained on statistically coherent components extracted from sequential data. Based on a multi-scale change space, an unsupervised approach is proposed to segment the sequential data into chunks with similar statistical properties. A sequence-based encoder model is trained in a multi-task setting to learn compositional representations from these temporal components for time series classification. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on publicly available time series classification benchmarks. Evaluating the coherence of segmented components shows its competitive performance on the unsupervised segmentation task.">

        <tr id="Hierarchical time-series forecasting (HTSF) is an important problem for many real-world business applications where the goal is to simultaneously forecast multiple time-series that are related to each other via a hierarchical relation. Recent works, however, do not address two important challenges that are typically observed in many demand forecasting applications at large companies. First, many time-series at lower levels of the hierarchy have high sparsity i.e., they have a significant number of zeros. Most HTSF methods do not address this varying sparsity across the hierarchy. Further, they do not scale well to the large size of the real-world hierarchy typically unseen in benchmarks used in literature. We resolve both these challenges by proposing HAILS, a novel probabilistic hierarchical model that enables accurate and calibrated probabilistic forecasts across the hierarchy by adaptively modeling sparse and dense time-series with different distributional assumptions and reconciling them to adhere to hierarchical constraints. We show the scalability and effectiveness of our methods by evaluating them against real-world demand forecasting datasets. We deploy HAILS at a large chemical manufacturing company for a product demand forecasting application with over ten thousand products and observe a significant 8.5\% improvement in forecast accuracy and 23% better improvement for sparse time-series. The enhanced accuracy and scalability make HAILS a valuable tool for improved business planning and customer experience.">

        <tr id="The Variable Subset Forecasting (VSF) problem, where the majority of variables are unavailable in the inference stage of multivariate forecasting, has been an important but under-explored task with broad impacts in many real-world applications. Missing values, absent inter-correlation, and the impracticality of retraining largely hinder the ability of multivariate forecasting models to capture inherent relationships among variables, impacting their performance. However, existing approaches towards these issues either heavily rely on local temporal correlation or face limitations in fully recovering missing information from the unavailable subset, accompanied by notable computational expenses. To address these problems, we propose a novel density estimation solution to recover the information of missing variables via flows-based generative framework. In particular, a novel generative network for time series, namely Time-series Reconstruction Flows (TRF), is proposed to estimate and reconstruct the missing variable subset. In addition, a novel meta-training framework, Variable-Agnostic Meta Learning, has been developed to enhance the generalization ability of TRF, enabling it to adapt to diverse missing variables situations.

        <tr id="Implicit graph neural networks have gained popularity in recent years as they capture long-range dependencies while improving predictive performance in static graphs. Despite the tussle between performance degradation due to the oversmoothing of learned embeddings and long-range dependency being more pronounced in dynamic graphs, as features are aggregated both across neighborhood and time, no prior work has proposed an implicit graph neural model in a dynamic setting. In this paper, we present Implicit Dynamic Graph Neural Network (IDGNN) a novel implicit neural network for dynamic graphs which is the first of its kind. A key characteristic of IDGNN is that it demonstrably is well-posed, i.e., it is theoretically guaranteed to have a fixed-point representation. We then demonstrate that the standard iterative algorithm often used to train implicit models is computationally expensive in our dynamic setting as it involves computing gradients, which themselves have to be estimated in an iterative manner. To overcome this, we pose an equivalent bilevel optimization problem and propose an efficient single-loop training algorithm that avoids iterative computation by maintaining moving averages of key components of the gradients. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets on both classification and regression tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art baselines. We also demonstrate that our bi-level optimization framework maintains the performance of the expensive iterative algorithm while obtaining up to \textbf{1600x} speed-up.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces BiLSTM-MLAM, a novel multi-scale time series prediction model. Initially, the approach utilizes bidirectional long short-term memory to capture information from both forward and backward directions in time series data. Subsequently, a multi-scale patch segmentation module generates various long sequences composed of equal-length segments, enabling the model to capture data patterns across multiple time scales by adjusting segment lengths. Finally, the local attention mechanism enhances feature extraction by accurately identifying and weighting important time segments, thereby strengthening the model’s understanding of the local features of the time series, followed by feature fusion. The model demonstrates outstanding performance in time series prediction tasks by effectively capturing sequence information across various time scales. Experimental validation illustrates the superior performance of BiLSTM-MLAM compared to six baseline methods across multiple datasets. When predicting the remaining life of aircraft engines, BiLSTM-MLAM outperforms the best baseline model by 6.66% in RMSE and 11.50% in MAE. In the LTE dataset, it achieves RMSE improvements of 12.77% and MAE enhancements of 3.06%, while in the load dataset, it demonstrates RMSE enhancements of 17.96% and MAE improvements of 30.39%. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the positive impact of each module on prediction accuracy. Through segment length parameter tuning experiments, combining different segment lengths has resulted in lower prediction errors, affirming the effectiveness of the multi-scale fusion strategy in enhancing prediction accuracy by integrating information from multiple time scales.">

        <tr id="While most time series are non-stationary, it is inevitable for models to face the distribution shift issue in time series forecasting. Existing solutions manipulate statistical measures (usually mean and std.) to adjust time series distribution. However, these operations can be theoretically seen as the transformation towards zero frequency component of the spectrum which cannot reveal full distribution information and would further lead to information utilization bottleneck in normalization, thus hindering forecasting performance. To address this problem, we propose to utilize the whole frequency spectrum to transform time series to make full use of data distribution from the frequency perspective. We present a deep frequency derivative learning framework, DERITS, for non-stationary time series forecasting. Specifically, DERITS is built upon a novel reversible transformation, namely Frequency Derivative Transformation (FDT) that makes signals derived in the frequency domain to acquire more stationary frequency representations. Then, we propose the Order-adaptive Fourier Convolution Network to conduct adaptive frequency filtering and learning. Furthermore, we organize DERITS as a parallel-stacked architecture for the multi-order derivation and fusion for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several datasets which show the consistent superiority in both time series forecasting and shift alleviation.">

Traditional stock price prediction models often only consider time-series data and are limited by the mechanisms of the models themselves. Some deep learning models have high computational costs, depend on a large amount of high-quality data, and have poor interpretations, making it difficult to intuitively understand the driving factors behind the predictions. Some studies have used deep learning models to extract text features and combine them with price data to make joint predictions, but there are issues with dealing with information noise, accurate extraction of text sentiment, and how to efficiently fuse text and numerical data. To address these issues in this paper, we propose a background-aware multi-source fusion financial trend forecasting mechanism. The system leverages a large language model to extract key information from policy and stock review texts, utilizing the MacBERT model to generate feature vectors. These vectors are then integrated with stock price data to form comprehensive feature representations. These integrated features are input into a neural network comprising various deep learning architectures. By integrating multiple data sources, the system offers a holistic view of market dynamics. It harnesses the comprehensive analytical and interpretative capabilities of large language models, retaining deep semantic and sentiment information from policy texts to provide richer input features for stock trend prediction. Additionally, we compare the accuracy of six models (LSTM, BiLSTM, MogrifierLSTM, GRU, ST-LSTM, SwinLSTM). The results demonstrate that our system achieves generally better accuracy in predicting stock movements, attributed to the incorporation of large language model processing, policy information, and other influential features.">

Current practices for evaluating and comparing forecasting models focus on summarising performance into a single score, using metrics such as SMAPE. We hypothesize that averaging performance over all samples dilutes relevant information about the relative performance of models. Particularly, conditions in which this relative performance is different than the overall accuracy. We address this limitation by proposing a novel framework for evaluating univariate time series forecasting models from multiple perspectives, such as one-step ahead forecasting versus multi-step ahead forecasting. We show the advantages of this framework by comparing a state-of-the-art deep learning approach with classical forecasting techniques. While classical methods (e.g. ARIMA) are long-standing approaches to forecasting, deep neural networks (e.g. NHITS) have recently shown state-of-the-art forecasting performance in benchmark datasets. We conducted extensive experiments that show NHITS generally performs best, but its superiority varies with forecasting conditions. For instance, concerning the forecasting horizon, NHITS only outperforms classical approaches for multi-step ahead forecasting. Another relevant insight is that, when dealing with anomalies, NHITS is outperformed by methods such as Theta. These findings highlight the importance of aspect-based model evaluation.">

        <tr id="Despite the success of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) in modeling real-world Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), challenges such as expressiveness limitations and over-smoothing have prompted researchers to explore Graph Transformers (GTs) for enhanced HIN representation learning. However, research on GT in HINs remains limited, with two key shortcomings in existing work: (1) A node's neighbors at different distances in HINs convey diverse semantics. Unfortunately, existing methods ignore such differences and uniformly treat neighbors within a given distance in a coarse manner, which results in semantic confusion. (2) Nodes in HINs have various types, each with unique semantics. Nevertheless, existing methods mix nodes of different types during neighbor aggregation, hindering the capture of proper correlations between nodes of diverse types. To bridge these gaps, we design an innovative structure named (k,t)-ring neighborhood, where nodes are initially organized by their distance, forming different non-overlapping k-ring neighborhoods for each distance. Within each k-ring structure, nodes are further categorized into different groups according to their types, thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of both distances and types in HINs naturally. Based on this structure, we propose a novel Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HHGT) model, which seamlessly integrates a Type-level Transformer for aggregating nodes of different types within each k-ring neighborhood, followed by a Ring-level Transformer for aggregating different k-ring neighborhoods in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on downstream tasks to verify HHGT's superiority over 14 baselines, with a notable improvement of up to 24.75% in NMI and 29.25% in ARI for node clustering task on the ACM dataset compared to the best baseline.">

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.">

In this study, we introduce the Hierarchical Support Graph (HSG), an extension of the virtual node concept created through recursive coarsening of the original graph. This approach provides a flexible framework for enhancing information flow in graphs, independent of the specific MPNN layers utilized.

Currently, latent diffusion models are ascending to the forefront of generative modeling for many important data representations. Being the most pivotal in the computer vision domain, latent diffusion models have also recently attracted interest in other communities, including NLP, Speech, and Geometric Space. In this work, we propose TimeLDM, a novel latent diffusion model for high-quality time series generation. TimeLDM is composed of a variational autoencoder that encodes time series into an informative and smoothed latent content and a latent diffusion model operating in the latent space to generate latent information. We evaluate the ability of our method to generate synthetic time series with simulated and realistic datasets, benchmark the performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed TimeLDM persistently delivers high-quality generated time series. Sores from Context-FID and Discriminative indicate that TimeLDM consistently and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art benchmarks with an average improvement of 3.4$\times$ and 3.8$\times$, respectively. Further studies demonstrate that our method presents better performance on different lengths of time series data generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the potential of the latent diffusion model for unconditional time series generation and establish a new baseline for synthetic time series.">

Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

This paper explores fine-tuning LLMs for stock return forecasting with financial newsflow. In quantitative investing, return forecasting is fundamental for subsequent tasks like stock picking, portfolio optimization, etc. We formulate the model to include text representation and forecasting modules. We propose to compare the encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs, considering they generate text representations in distinct ways. The impact of these different representations on forecasting performance remains an open question. Meanwhile, we compare two simple methods of integrating LLMs' token-level representations into the forecasting module. The experiments on real news and investment universes reveal that: (1) aggregated representations from LLMs' token-level embeddings generally produce return predictions that enhance the performance of long-only and long-short portfolios; (2) in the relatively large investment universe, the decoder LLMs-based prediction model leads to stronger portfolios, whereas in the small universes, there are no consistent winners. Among the three LLMs studied (DeBERTa, Mistral, Llama), Mistral performs more robustly across different universes; (3) return predictions derived from LLMs' text representations are a strong signal for portfolio construction, outperforming conventional sentiment scores.">

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

RNN-based methods have shown promising potential due to their strong ability to model the interaction of time and variables. However, they are prone to gradient issues like gradient explosion and vanishing gradients. And the prediction accuracy is not high. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Fractional-order Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Network with a Frequency-domain Gated Attention mechanism (FLRNN-FGA). There are three major components: the Fractional-order Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Network (FLRNN), frequency module, and gated attention mechanism. In the FLRNN, fractional-order integration is employed to describe the dynamic systems accurately. It can capture long-term dependencies and improve prediction accuracy. Lipschitz weight matrices are applied to alleviate the gradient issues. In the frequency module, temporal data are transformed into the frequency domain by Fourier transform. Frequency domain processing can reduce the computational complexity of the model. In the gated attention mechanism, the gated structure can regulate attention information transmission to reduce the number of model parameters. Extensive experimental results on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLRNN-FGA compared with the state-of-the-art methods.">

        <tr id="Temporal causal discovery is a crucial task aimed at uncovering the causal relations within time series data. The latest temporal causal discovery methods usually train deep learning models on prediction tasks to uncover the causality between time series. They capture causal relations by analyzing the parameters of some components of the trained models, e.g., attention weights and convolution weights. However, this is an incomplete mapping process from the model parameters to the causality and fails to investigate the other components, e.g., fully connected layers and activation functions, that are also significant for causal discovery. To facilitate the utilization of the whole deep learning models in temporal causal discovery, we proposed an interpretable transformer-based causal discovery model termed CausalFormer, which consists of the causality-aware transformer and the decomposition-based causality detector. The causality-aware transformer learns the causal representation of time series data using a prediction task with the designed multi-kernel causal convolution which aggregates each input time series along the temporal dimension under the temporal priority constraint. Then, the decomposition-based causality detector interprets the global structure of the trained causality-aware transformer with the proposed regression relevance propagation to identify potential causal relations and finally construct the causal graph. Experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CausalFormer on discovering temporal causality.

Traditional time-series models segment data into windows and assign one label per window, often missing label transitions within those windows. This paper presents a novel many-to-many time-series model and post-processing using hybrid recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms, which more effectively captures label transitions over traditional many-to-one models. Further, unlike typical other many-to-many models, our approach doesn’t require a decoder. Instead, it employs an RNN, generating a label for every input time step. During inference, a weighted voting scheme consolidates overlapping predictions into one label per time step. Experiments show our model remains effective on time-series with sparse label shifts, but particularly excels in detecting frequent transitions. This model is ideal for tasks demanding accurate pinpointing of rapid label changes in time-series data, such as gesture recognition, making it ideal for fast-paced human activity recognition. 1">

These models typically involve a decoder trained using either its previous forecasts or the actual observed values as the decoder inputs. However, relying on self-generated predictions can lead to the rapid accumulation of errors over multiple steps, while using the actual observations introduces exposure bias as these values are unavailable during the extrapolation stage. In this regard, this study proposes a novel training approach called reinforced decoder, which introduces auxiliary models to generate alternative decoder inputs that remain accessible when extrapolating. Additionally, a reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to dynamically select the optimal inputs to improve accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms representative training methods over several datasets.

        <tr id="The modelling of temporal patterns in dynamic graphs is an important current research issue in the development of time-aware GNNs. Whether or not a specific sequence of events in a temporal graph constitutes a temporal pattern not only depends on the frequency of its occurrence. We consider whether it deviates from what is expected in a temporal graph where timestamps are randomly shuffled. While accounting for such a random baseline is important to model temporal patterns, it has mostly been ignored by current temporal graph neural networks. To address this issue we propose HYPA-DBGNN, a novel two-step approach that combines (i) the inference of anomalous sequential patterns in time series data on graphs based on a statistically principled null model, with (ii) a neural message passing approach that utilizes a higher-order De Bruijn graph whose edges capture overrepresented sequential patterns. Our method leverages hypergeometric graph ensembles to identify anomalous edges within both first- and higher-order De Bruijn graphs, which encode the temporal ordering of events. The model introduces an inductive bias that enhances model interpretability. We evaluate our approach for static node classification using benchmark datasets and a synthetic dataset that showcases its ability to incorporate the observed inductive bias regarding over- and under-represented temporal edges. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in detecting similar patterns within empirical datasets, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods in node classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce statistically informed GNNs that leverage temporal and causal sequence anomalies. HYPA-DBGNN represents a path for bridging the gap between statistical graph inference and neural graph representation learning, with potential applications to static GNNs.">

        <tr id="Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting. Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various input formats and retrieval augmented generation(RAG) modules. From extensive experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast, incorporating raw texts in specific complex events and fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance. Moreover, enhanced with retrieval modules, LLM can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. Meanwhile, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem still persist in LLMs, particularly in the RAG-based method. These findings not only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also highlight several promising research directions.We consider that this comprehensive evaluation, along with the identified research opportunities, will significantly contribute to future research on temporal event forecasting through LLMs.">

        <tr id="Modern recurrent layers are emerging as a promising path toward edge deployment of foundation models, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs). Compressing the whole input sequence in a finite-dimensional representation enables recurrent layers to model long-range dependencies while maintaining a constant inference cost for each token and a fixed memory requirement. However, the practical deployment of LLMs in resource-limited environments often requires further model compression, such as quantization and pruning. While these techniques are well-established for attention-based models, their effects on recurrent layers remain underexplored. In this preliminary work, we focus on post-training quantization for recurrent LLMs and show that Mamba models exhibit the same pattern of outlier channels observed in attention-based LLMs. We show that the reason for the difficulty of quantizing SSMs is caused by activation outliers, similar to those observed in transformer-based LLMs. We report baseline results for post-training quantization of Mamba that do not take into account the activation outliers and suggest first steps for outlier-aware quantization.">

        <tr id="How to capture dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies remains an open question in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Although recent advanced spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) achieve superior forecasting performance, they either consider pre-defined spatial correlations or simply learn static graphs. Some research has tried to learn many adjacent matrices to reveal time-varying spatial correlations, but they generate discrete graphs which cannot encode evolutionary information and also face computational complexity problem. In this paper, we propose two significant plugins to help automatically learn enhanced dynamic spatial-temporal embedding of MTS data: (1) a novel neural conditional random field (CRF) layer. We find that the implicit time-varying spatial dependencies are reflected by the explicit changeable links between edges, and we propose the neural CRF to encode such pairwise changeable evolutionary inter-dependencies; (2) a structure adaptive graph convolution (SAGC) that does not require pre-defined graphs to capture semantically richer spatial correlations. Then, we integrate the neural CRF, SAGC with recurrent neural network to develop a new STGNN paradigm termed Adaptive Spatial-Temporal graph neural network with Conditional Random Field (ASTCRF), which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. We validate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of ASTCRF on five public benchmark MTS datasets.">

        <tr id="Time Series Classification (TSC) encompasses two settings: classifying entire sequences or classifying segmented subsequences. The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of Con4m in handling segmented TSC tasks on MVD.">

The accuracy of prediction models is influenced by various factors, including nonlinearity, seasonality, and economic shocks. Deep learning has demonstrated better forecasts of stock prices than traditional approaches. This study, therefore, proposed a new approach to improve forecasting system based on an end-to-end convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with attention mechanism. Our approach first investigates local stock price features using 1D convolutional neural network, and then employs a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network for forecasting. This model stands out by effectively utilizing contextual data and representing the temporal character of data. The Bi-LSTM is helpful for understanding the history and future contextual information since it uncovers both past and future contexts of stock data. Furthermore, integrating attention mechanism within the CRNN represents a significant improvement. This allows our model to handle long input sequences more effectively and capture the inherent stochasticity in stock prices, which is often missed by traditional models. The effectiveness of our approach is investigated using data on 10 stock indexes from Yahoo Finance. The results show that our method outperforms ARIMA, LSTM, and conventional methods. ">

This study proposes a multi-scale graph wavelet temporal convolution network (MSGWTCN) to predict the traffic states in complex transportation networks. Specifically, a multi-scale spatial block is designed to simultaneously capture the spatial information at different levels, and the gated temporal convolution network is employed to extract the temporal dependencies of the data. The model jointly learns to mount multiple levels of the spatial interactions by stacking graph wavelets with different scales. Two real-world datasets are used in this study to investigate the model performance, including a highway network in Seattle and a dense road network of Manhattan in New York City. Experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models. Furthermore, different scales of graph wavelets are found to be effective in extracting local, intermediate and global information at the same time and thus enable the model to learn a complex transportation network topology with various types of road segments. By carefully customizing the scales of wavelets, the model is able to improve the prediction performance and better adapt to different network configurations.">

The model integrates a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a period-to-period attention mechanism for multistep prediction in the financial time series. Additionally, we introduce a self-correlation learning method and routing mechanism to handle complex multi-period aggregations and information distribution. Main contributions include proposing a novel period-aggregation representation scheme, introducing a new attention mechanism, and validating the model’s superiority in long-horizon prediction tasks. The LPAST model demonstrates its potential and effectiveness in financial market prediction, highlighting its relevance in financial research and predictive analytics.">

        <tr id="Many of today's data is time-series data originating from various sources, such as sensors, transaction systems, or production systems. Major challenges with such data include privacy and business sensitivity. Generative time-series models have the potential to overcome these problems, allowing representative synthetic data, such as people's movement in cities, to be shared openly and be used to the benefit of society at large. However, contemporary approaches are limited to prohibitively short sequences and small scales. Aside from major memory limitations, the models generate less accurate and less representative samples the longer the sequences are. This issue is further exacerbated by the lack of a comprehensive and accessible benchmark. Furthermore, a common need in practical applications is what-if analysis and dynamic adaptation to data distribution changes, for usage in decision making and to manage a changing world: What if this road is temporarily blocked or another road is added? The focus of this paper is on mobility data, such as people's movement in cities, requiring all these issues to be addressed. To this end, we propose a transformer-based diffusion model, TDDPM, for time-series which outperforms and scales substantially better than state-of-the-art. This is evaluated in a new comprehensive benchmark across several sequence lengths, standard datasets, and evaluation measures. We also demonstrate how the model can be conditioned on a prior over spatial occupancy frequency information, allowing the model to generate mobility data for previously unseen environments and for hypothetical scenarios where the underlying road network and its usage changes. This is evaluated by training on mobility data from part of a city. Then, using only aggregate spatial information as prior, we demonstrate out-of-distribution generalization to the unobserved remainder of the city.">

In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs, specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA3, in detecting and explaining anomalies in time series. Our studies reveal that: 1) LLMs cannot be directly used for time series anomaly detection. 2) By designing prompt strategies such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting, GPT-4 can detect time series anomalies with results competitive to baseline methods. 3) We propose a synthesized dataset to automatically generate time series anomalies with corresponding explanations. By applying instruction fine-tuning on this dataset, LLaMA3 demonstrates improved performance in time series anomaly detection tasks.

        <tr id="Crime forecasting is a critical component of urban analysis and essential for stabilizing society today. Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime incidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time periods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with this sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian nature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and over-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and convolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of crime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model, STMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing prediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation on real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models, providing a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.">

        <tr id="To generate coherent responses, language models infer unobserved meaning from their input text sequence. One potential explanation for this capability arises from theories of delay embeddings in dynamical systems, which prove that unobserved variables can be recovered from the history of only a handful of observed variables. To test whether language models are effectively constructing delay embeddings, we measure the capacities of sequence models to reconstruct unobserved dynamics. We trained 1-layer transformer decoders and state-space sequence models on next-step prediction from noisy, partially-observed time series data. We found that each sequence layer can learn a viable embedding of the underlying system. However, state-space models have a stronger inductive bias than transformers-in particular, they more effectively reconstruct unobserved information at initialization, leading to more parameter-efficient models and lower error on dynamics tasks. Our work thus forges a novel connection between dynamical systems and deep learning sequence models via delay embedding theory.">

In order to improve information sharing across locations, we propose a graph neural network architecture for ensemble post-processing, which represents the station locations as nodes on a graph and utilizes an attention mechanism to identify relevant predictive information from neighboring locations. In a case study on 2-m temperature forecasts over Europe, the graph neural network model shows substantial improvements over a highly competitive neural network-based post-processing method.">

However, the finance sector presents a distinct challenge due to its dependence on time-series data for complex forecasting tasks.

Our framework directs the LLMs to create background knowledge through a fill-in-the-blank strategy and then discerns potential factors affecting stock prices from related news. Guided by background knowledge and identified factors, we leverage historical stock prices in textual format to predict stock movement. An extensive evaluation of the LLMFactor framework across four benchmark datasets from both the U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrates its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods and its effectiveness in financial time-series forecasting.">

        <tr id="The prediction of time series is a challenging task relevant in such diverse applications as analyzing financial data, forecasting flow dynamics or understanding biological processes. Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to existing approaches.">

In recent years, researchers have primarily concentrated on developing specific model architectures for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) in order to improve the representation quality of temporal nodes and edges. However, limited attention has been given to the quality of negative samples during the training of TGNNs. When compared with static networks, temporal networks present two specific challenges for negative sampling: positive sparsity and positive shift. Positive sparsity refers to the presence of a single positive sample amidst numerous negative samples at each timestamp, while positive shift relates to the variations in positive samples across different timestamps. To robustly address these challenges in training TGNNs, we introduce Curriculum Negative Mining (CurNM), a model-aware curriculum learning framework that adaptively adjusts the difficulty of negative samples. Within this framework, we first establish a dynamically updated negative pool that balances random, historical, and hard negatives to address the challenges posed by positive sparsity. Secondly, we implement a temporal-aware negative selection module that focuses on learning from the disentangled factors of recently active edges, thus accurately capturing shifting preferences. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets and 3 TGNNs demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin. Additionally, thorough ablation studies and parameter sensitivity experiments verify the usefulness and robustness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/zziyue83/CurNM.">

However, existing channel prediction methods lack precision due to model mismatch errors or network generalization issues. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful modeling and generalization abilities, and have been successfully applied to cross-modal tasks, including the time series analysis. Leveraging the expressive power of LLMs, we propose a pre-trained LLM-empowered channel prediction method (LLM4CP) to predict the future downlink channel state information (CSI) sequence based on the historical uplink CSI sequence. We fine-tune the network while freezing most of the parameters of the pre-trained LLM for better cross-modality knowledge transfer. To bridge the gap between the channel data and the feature space of the LLM, preprocessor, embedding, and output modules are specifically tailored by taking into account unique channel characteristics. Simulations validate that the proposed method achieves SOTA prediction performance on full-sample, few-shot, and generalization tests with low training and inference costs.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based methods have recently demonstrated their potential in time series forecasting problems. However, the mainstream approach, primarily utilizing attention to model inter-step correlation in the time domain, is constrained by two significant issues that lead to ineffective and inefficient multivariate forecasting. The first is that key representations in the time domain are scattered and sparse, resulting in parameter bloat and increased difficulty in capturing time dependencies. The second is that treating time step points as uniformly embedded tokens leads to the erasure of inter-variate correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a frequency-wise and variables-oriented transformer-based method. This method leverages the intrinsic conjugate symmetry in the frequency domain, enabling compact frequency domain representations that naturally mix information across time points while reducing spatio-temporal costs. Multivariate inter-correlations can also be captured from similar frequency domain components, which enhances the variables-oriented attention mechanism modeling capability. Further, we employ both polar and complex domain perspectives to enrich the frequency domain representations and decode complicated temporal patterns. We propose frequency-enhanced independent representation multi-head attention (FIR-Attention) to leverage these advantages for improved multivariate interaction. Techniques such as cutting-off frequency and equivalent mapping are used to ensure the model’s lightweight nature. Extensive experiments on eight mainstream datasets show that our approach achieves first-rate satisfactory results and, importantly, requires only one percent of the spatio-temporal cost of mainstream methods.">

        <tr id="We introduce the Robustness of Hierarchically Organized Time Series (RHiOTS) framework, designed to assess the robustness of hierarchical time series forecasting models and algorithms on real-world datasets. Hierarchical time series, where lower-level forecasts must sum to upper-level ones, are prevalent in various contexts, such as retail sales across countries. Current empirical evaluations of forecasting methods are often limited to a small set of benchmark datasets, offering a narrow view of algorithm behavior. RHiOTS addresses this gap by systematically altering existing datasets and modifying the characteristics of individual series and their interrelations. It uses a set of parameterizable transformations to simulate those changes in the data distribution. Additionally, RHiOTS incorporates an innovative visualization component, turning complex, multidimensional robustness evaluation results into intuitive, easily interpretable visuals. This approach allows an in-depth analysis of algorithm and model behavior under diverse conditions. We illustrate the use of RHiOTS by analyzing the predictive performance of several algorithms. Our findings show that traditional statistical methods are more robust than state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, except when the transformation effect is highly disruptive. Furthermore, we found no significant differences in the robustness of the algorithms when applying specific reconciliation methods, such as MinT. RHiOTS provides researchers with a comprehensive tool for understanding the nuanced behavior of forecasting algorithms, offering a more reliable basis for selecting the most appropriate method for a given problem.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces scour physics-informed neural networks (SPINNs), a hybrid physics-data-driven framework for bridge scour prediction using deep learning. SPINNs are developed based on historical scour monitoring data and integrate physics-based empirical equations into neural networks as supplementary loss components. We incorporated three architectures: LSTM, CNN, and NLinear as the base data-driven model. Despite varying performance across different base models and bridges, SPINNs overall outperformed pure data-driven models. In some bridge cases, SPINN reduced forecasting errors by up to 50 percent. In this study, we also explored general models for bridge clusters, trained by aggregating datasets across multiple bridges in a region. The pure data-driven models mostly benefited from this approach, in particular bridges with limited data. However, bridge-specific SPINNs provided more accurate predictions than general SPINNs for almost all case studies. Also, the time-dependent empirical equations derived from SPINNs showed reasonable accuracy in estimating maximum scour depth, providing more accurate predictions compared to HEC-18. Comparing both SPINNs and pure deep learning models with traditional HEC-18 equation indicates substantial improvements in scour prediction accuracy. This study can pave the way for hybrid physics-machine learning methodologies to be implemented for bridge scour design and maintenance.">

        <tr id="Forecasting multivariate time series is a computationally intensive task challenged by extreme or redundant samples. Recent resampling methods aim to increase training efficiency by reweighting samples based on their running losses. However, these methods do not solve the problems caused by heavy-tailed distribution losses, such as overfitting to outliers. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel approach: a Gaussian loss-weighted sampler that multiplies their running losses with a Gaussian distribution weight. It reduces the probability of selecting samples with very low or very high losses while favoring those close to average losses. As it creates a weighted loss distribution that is not heavy-tailed theoretically, there are several advantages to highlight compared to existing methods: 1) it relieves the inefficiency in learning redundant easy samples and overfitting to outliers, 2) It improves training efficiency by preferentially learning samples close to the average loss. Application on real-world time series forecasting datasets demonstrate improvements in prediction quality for 1%-4% using mean square error measurements in channel-independent settings.

 Transformer models have recently become very successful in the natural language domain. Their value as sequence-to-sequence translators there, also makes them a highly interesting technique for learning relationships between astrophysical time series. Our aim is investigate how well such a transformer neural network can establish causal temporal relations between different channels of a single-source signal. We thus apply a transformer model to the two phases of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), reconstructing one phase from the other. GRBs are unique instances where a single process and event produces two distinct time variable phenomena: the prompt emission and the afterglow. We here investigate if a transformer model can predict the afterglow flux from the prompt emission. If successful, such a predictive scheme might then be distilled to the most important underlying physics drivers in the future. We combine the transformer model with a novel dense neural network setup to directly estimate the starting value of the prediction. We find that the transformer model can, in some instances, successfully predict different phases of canonical afterglows, including the plateau phase. Hence it is a useful and promising new astrophysical analysis technique. For the GRB test case, the method marginally exceeds the baseline model overall, but still achieves accurate recovery of the prompt-afterglow fluence-fluence correlation in reconstructed light curves. Despite this progress, we conclude that consistent improvement over the baseline model is not yet achieved for the GRB case. We discuss the future improvements in data and modeling that are required to identify new physical-relation parameters or new insights into the single process driving both GRB phases.">

        <tr id="We study an emerging and intriguing problem of multimodal temporal event forecasting with large language models. Compared to using text or graph modalities, the investigation of utilizing images for temporal event forecasting has not been fully explored, especially in the era of large language models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we are particularly interested in two key questions of: 1) why images will help in temporal event forecasting, and 2) how to integrate images into the LLM-based forecasting framework. To answer these research questions, we propose to identify two essential functions that images play in the scenario of temporal event forecasting, i.e., highlighting and complementary. Then, we develop a novel framework, named MM-Forecast. It employs an Image Function Identification module to recognize these functions as verbal descriptions using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and subsequently incorporates these function descriptions into LLM-based forecasting models. To evaluate our approach, we construct a new multimodal dataset, MidEast-TE-mm, by extending an existing event dataset MidEast-TE-mini with images. Empirical studies demonstrate that our MM-Forecast can correctly identify the image functions, and further more, incorporating these verbal function descriptions significantly improves the forecasting performance.

We derive a closed-form solution for multi-task optimization in the context of linear models. Our analysis provides valuable insights by linking the multi-task learning performance to various model statistics such as raw data covariances, signal-generating hyperplanes, noise levels, as well as the size and number of datasets. We finally propose a consistent estimation of training and testing errors, thereby offering a robust foundation for hyperparameter optimization in multi-task regression scenarios.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has been an essential field in many different application areas, including economic analysis, meteorology, and so forth. The majority of time series forecasting models are trained using the mean squared error (MSE). However, this training based on MSE causes a limitation known as prediction delay. The prediction delay, which implies the ground-truth precedes the prediction, can cause serious problems in a variety of fields, e.g., finance and weather forecasting -- as a matter of fact, predictions succeeding ground-truth observations are not practically meaningful although their MSEs can be low. This paper proposes a new perspective on traditional time series forecasting tasks and introduces a new solution to mitigate the prediction delay. We introduce a continuous-time gated recurrent unit (GRU) based on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) which can supervise explicit time-derivatives. We generalize the GRU architecture in a continuous-time manner and minimize the prediction delay through our time-derivative regularization. Our method outperforms in metrics such as MSE, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Time Distortion Index (TDI). In addition, we demonstrate the low prediction delay of our method in a variety of datasets.">

        <tr id="Self-supervised contrastive learning has become a key technique in deep learning, particularly in time series analysis, due to its ability to learn meaningful representations without explicit supervision. Augmentation is a critical component in contrastive learning, where different augmentations can dramatically impact performance, sometimes influencing accuracy by over 30%. However, the selection of augmentations is predominantly empirical which can be suboptimal, or grid searching that is time-consuming. In this paper, we establish a principled framework for selecting augmentations based on dataset characteristics such as trend and seasonality. Specifically, we construct 12 synthetic datasets incorporating trend, seasonality, and integration weights. We then evaluate the effectiveness of 8 different augmentations across these synthetic datasets, thereby inducing generalizable associations between time series characteristics and augmentation efficiency. Additionally, we evaluated the induced associations across 6 real-world datasets encompassing domains such as activity recognition, disease diagnosis, traffic monitoring, electricity usage, mechanical fault prognosis, and finance. These real-world datasets are diverse, covering a range from 1 to 12 channels, 2 to 10 classes, sequence lengths of 14 to 1280, and data frequencies from 250 Hz to daily intervals. The experimental results show that our proposed trend-seasonality-based augmentation recommendation algorithm can accurately identify the effective augmentations for a given time series dataset, achieving an average Recall@3 of 0.667, outperforming baselines. Our work provides guidance for studies employing contrastive learning in time series analysis, with wide-ranging applications.

Moreover, the decoder recurrence allows generation to be resumed without reprocessing the whole sequence. Finally, we propose the autoregressive VSSM that can be conditioned on a partial realization of the sequence, as is common in language generation tasks. Interestingly, the autoregressive VSSM still enables parallel generation.

In this paper, we challenge traditional approaches by introducing a novel benchmark, HoTPP, specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to predict event sequences over a horizon. This benchmark features a new metric inspired by object detection in computer vision, addressing the limitations of existing metrics in assessing models with imprecise time-step predictions. Our evaluations on established datasets employing various models demonstrate that high accuracy in next-event prediction does not necessarily translate to superior horizon prediction, and vice versa. HoTPP aims to serve as a valuable tool for developing more robust event sequence prediction methods, ultimately paving the way for further advancements in the field.">

        <tr id="Real-time lightweight time series anomaly detection has become increasingly crucial in cybersecurity and many other domains. Its ability to adapt to unforeseen pattern changes and swiftly identify anomalies enables prompt responses and critical decision-making. While several such anomaly detection approaches have been introduced in recent years, they primarily utilize a single type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and have been implemented in only one deep learning framework. It is unclear how the use of different types of RNNs available in various deep learning frameworks affects the performance of these anomaly detection approaches due to the absence of comprehensive evaluations. Arbitrarily choosing a RNN variant and a deep learning framework to implement an anomaly detection approach may not reflect its true performance and could potentially mislead users into favoring one approach over another. In this paper, we aim to study the influence of various types of RNNs available in popular deep learning frameworks on real-time lightweight time series anomaly detection. We reviewed several state-of-the-art approaches and implemented a representative anomaly detection approach using well-known RNN variants supported by three widely recognized deep learning frameworks. A comprehensive evaluation is then conducted to analyze the performance of each implementation across real-world, open-source time series datasets. The evaluation results provide valuable guidance for selecting the appropriate RNN variant and deep learning framework for real-time, lightweight time series anomaly detection.">

Recently deep learning models have shown great advances in modeling the time series data but they heavily depend on a large amount of labeled data. To avoid costly labeling, this paper explores domain adaptation from a labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain on time series data. To achieve the goal, we propose a disentangled representation learning framework named CADT to disentangle the domain-invariant features from the domain-specific ones. Particularly, CADT is injected with a novel class-wise hypersphere loss to improve the generalization of the classifier from the source domain to the target domain. Intuitively, it restricts the source data of the same class within the same hypersphere and minimizes the radius of it, which in turn enlarges the margin between different classes and makes the decision boundary of both domains easier. We further devise several kinds of domain-preserving data augmentation methods to better capture the domain-specific patterns. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and two real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model against several state-of-the-art baselines.">

        <tr id="Point forecasting in univariate random walks is an important but challenging research topic that has attracted numerous researchers. Unfortunately, traditional regression methods for this task often fail to surpass naive benchmarks due to data unpredictability. From a decision fusion perspective, this study proposes a novel forecasting method, which is derived from a variant definition of random walks, where the random error term for the future value is expressed as a positive random error multiplied by a direction sign. This method, based on the fusion of movement and naive predictions, does not require a loss function for optimization and can be optimized by estimating movement prediction accuracy on the validation set. This characteristic prevents the fusion method from reverting to traditional regression methods and allows it to integrate various machine learning and deep learning models for movement prediction. The method's efficacy is demonstrated through simulations and real-world data experiments. It reliably outperforms naive forecasts with moderate movement prediction accuracies, such as 0.55, and is superior to baseline models such as the ARIMA, linear regression, MLP, and LSTM networks in forecasting the S&P 500 index and Bitcoin prices. This method is particularly advantageous when accurate point predictions are challenging but accurate movement predictions are attainable, translating movement predictions into point forecasts in random walk contexts.">

        <tr id="The goal of stock trend prediction is to forecast future market movements for informed investment decisions. Existing methods mostly focus on predicting stock trends with supervised models trained on extensive annotated data. However, human annotation can be resource-intensive and the annotated data are not readily available. Inspired by the impressive few-shot capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose using LLMs in a few-shot setting to overcome the scarcity of labeled data and make prediction more feasible to investors. Previous works typically merge multiple financial news for predicting stock trends, causing two significant problems when using LLMs: (1) Merged news contains noise, and (2) it may exceed LLMs' input limits, leading to performance degradation. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-step method 'denoising-then-voting'. Specifically, we introduce an `Irrelevant' category, and predict stock trends for individual news instead of merged news. Then we aggregate these predictions using majority voting. The proposed method offers two advantages: (1) Classifying noisy news as irrelevant removes its impact on the final prediction. (2) Predicting for individual news mitigates LLMs' input length limits. Our method achieves 66.59% accuracy in S&P 500, 62.17% in CSI-100, and 61.17% in HK stock prediction, outperforming the standard few-shot counterparts by around 7%, 4%, and 4%. Furthermore, our proposed method performs on par with state-of-the-art supervised methods.">

However, they still suffer from limitations of the autoregressive training paradigm. For example, autoregressive token generation is notably slow and can be prone to \textit{exposure bias}. The diffusion-based language models were proposed as an alternative to autoregressive generation to address some of these limitations. We evaluate the recently proposed Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion (SEDD) approach and show it is a promising alternative to autoregressive generation but it has some short-comings too. We empirically demonstrate the advantages and challenges of SEDD, and observe that SEDD generally matches autoregressive models in perplexity and on benchmarks such as HellaSwag, Arc or WinoGrande. Additionally, we show that in terms of inference latency, SEDD can be up to 4.5$\times$ more efficient than GPT-2. While SEDD allows conditioning on tokens at abitrary positions, SEDD appears slightly weaker than GPT-2 for conditional generation given short prompts. Finally, we reproduced the main results from the original SEDD paper.">

It is crucial to understand it for the development of techniques focusing on attention distribution, such as Key-Value (KV) Cache compression and infinite extrapolation; however, the latent cause leaves to be unknown. In this paper, we analyze such a phenomenon from the perspective of waiver phenomenon, which involves reducing the internal values of certain elements in the sequence, allowing them to absorb excess attention without affecting their contribution to information. In specific models, due to differences in positional encoding and attention patterns, we have found that the selection of waiver elements by the model can be categorized into two methods: positional-encoding-based and feature-distribution-within-elements-based.">

 Traffic forecasting problems involve jointly modeling the non-linear spatio-temporal dependencies at different scales. While Graph Neural Network models have been effectively used to capture the non-linear spatial dependencies, capturing the dynamic spatial dependencies between the locations remains a major challenge. The errors in capturing such dependencies propagate in modeling the temporal dependencies between the locations, thereby severely affecting the performance of long-term predictions. While transformer-based mechanisms have been recently proposed for capturing the dynamic spatial dependencies, these methods are susceptible to fluctuations in data brought on by unforeseen events like traffic congestion and accidents. To mitigate these issues we propose an improvised Spatio-temporal parallel transformer (STPT) based model for traffic prediction that uses multiple adjacency graphs passed through a pair of coupled graph transformer-convolution network units, operating in parallel, to generate more noise-resilient embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 real-world traffic datasets and compare the performance of STPT with several state-of-the-art baselines, in terms of measures like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. We find that using STPT improves the performance by around

 \(10-34\%\)

 as compared to the baselines. We also investigate the applicability of the model on other spatio-temporal data in other domains. We use a covid-19 dataset to predict the number of future occurrences in different regions from a given set of historical occurrences. The results demonstrate the superiority of our model for such datasets.

A common STLF approach involves making predictions based on multiple input variables which affect the load. However, additional data besides historical load data often are not available, making STLF a challenging univariate task. Two approaches are discussed in this paper for the univariate day-ahead STLF: the first integrates temporal information into the input regression vector, with Seasonal Auto-Regressive Moving Average (SARMA) and Prophet being the best representatives for the application considered; the second integrates temporal information directly into its architecture through the feedback of the internal state, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) chosen for this purpose. The models were evaluated on a real case study involving a university building in Italy. The results validate the effectiveness of the LSTM model. LSTM performed significantly better than SARIMA, and slightly better than RNN and Prophet, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) equal to 13.12 kW, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) equal to 25.09 kW, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) equal to 10.97% and an R2 score equal to 0.85. This work provides a foundation for the improvement and deployment of such time series forecasting techniques in the emerging field of STLF for energy management.">

We call this benchmark Seq-to-Final to highlight the focus on using a sequence of time periods to learn a model for the final time point. Our synthetic benchmark allows users to construct sequences with different types of shift and compare different methods. We focus on image classification tasks using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as the base images for the synthetic sequences. We also evaluate the same methods on the Portraits dataset to explore the relevance to real-world shifts over time. Finally, we create a visualization to contrast the initializations and updates from different methods at the final time step. Our results suggest that, for the sequences in our benchmark, methods that disregard the sequential structure and adapt to the final time point tend to perform well. The approaches we evaluate that leverage the sequential nature do not offer any improvement. We hope that this benchmark will inspire the development of new algorithms that are better at leveraging sequential historical data or a deeper understanding of why methods that disregard the sequential nature are able to perform well.">

This approach allows us to model different temporal components individually. By applying specific conformal algorithms to each component and then merging the obtained prediction intervals, we customize our methods to account for the different exchangeability regimes underlying each component. Our decomposition-based approach is thoroughly discussed and empirically evaluated on synthetic and real-world data.

        <tr id="Multivariate time series modeling has been essential in sensor-based data mining tasks. However, capturing complex dynamics caused by intra-variable (temporal) and inter-variable (spatial) relationships while simultaneously taking into account evolving data distributions is a non-trivial task, which faces accumulated computational overhead and multiple temporal patterns or distribution modes. Most existing methods focus on the former direction without adaptive task-specific learning ability. To this end, we developed a holistic spatial-temporal meta-learning probabilistic inference framework, entitled ST-MeLaPI, for the efficient and versatile learning of complex dynamics. Specifically, first, a multivariate relationship recognition module is utilized to learn task-specific inter-variable dependencies. Then, a multiview meta-learning and probabilistic inference strategy was designed to learn shared parameters while enabling the fast and flexible learning of task-specific parameters for different batches. At the core are spatial dependency-oriented and temporal pattern-oriented meta-learning approximate probabilistic inference modules, which can quickly adapt to changing environments via stochastic neurons at each timestamp. Finally, a gated aggregation scheme is leveraged to realize appropriate information selection for the generative style prediction. We benchmarked our approach against state-of-the-art methods with real-world data. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the baselines.">

        <tr id="The telecommunications industry is becoming increasingly aware of potential subscriber churn as a result of the growing popularity of smartphones in the mobile Internet era, the quick development of telecommunications services, the implementation of the number portability policy, and the intensifying competition among operators. At the same time, users' consumption preferences and choices are evolving. Excellent churn prediction models must be created in order to accurately predict the churn tendency, since keeping existing customers is far less expensive than acquiring new ones. But conventional or learning-based algorithms can only go so far into a single subscriber's data; they cannot take into consideration changes in a subscriber's subscription and ignore the coupling and correlation between various features. Additionally, the current churn prediction models have a high computational burden, a fuzzy weight distribution, and significant resource economic costs. The prediction algorithms involving network models currently in use primarily take into account the private information shared between users with text and pictures, ignoring the reference value supplied by other users with the same package. This work suggests a user churn prediction model based on Graph Attention Convolutional Neural Network (GAT-CNN) to address the aforementioned issues. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, we present a three-tiered hierarchical cloud-edge cooperative framework that increases the volume of user feature input by means of two aggregations at the device, edge, and cloud layers. Second, we extend the use of users' own data by introducing self-attention and graph convolution models to track the relative changes of both users and packages simultaneously. Lastly, we build an integrated offline-online system for churn prediction based on the strengths of the two models, and we experimentally validate the efficacy of cloud-side collaborative training and inference. In summary, the churn prediction model based on Graph Attention Convolutional Neural Network presented in this paper can effectively address the drawbacks of conventional algorithms and offer telecom operators crucial decision support in developing subscriber retention strategies and cutting operational expenses.">

Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modeling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missingness ratios and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

        <tr id="Recently, the incorporation of both temporal features and the correlation across time series has become an effective approach in time series prediction. Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) demonstrate good performance on many Temporal-correlation Forecasting Problem. However, when applied to tasks lacking periodicity, such as stock data prediction, the effectiveness and robustness of STGNNs are found to be unsatisfactory. And STGNNs are limited by memory savings so that cannot handle problems with a large number of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network (TCGPN) to address these limitations. TCGPN utilize Temporal-correlation fusion encoder to get a mixed representation and pre-training method with carefully designed temporal and correlation pre-training tasks. Entire structure is independent of the number and order of nodes, so better results can be obtained through various data enhancements. And memory consumption during training can be significantly reduced through multiple sampling. Experiments are conducted on real stock market data sets CSI300 and CSI500 that exhibit minimal periodicity. We fine-tune a simple MLP in downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results, validating the capability to capture more robust temporal correlation patterns.">

        <tr id="We present a knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) framework for modeling multi-scale processes, and study its performance in the context of streamflow forecasting in hydrology. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical recurrent neural architecture that factorizes the system dynamics at multiple temporal scales and captures their interactions. This framework consists of an inverse and a forward model. The inverse model is used to empirically resolve the system's temporal modes from data (physical model simulations, observed data, or a combination of them from the past), and these states are then used in the forward model to predict streamflow. In a hydrological system, these modes can represent different processes, evolving at different temporal scales (e.g., slow: groundwater recharge and baseflow vs. fast: surface runoff due to extreme rainfall). A key advantage of our framework is that once trained, it can incorporate new observations into the model's context (internal state) without expensive optimization approaches (e.g., EnKF) that are traditionally used in physical sciences for data assimilation. Experiments with several river catchments from the NWS NCRFC region show the efficacy of this ML-based data assimilation framework compared to standard baselines, especially for basins that have a long history of observations. Even for basins that have a shorter observation history, we present two orthogonal strategies of training our FHNN framework: (a) using simulation data from imperfect simulations and (b) using observation data from multiple basins to build a global model. We show that both of these strategies (that can be used individually or together) are highly effective in mitigating the lack of training data. The improvement in forecast accuracy is particularly noteworthy for basins where local models perform poorly because of data sparsity.">

        <tr id="This study proposes a novel hybrid model, called ICE2DE-MDL, integrating secondary decomposition, entropy, machine and deep learning methods to predict a stock closing price. In this context, first of all, the noise contained in the financial time series was eliminated. A denoising method, which utilizes entropy and the two-level ICEEMDAN methodology, is suggested to achieve this. Subsequently, we applied many deep learning and machine learning methods, including long-short term memory (LSTM), LSTM-BN, gated recurrent unit (GRU), and SVR, to the IMFs obtained from the decomposition, classifying them as noiseless. Afterward, the best training method was determined for each IMF. Finally, the proposed model’s forecast was obtained by hierarchically combining the prediction results of each IMF. The ICE2DE-MDL model was applied to eight stock market indices and three stock data sets, and the next day’s closing price of these stock items was predicted. The results indicate that RMSE values ranged from 0.031 to 0.244, MAE values ranged from 0.026 to 0.144, MAPE values ranged from 0.128 to 0.594, and R-squared values ranged from 0.905 to 0.998 for stock indices and stock forecasts. Furthermore, comparisons were made with various hybrid models proposed within the scope of stock forecasting to evaluate the performance of the ICE2DE-MDL model. Upon comparison, The ICE2DE-MDL model demonstrated superior performance relative to existing models in the literature for both forecasting stock market indices and individual stocks. Additionally, to our knowledge, this study is the first to effectively eliminate noise in stock item data using the concepts of entropy and ICEEMDAN. It is also the second study to apply ICEEMDAN to a financial time series prediction problem.">

We investigate the use of neural networks for lifelong graph summarization. Assuming we observe the web graph at a certain time, we train the networks to summarize graph vertices. We apply this trained network to summarize the vertices of the changed graph at the next point in time. Subsequently, we continue training and evaluating the network to perform lifelong graph summarization. We use the GNNs Graph-MLP and GraphSAINT, as well as an MLP baseline, to summarize the temporal graphs. We compare $1$-hop and $2$-hop summaries. We investigate the impact of reusing parameters from a previous snapshot by measuring the backward and forward transfer and the forgetting rate of the neural networks. Our extensive experiments on ten weekly snapshots of a web graph with over $100$M edges, sampled in 2012 and 2022, show that all networks predominantly use $1$-hop information to determine the summary, even when performing $2$-hop summarization. Due to the heterogeneity of web graphs, in some snapshots, the $2$-hop summary produces over ten times more vertex summaries than the $1$-hop summary. When using the network trained on the last snapshot from 2012 and applying it to the first snapshot of 2022, we observe a strong drop in accuracy. We attribute this drop over the ten-year time warp to the strongly increased heterogeneity of the web graph in 2022.">

        <tr id="This study introduces a novel approach that integrates dynamic Bayesian network with attention based spatio-temporal graph convolutional network to forecast railway train delays, capturing the intricate operation interactions between train events and the dynamic evolution of train delays. Initially, train delay patterns are identified using the K-means clustering algorithm and incorporated as additional variables into the prediction model. To capture dynamic causality in delay propagation, we utilize a dynamic Bayesian network-based dynamic causality graph, incorporating train delay data and domain knowledge to effectively model the train delay propagation. Leveraging these insights on delay dynamic propagation, we propose an attention based spatio-temporal graph convolutional network that effectively models the dynamic spatio-temporal dependency among train events and enhances the accuracy of delay predictions. The proposed method is assessed using operational data from the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway. Results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models, particularly with the expansion of the prediction horizon. The learned dynamic causality of the train delay propagation enhances interpretability and results in a 6.97% reduction in mean absolute error. Furthermore, train delay patterns and weather variables contribute to a respective 12.85% and 4.37% reduction in mean absolute error. The statistical tests further validate the efficacy of the proposed model.">

        <tr id="Dynamic graphs (DG) are often used to describe evolving interactions between nodes in real-world applications. Temporal patterns are a natural feature of DGs and are also key to representation learning. However, existing dynamic GCN models are mostly composed of static GCNs and sequence modules, which results in the separation of spatiotemporal information and cannot effectively capture complex temporal patterns in DGs. To address this problem, this study proposes a spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks with diversified transformation (STGCNDT), which includes three aspects: a) constructing a unified graph tensor convolutional network (GTCN) using tensor M-products without the need to represent spatiotemporal information separately; b) introducing three transformation schemes in GTCN to model complex temporal patterns to aggregate temporal information; and c) constructing an ensemble of diversified transformation schemes to obtain higher representation capabilities. Empirical studies on four DGs that appear in communication networks show that the proposed STGCNDT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in solving link weight estimation tasks due to the diversified transformations.">

Owing to the complexity of port systems, traditional load forecasting methods often struggle to capture the non-linearity and multifactorial interactions within the factors creating power load. To address these challenges, this study combines variational mode decomposition (VMD), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) network to develop a multi-feature-based VMD-TCN-LSTM model for the short-term forecasting of the power load of ports. VMD is first used to decompose the power load series of ports into multiple, relatively stable components to mitigate volatility. Furthermore, meteorological and temporal features are introduced into the TCN-LSTM model, which combines the temporal feature extraction capability of the TCN and the long term-dependent learning capability of the LSTM. Comparative analyses with other common forecasting models using the observed power load data from a coastal port in China demonstrate that the proposed forecasting model achieves a higher prediction accuracy, with an R-squared value of 0.94, mean squared error of 3.59 MW, and a mean absolute percentage error of 2.36%.">

Recently, deep learning-based methods have been increasingly applied in the field of weather forecasting due to their powerful feature learning capabilities. However, prediction methods based on the original space iteration struggle to effectively and efficiently utilize large number of weather variables. Therefore, we propose an 'encoding-prediction-decoding' prediction network. This network can efficiently benefit to more related input variables with key variables, that is, it can adaptively extract key variable-related low-dimensional latent feature from much more input atmospheric variables for iterative prediction. And we construct a loss function to guide the iteration of latent feature by utilizing multiple atmospheric variables in corresponding lead times. The obtained latent features through iterative prediction are then decoded to obtain the predicted values of key variables in multiple lead times. In addition, we improve the HTA algorithm in \cite{bi2023accurate} by inputting more time steps to enhance the temporal correlation between the prediction results and input variables. Both qualitative and quantitative prediction results on ERA5 dataset validate the superiority of our method over other methods. (The code will be available at https://github.com/rs-lsl/Kvp-lsi)">

Our approach is shown to combine the strengths of next-token prediction models, such as variable-length generation, with the strengths of full-sequence diffusion models, such as the ability to guide sampling to desirable trajectories. Our method offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out sequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training horizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that uniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing's variable-horizon and causal architecture, and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and planning tasks. In addition to its empirical success, our method is proven to optimize a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of tokens drawn from the true joint distribution.

Adapting the model can hopefully mitigate this drop in performance. Yet, adaptation is challenging since it must be unsupervised: we usually do not have access to any labeled data at test time. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic state-space model that can adapt a deployed model subjected to distribution drift. Our model learns the dynamics induced by distribution shifts on the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, we infer time-evolving class prototypes that serve as a dynamic classification head. Moreover, our approach is lightweight, modifying only the model's last linear layer. In experiments on real-world distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions, we demonstrate that our approach performs competitively with methods that require back-propagation and access to the model backbone. Our model especially excels in the case of small test batches - the most difficult setting.">

This obstacle necessitates a pivot towards unsupervised representation learning methodologies, which do not require many labeled datasets. The existing research focused on the tradeoff between the fully supervised model and the unsupervised pre-trained model and found that the unsupervised version outperformed in most cases. However, their investigation did not use large enough Human Activity Recognition (HAR) datasets, both datasets resulting in 3 dimensions. This poster extends the investigation by employing a large multivariate time series HAR dataset and experimenting with the models with different combinations of critical training parameters such as batch size and learning rate to observe the performance tradeoff. Our findings reveal that the pre-trained model is comparable to the fully supervised classification with a larger multivariate time series HAR dataset. This discovery underscores the potential of unsupervised representation learning in ADL extractions and highlights the importance of model configuration in optimizing performance.">

However, most existing methods struggle to address complex spatial correlations on road networks, nonlinear temporal dynamics, and difficult long‐term prediction. This article proposes a novel spatial temporal graph gated transformer (STGGT) to overcome these challenges. The suggested model differs from Google's transformer because it uses a hybrid architecture that integrates graph convolutional networks (GCNs), attention, and gated recurrent units (GRUs) instead of solely relying on attention. Specifically, STGGT uses GCNs to extract spatial dependencies, utilizes attention and GRUs to extract temporal dependencies, and handle long‐term prediction. Experiments indicate that STGGT outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art baseline models on two real‐world traffic datasets of 9%–40%. The proposed model offers a promising solution for accurate traffic forecasting, simultaneously addressing the challenges of complex spatial correlations, nonlinear temporal dynamics, and long‐term prediction.">

        <tr id="Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a crucial data mining technique with a wide range of applications in areas such as IT applications. Currently, the majority of anomaly detection methods for time series data rely on unsupervised approaches due to the rarity of anomaly labels. However, in real-world scenarios, obtaining a limited number of anomaly labels is feasible and affordable. Effective usage of these labels can offer valuable insights into the temporal characteristics of anomalies and play a pivotal role in guiding anomaly detection efforts. To improve the performance of multivariate time series anomaly detection, we proposed a novel deep learning model named EDD (Encoder-Decoder-Discriminator) that leverages limited anomaly samples. The EDD model innovatively integrates a graph attention network with long short term memory (LSTM) to extract spatial and temporal features from multivariate time series data. This integrated approach enables the model to capture complex patterns and dependencies within the data. Additionally, the model skillfully maps series data into a latent space, utilizing a carefully crafted loss function to cluster normal data tightly in the latent space while dispersing abnormal data randomly. This innovative design results in distinct probability distributions for normal and abnormal data in the latent space, enabling precise identification of anomalous data. To evaluate the performance of our EDD model, we conducted extensive experimental validation across three diverse datasets. The results demonstrate the significant superiority of our model in multivariate time series anomaly detection. Specifically, the average F1-Score of our model outperformed the second-best method by 2.7% and 73.4% in both evaluation approaches, respectively, highlighting its superior detection capabilities. These findings validate the effectiveness of our proposed EDD model in leveraging limited anomaly samples for accurate and robust anomaly detection in multivariate time series data.">

Our experiments reveal that hidden states of motion sequences are arranged with respect to our discrete sets of motion features.

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for supervised machine learning over graph-structured data, while sampling-based node representation learning is widely utilized in unsupervised learning. However, scalability remains a major challenge in both supervised and unsupervised learning for large graphs (e.g., those with over 1 billion nodes). The scalability bottleneck largely stems from the mini-batch sampling phase in GNNs and the random walk sampling phase in unsupervised methods. These processes often require storing features or embeddings in memory. In the context of distributed training, they require frequent, inefficient random access to data stored across different workers. Such repeated inter-worker communication for each mini-batch leads to high communication overhead and computational inefficiency. We propose GraphScale, a unified framework for both supervised and unsupervised learning to store and process large graph data distributedly. The key insight in our design is the separation of workers who store data and those who perform the training. This separation allows us to decouple computing and storage in graph training, thus effectively building a pipeline where data fetching and data computation can overlap asynchronously. Our experiments show that GraphScale outperforms state-of-the-art methods for distributed training of both GNNs and node embeddings. We evaluate GraphScale both on public and proprietary graph datasets and observe a reduction of at least 40% in end-to-end training times compared to popular distributed frameworks, without any loss in performance. While most existing methods don't support billion-node graphs for training node embeddings, GraphScale is currently deployed in production at TikTok enabling efficient learning over such large graphs.">

However, there are some challenges for time-series forecasting in industry, e.g., predicting few-shot caused by data shortage, and decision-confusing caused by unknown treatment policy. To cope with the problems, we propose a novel causal domain adaptation framework, Causal Domain Adaptation (CDA) forecaster to improve the performance on the interested domain with limited data (target). Firstly, we analyze the causality existing along with treatments, and thus ensure the shared causality over time. Subsequently, we propose an answer-based attention mechanism to achieve domain-invariant representation by the shared causality in both domains. Then, a novel domain-adaptation is built to model treatments and outcomes jointly training on source and target domain. The main insights are that our designed answer-based attention mechanism allows the target domain to leverage the existed causality in source time-series even with different treatments, and our forecaster can predict the counterfactual outcome of industrial time-series, meaning a guidance in production process. Compared with commonly baselines, our method on real-world and synthetic oilfield datasets demonstrates the effectiveness in across-domain prediction and the practicality in guiding production process">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting (TSF) is immensely important in extensive applications, such as electricity transformation, financial trade, medical monitoring, and smart agriculture. Although Transformer-based methods can handle time series data, their ability to predict long-term time series is limited due to the ``anti-order"nature of the self-attention mechanism. To address this problem, we focus on frequency domain to weaken the impact of order in TSF and propose the FreqBlock, where we first obtain frequency representations through the Frequency Transform Module. Subsequently, a newly designed Frequency Cross Attention is used to obtian enhanced frequency representations between the real and imaginary parts, thus establishing a link between the attention mechanism and the inherent Kramer-Kronig relations (KKRs). Our backbone network, FreqTSF, adopts a residual structure by concatenating multiple FreqBlocks to simulate KKRs in the frequency domain and avoid degradation problems. On a theoretical level, we demonstrate that the proposed two modules can significantly reduce the time and memory complexity from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ for each FreqBlock computation. Empirical studies on four benchmark datasets show that FreqTSF achieves an overall relative MSE reduction of 15\% and an overall relative MAE reduction of 11\% compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available soon.">

A model is considered to be under stress if it shows a negative behaviour, such as higher-than-usual errors or increased uncertainty. Understanding the factors that cause stress to forecasting models is important to improve their reliability, transparency, and utility. This paper addresses this problem by contributing with a novel framework called MAST (Meta-learning and data Augmentation for Stress Testing). The proposed approach aims to model and characterize stress in univariate time series forecasting models, focusing on conditions where they exhibit large errors. In particular, MAST is a meta-learning approach that predicts the probability that a given model will perform poorly on a given time series based on a set of statistical time series features. MAST also encompasses a novel data augmentation technique based on oversampling to improve the metadata concerning stress. We conducted experiments using three benchmark datasets that contain a total of 49.794 time series to validate the performance of MAST. The results suggest that the proposed approach is able to identify conditions that lead to large errors. The method and experiments are publicly available in a repository.">

Traditional approaches primarily analyze specific structural features of the network; however, node influence is typically the result of a combination of multiple factors. Machine learning-based methods struggle to effectively represent the complex characteristics of network structures through suitable embedding techniques and require substantial data for training, rendering them prohibitively costly for large-scale networks. To address these challenges, this paper presents an active learning model based on GraphSAGE and Transformer, named GNNTAL. This model is initially pre-trained on random or synthetic networks and subsequently fine-tuned on real-world networks by selecting a few representative nodes using K-Means clustering and uncertainty sampling. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it significantly reduces training costs; (2) it simultaneously incorporates both local and global features. A series of comparative experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks demonstrate that GNNTAL achieves superior performance. Additionally, this paper proposes an influence maximization method based on the predictions of the GNNTAL model, which achieves optimal performance without the need for complex computations. Finally, the paper analyses certain limitations of the GNNTAL model and suggests potential solutions.">

This paper addresses them by introducing a deep sparse attention graph recurrent framework. This framework conceptualizes a set of neighboring residential units as a graph where the nodes are the net load values of the units and the edges show the mutual information (MI) of these measurements. We develop an Attention Gated Recurrent Unit (AGRU) to capture enhanced temporal characteristics of the net load. We employ a novel low-rank Dictionary Learning (DL) method to discern spatiotemporal features of these measurements and further utilize a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) neural network that incorporates an MI-based dropout to provide a sparse model for the estimation of the BTM load and PV. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, exhibiting superior performance on the Ausgrid dataset in BTM load and PV power estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods.">

        <tr id="The reward model has become increasingly important in alignment, assessment, and data construction for large language models (LLMs). Most existing researchers focus on enhancing reward models through data improvements, following the conventional training framework for reward models that directly optimizes the predicted rewards. In this paper, we propose a hybrid alignment framework HaF-RM for reward model training by introducing an additional constraint on token-level policy probabilities in addition to the reward score. It can simultaneously supervise the internal preference model at the token level and optimize the mapping layer of the reward model at the sequence level. Theoretical justifications and experiment results on five datasets show the validity and effectiveness of our proposed hybrid framework for training a high-quality reward model. By decoupling the reward modeling procedure and incorporating hybrid supervision, our HaF-RM framework offers a principled and effective approach to enhancing the performance and alignment of reward models, a critical component in the responsible development of powerful language models.

        <tr id="Time series analysis is pivotal for business and financial decision making, especially with the increasing integration of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, leveraging time series data for forecasting requires extensive preprocessing to address challenges such as missing values, heteroscedasticity, seasonality, outliers, and noise. Different approaches are necessary for univariate and multivariate time series, Gaussian and non-Gaussian time series, and stationary versus non-stationary time series. Handling missing data alone is complex, demanding unique solutions for each type. Extracting statistical features, identifying data quality issues, and selecting appropriate cleaning and forecasting techniques require significant effort, time, and expertise. To streamline this process, we propose an automated strategy called Preptimize, which integrates statistical and machine learning techniques and recommends prediction model blueprints, suggesting the most suitable approaches for a given dataset as an initial step towards further analysis. Preptimize reads a sample from a large dataset and recommends the blueprint model based on optimization, making it easy to use even for non-experts. The results of various experiments indicated that Preptimize either outperformed or had comparable performance to benchmark models across multiple sectors, including stock prices, cryptocurrency, and power consumption prediction. This demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness in recommending suitable prediction models for various time series datasets, highlighting its broad applicability across different domains in time series forecasting.">

        <tr id="Financial market simulation (FMS) serves as a promising tool for understanding market anomalies and the underlying trading behaviors. To ensure high-fidelity simulations, it is crucial to calibrate the FMS model for generating data closely resembling the observed market data. Previous efforts primarily focused on calibrating the mid-price data, leading to essential information loss of the market activities and thus biasing the calibrated model. The Limit Order Book (LOB) data is the fundamental data fully capturing the market micro-structure and is adopted by worldwide exchanges. However, LOB is not applicable to existing calibration objective functions due to its tabular structure not suitable for the vectorized input requirement. This paper proposes to explicitly learn the vectorized representations of LOB with a Transformer-based autoencoder. Then the latent vector, which captures the major information of LOB, can be applied for calibration. Extensive experiments show that the learned latent representation not only preserves the non-linear auto-correlation in the temporal axis, but the precedence between successive price levels of LOB. Besides, it is verified that the performance of the representation learning stage is consistent with the downstream calibration tasks. Thus, this work also progresses the FMS on LOB data, for the first time.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we apply a supervised machine-learning approach to solve a fundamental problem in queueing theory: estimating the transient distribution of the number in the system for a G(t)/GI/1. We develop a neural network mechanism that provides a fast and accurate predictor of these distributions for moderate horizon lengths and practical settings. It is based on using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture based on the first several moments of the time-dependant inter-arrival and the stationary service time distributions; we call it the Moment-Based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method (MBRNN ). Our empirical study suggests MBRNN requires only the first four inter-arrival and service time moments. We use simulation to generate a substantial training dataset and present a thorough performance evaluation to examine the accuracy of our method using two different test sets. We show that even under the configuration with the worst performance errors, the mean number of customers over the entire timeline has an error of less than 3%. While simulation modeling can achieve high accuracy, the advantage of the MBRNN over simulation is runtime, while the MBRNN analyzes hundreds of systems within a fraction of a second. This paper focuses on a G(t)/GI/1; however, the MBRNN approach demonstrated here can be extended to other queueing systems, as the training data labeling is based on simulations (which can be applied to more complex systems) and the training is based on deep learning, which can capture very complex time sequence tasks. In summary, the MBRNN can potentially revolutionize our ability to perform transient analyses of queueing systems.">

However, ahead of the war in Ukraine Europe began to suffer from substantially increased and volatile gas prices which culminated in the aftermath of the North Stream 1 explosion. This shock changed both trend and volatility structure of the prices and has considerable effects on forecasting models. In this study we investigate whether modern machine learning methods such as neural networks are more resilient against such changes than statistical models such as autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models with conditional heteroskedasticity, or copula-based time series models. Thereby the focus lies on interval forecasting and applying respective evaluation measures. As data, the Front Month prices from the Dutch Title Transfer Facility, currently the predominant European exchange, are used. We see that, during the shock period, most models underestimate the variance while overestimating the variance in the after-shock period. Furthermore, we recognize that, during the shock, the simpler models, i.e. an ARMA model with conditional heteroskedasticity and the multilayer perceptron (a neural network), perform best with regards to prediction interval coverage. Interestingly, the widely-used long-short term neural network is outperformed by its competitors.">

We employ a moving average model to model the variance of the noise input, enhancing the model's ability to reproduce stylized facts such as volatility clustering. Through empirical experiments on S&P 500 index data, we demonstrate that our model effectively captures key characteristics of financial time series and outperforms a comparable GAN-based approach. In addition, we explore the application of the synthetic data generated to train a reinforcement learning agent for portfolio management, achieving promising results. Finally, we propose a method to add robustness to the generative model by tweaking the noise input so that the generated sequences can be adjusted to different market environments with minimal data.">

We propose an uncertainty-aware buffering approach to identify and aggregate significant samples with high certainty from the unsupervised, single-pass data stream. Based on this, we propose a graph-based class relation preservation constraint to overcome catastrophic forgetting.

The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world.

In this study, we tackle this problem by applying the Quantum-Train (QT) technique to a forecasting Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model trained by Quantum Machine Learning (QML) with significant parameter reduction. The QT technique, originally successful in the A Matter of Taste challenge at QHack 2024, leverages QML to reduce the number of trainable parameters to a polylogarithmic function of the number of parameters in a classical neural network (NN). This innovative framework maps classical NN weights to a Hilbert space, altering quantum state probability distributions to adjust NN parameters. Our approach directly processes classical data without the need for quantum embedding and operates independently of quantum computing resources post-training, making it highly practical and accessible for real-world flood prediction applications.

        <tr id="The significance of modeling long-term user interests for CTR prediction tasks in large-scale recommendation systems is progressively gaining attention among researchers and practitioners. Existing work, such as SIM and TWIN, typically employs a two-stage approach to model long-term user behavior sequences for efficiency concerns. The first stage rapidly retrieves a subset of sequences related to the target item from a long sequence using a search-based mechanism namely the General Search Unit (GSU), while the second stage calculates the interest scores using the Exact Search Unit (ESU) on the retrieved results. Given the extensive length of user behavior sequences spanning the entire life cycle, potentially reaching up to 10^6 in scale, there is currently no effective solution for fully modeling such expansive user interests. To overcome this issue, we introduced TWIN-V2, an enhancement of TWIN, where a divide-and-conquer approach is applied to compress life-cycle behaviors and uncover more accurate and diverse user interests. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering method groups items with similar characteristics in life-cycle behaviors into a single cluster during the offline phase. By limiting the size of clusters, we can compress behavior sequences well beyond the magnitude of 10^5 to a length manageable for online inference in GSU retrieval. Cluster-aware target attention extracts comprehensive and multi-faceted long-term interests of users, thereby making the final recommendation results more accurate and diverse. Extensive offline experiments on a multi-billion-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests have demonstrated the effectiveness of TWIN-V2. Under an efficient deployment framework, TWIN-V2 has been successfully deployed to the primary traffic that serves hundreds of millions of daily active users at Kuaishou.">

 One of the core assumptions of most deep-learning-based data-driven models is that samples are independent. However, this assumption poses a key challenge in production forecasting—performance is influenced by well interference and reservoir connectivity. Most shale gas wells are hydraulically fractured and exist in complex fracture systems, and the neighboring well characteristics should also be considered when constructing data-driven forecast models. Researchers have explored using the graph convolutional network (GCN) to address this issue by incorporating neighboring well characteristics into production forecasting models. However, applying GCN to field-scale studies is problematic, as it requires training on a full batch, leading to gigantic cache allocation. In addition, the transductive nature of GCN poses challenges for direct generalization to unseen nodes. To overcome these limitations, we adopt the graph sampling and aggregation (GraphSAGE) network architecture, which allows training large graphs with batches and generalizing predictions for previously unseen nodes. By utilizing the gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, the proposed spatial-temporal (ST)-GraphSAGE model can capture cross-time relationships between the target and the neighboring wells and generate promising prediction time series for the target wells, even if they are newly drilled wells.
 The proposed approach is validated and tested using the field data from 2,240 Montney shale gas wells, including formation properties, hydraulic fracture parameters, production history, and operational data. The algorithm aggregates the first-hop information to the target node for each timestep. The encoder-decoder (ED) architecture is used to generate forecasts for the subsequent 3-year production rate by using the 1-year production history of the wells. The trained model enables the evaluation of production predictions for newly developed wells at any location. We evaluate the model’s performance using P10, P50, and P90 of the test data set’s root mean square error (RMSE). Our method preserves the topological characteristics of wells and generalizes the prediction to unseen nodes while significantly reducing training complexity, making it applicable to larger data sets. By incorporating information from adjacent wells and integrating ST data, our ST-GraphSAGE model outperforms the traditional GRU-ED model and shows enhanced interpretability.">

        <tr id="The advent of the"pre-train, prompt"paradigm has recently extended its generalization ability and data efficiency to graph representation learning, following its achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.">

However, provisioning zero-trust services in NGNs poses significant challenges, primarily due to the environmental complexity and dynamics. Motivated by these challenges, this paper explores efficient zero-trust service provisioning using hierarchical micro-segmentations. Specifically, we model zero-trust networks via hierarchical graphs, thereby jointly considering the resource- and trust-level features to optimize service efficiency. We organize such zero-trust networks through micro-segmentations, which support granular zero-trust policies efficiently. To generate the optimal micro-segmentation, we present the Large Language Model-Enhanced Graph Diffusion (LEGD) algorithm, which leverages the diffusion process to realize a high-quality generation paradigm. Additionally, we utilize policy boosting and Large Language Models (LLM) to enable LEGD to optimize the generation policy and understand complicated graphical features. Moreover, realizing the unique trustworthiness updates or service upgrades in zero-trust NGN, we further present LEGD-Adaptive Maintenance (LEGD-AM), providing an adaptive way to perform task-oriented fine-tuning on LEGD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LEGD achieves 90% higher efficiency in provisioning services compared with other baselines. Moreover, the LEGD-AM can reduce the service outage time by over 50%.">

The second step uses the elasticities derived from the previous step to interpolate unobserved high-frequency figures. We apply our method to nowcast countries' yearly research and development (R&D) expenditure series. These series are collected through infrequent surveys, making them ideal candidates for this task. We exploit a range of predictors, chiefly Internet search volume data, and document the relevance of these data in improving out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we leverage the high frequency of our data to derive monthly estimates of R&D expenditures, which are currently unobserved. We compare our results with those obtained from the classical regression-based and the sparse temporal disaggregation methods.

        <tr id="Despite recent advancements in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Time Series analysis, a noticeable gap persists between the anticipated achievements and actual performance. While these methods have demonstrated formidable generalization capabilities with minimal labels in various domains, their effectiveness in distinguishing between different classes based on a limited number of annotated records is notably lacking. Our hypothesis attributes this bottleneck to the prevalent use of Contrastive Learning, a shared training objective in previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. 

By mandating distinctiveness between representations for negative pairs drawn from separate records, this approach compels the model to encode unique record-based patterns but simultaneously neglects changes occurring across the entire record. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Distilled Embedding for Almost-Periodic Time Series (DEAPS) in this paper, offering a non-contrastive method tailored for quasiperiodic time series, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) data. By avoiding the use of negative pairs, we not only mitigate the model's blindness to temporal changes but also enable the integration of a "Gradual Loss (L_gra)" function. This function guides the model to effectively capture dynamic patterns evolving throughout the record. The outcomes are promising, as DEAPS demonstrates a notable improvement of +10% over existing SOTA methods when just a few annotated records are presented to fit a Machine Learning (ML) model based on the learned representation.">

        <tr id="Long-term time series forecasting is a long-standing challenge in various applications. A central issue in time series forecasting is that methods should expressively capture long-term dependency. Furthermore, time series forecasting methods should be flexible when applied to different scenarios. Although Fourier analysis offers an alternative to effectively capture reusable and periodic patterns to achieve long-term forecasting in different scenarios, existing methods often assume high-frequency components represent noise and should be discarded in time series forecasting. However, we conduct a series of motivation experiments and discover that the role of certain frequencies varies depending on the scenarios. In some scenarios, removing high-frequency components from the original time series can improve the forecasting performance, while in others scenarios, removing them is harmful to forecasting performance. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the frequencies differently according to specific scenarios. To achieve this, we first reformulate the time series forecasting problem as learning a transfer function of each frequency in the Fourier domain. Further, we design Frequency Dynamic Fusion (FreDF), which individually predicts each Fourier component, and dynamically fuses the output of different frequencies. Moreover, we provide a novel insight into the generalization ability of time series forecasting and propose the generalization bound of time series forecasting. Then we prove FreDF has a lower bound, indicating that FreDF has better generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FreDF.">

Though existing studies on driver attention prediction improved performance by incorporating advanced saliency detection techniques, they overlooked the opportunity to achieve human-inspired prediction by analyzing driving tasks from a cognitive science perspective. During driving, drivers' working memory and long-term memory play crucial roles in scene comprehension and experience retrieval, respectively. Together, they form situational awareness, facilitating drivers to quickly understand the current traffic situation and make optimal decisions based on past driving experiences. To explicitly integrate these two types of memory, this paper proposes an Adaptive Hybrid-Memory-Fusion (AHMF) driver attention prediction model to achieve more human-like predictions. Specifically, the model first encodes information about specific hazardous stimuli in the current scene to form working memories. Then, it adaptively retrieves similar situational experiences from the long-term memory for final prediction. Utilizing domain adaptation techniques, the model performs parallel training across multiple datasets, thereby enriching the accumulated driving experience within the long-term memory module. Compared to existing models, our model demonstrates significant improvements across various metrics on multiple public datasets, proving the effectiveness of integrating hybrid memories in driver attention prediction.">

In this paper, we empirically analyze forgetting that occurs in $N$ upstream examples while the model learns $M$ new tasks and visualize their associations with a $M \times N$ matrix. We empirically demonstrate that the degree of forgetting can often be approximated by simple multiplicative contributions of the upstream examples and newly learned tasks. We also reveal more complicated patterns where specific subsets of examples are forgotten with statistics and visualization.

Nonetheless, it remains unclear how to adapt these models to generate long multivariate time series. Viewing a time series as the discretization of an underlying continuous process, we introduce SigDiffusion, a novel diffusion model operating on log-signature embeddings of the data. The forward and backward processes gradually perturb and denoise log-signatures preserving their algebraic structure. To recover a signal from its log-signature, we provide new closed-form inversion formulae expressing the coefficients obtained by expanding the signal in a given basis (e.g. Fourier or orthogonal polynomials) as explicit polynomial functions of the log-signature. Finally, we show that combining SigDiffusion with these inversion formulae results in highly realistic time series generation, competitive with the current state-of-the-art on various datasets of synthetic and real-world examples.">

We build on that work to more deeply explore how token-level sparsity evolves over the course of training, and how it connects to broader sparsity patterns over the course of a sequence or batch, demonstrating that the different layers within small transformers exhibit distinctly layer-specific patterns on both of these fronts. In particular, we demonstrate that the first and last layer of the network have distinctive and in many ways inverted relationships to sparsity, and explore implications for the structure of feature representations being learned at different depths of the model.

        <tr id="The recurring neural network is a deep learning algorithm that is commonly used to develop prediction systems. There are many variants of RNN such as RNN itself, long-short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurring unit, so it is frequently debatable which algorithm from the RNN family has the most optimal efficiency and computation time. When developing a prediction system, sequential or time series data is required so that an accurate prediction can be made. Sequential or time series data involve data arranged in a time sequence, such as weather data, financial data, carbon emission data, and traffic data recorded over time. This research will be carried out by predicting the three RNN models against historical Bitcoin value data. The research method used is Experimental Design by comparing the performance between the three models on bitcoin value time series data, testing is done by involving hyperparameters such as Tanh, Sigmoid, and ReLU activation functions, batch size, and epochs. The aim of this research is to find out which RNN model can produce the most optimal performance and find out what performance measures can be used to evaluate and compare the performance between the three models. The results of the study show that LSTM is the most effective model with RMSE 0.012441 and MSE 0.000155 but inefficient because it takes 3 minutes 24 seconds to run the computation; in the meantime, the Tanh activation function gives the most optimal prediction than Sigmoid and RelU and therefore should be the main candidate to be used with RNN models when predicting Bitcoin prices.">

In addition to traditional statistical methods, advanced artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning can stand out with their ability to process complex data sets and adapt to historical data. In recent years, hybrid models combining deep learning and time series methods have demonstrated superior performance in stock selection and portfolio optimisation. This study comparatively analyses the performance of LSTM and ARIMA models in time series forecasting. In the study, the stock prices of Oracle company are predicted using two different models, LSTM and ARIMA. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. Both models have been found to be successful in different metrics. The LSTM model has lower error values; meanwhile, the ARIMA model produced proportionally more accurate forecasts. The study concludes that given the potential offered by deep learning, models such as LSTM are essential for time series forecasting. The flexibility of deep learning allows the development of customized models for different data types and time series problems.">

        <tr id="A dynamic weighted directed graph (DWDG) is commonly encountered in various application scenarios. It involves extensive dynamic interactions among numerous nodes. Most existing approaches explore the intricate temporal patterns hidden in a DWDG from the purely data-driven perspective, which suffers from accuracy loss when a DWDG exhibits strong fluctuations over time. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel Extended-Kalman-Filter-Incorporated Latent Feature (EKLF) model to represent a DWDG from the model-driven perspective. Its main idea is divided into the following two-fold ideas: a) adopting a control model, i.e., the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), to track the complex temporal patterns precisely with its nonlinear state-transition and observation functions; and b) introducing an alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to train the latent features (LFs) alternatively for precisely representing a DWDG. Empirical studies on DWDG datasets demonstrate that the proposed EKLF model outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for missing edge weights of a DWDG. It unveils the potential for precisely representing a DWDG by incorporating a control model.">

To build neural network models of time series (LSTM, GRU, RNN) and compare the results of forecasting with their mutual help and the results of standard models (ARIMA, ETS), in order to ascertain in which cases a certain group of models should be used.Methods. The paper provides a review of neural network models and considers the structure of RNN, LSTM, and GRU models. They are used for modeling time series in Russian macroeconomic statistics. The quality of model adjustment to the data and the quality of forecasts are compared experimentally. Neural network and standard models can be used both for the entire series and for its parts (trend and seasonality). When building a forecast for several time intervals in the future, two approaches are considered: building a forecast for the entire interval at once, and step-by-step forecasting. In this way there are several combinations of models that can be used for forecasting. These approaches are analyzed in the computational experiment.Results. Several experiments have been conducted in which standard (ARIMA, ETS, LOESS) and neural network models (LSTM, GRU, RNN) are built and compared in terms of proximity of the forecast to the series data in the test period.Conclusions. In the case of seasonal time series, models based on neural networks surpassed the standard ARIMA and ETS models in terms of forecast accuracy for the test period. The single-step forecast is computationally less efficient than the integral forecast for the entire target period. However, it is not possible to accurately indicate which approach is the best in terms of quality for a given series. Combined models (neural networks for trend, ARIMA for seasonality) almost always give good results. When forecasting a non-seasonal heteroskedastic series of share price, the standard approaches (LOESS method and ETS model) showed the best results.">

Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning based on graph neural networks to learn the spatio-temporal patterns from thickness information of shallow ice layers and make predictions for deep layers. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hybrid graph neural network that combines the GraphSAGE framework for graph feature learning with the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure for learning temporal changes, and introduce measurements of physical ice properties from Model Atmospheric Regional (MAR) weather model as physical node features.

        <tr id="Through integrating the evolutionary correlations across global states in the bidirectional recursion, an explainable Bayesian recurrent neural smoother (EBRNS) is proposed for offline data-assisted fixed-interval state smoothing. At first, the proposed model, containing global states in the evolutionary interval, is transformed into an equivalent model with bidirectional memory. This transformation incorporates crucial global state information with support for bi-directional recursive computation. For the transformed model, the joint state-memory-trend Bayesian filtering and smoothing frameworks are derived by introducing the bidirectional memory iteration mechanism and offline data into Bayesian estimation theory. The derived frameworks are implemented using the Gaussian approximation to ensure analytical properties and computational efficiency. Finally, the neural network modules within EBRNS and its two-stage training scheme are designed. Unlike most existing approaches that artificially combine deep learning and model-based estimation, the bidirectional recursion and internal gated structures of EBRNS are naturally derived from Bayesian estimation theory, explainably integrating prior model knowledge, online measurement, and offline data. Experiments on representative real-world datasets demonstrate that the high smoothing accuracy of EBRNS is accompanied by data efficiency and a lightweight parameter scale.">

Continual pre-training (CPT) enhances LLM capabilities by imbuing new domain-specific or proprietary knowledge while replaying general corpus to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The data mixture ratio of general corpus and domain-specific corpus, however, has been chosen heuristically, leading to sub-optimal training efficiency in practice. In this context, we attempt to re-visit the scaling behavior of LLMs under the hood of CPT, and discover a power-law relationship between loss, mixture ratio, and training tokens scale. We formalize the trade-off between general and domain-specific capabilities, leading to a well-defined Critical Mixture Ratio (CMR) of general and domain data. By striking the balance, CMR maintains the model's general ability and achieves the desired domain transfer, ensuring the highest utilization of available resources. Therefore, if we value the balance between efficiency and effectiveness, CMR can be consider as the optimal mixture ratio.Through extensive experiments, we ascertain the predictability of CMR, and propose CMR scaling law and have substantiated its generalization. These findings offer practical guidelines for optimizing LLM training in specialized domains, ensuring both general and domain-specific performance while efficiently managing training resources.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields, including economics, finance, and weather prediction. This study explores the application of time series forecasting techniques to predict future values based on historical data patterns. Different models, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and exponential smoothing, are commonly employed to capture the underlying trends, seasonality, and irregularities in time series data. The accuracy of the forecasts depends on selecting the appropriate model and fine-tuning its parameters. Regular validation and refinement of the forecasting models are essential to ensure their reliability and adaptability to changing conditions. Overall, time series forecasting serves as a valuable tool for decision-making, resource allocation, and planning in numerous domains. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used in this research to predict Albanian exports. The ARIMA models provided reliable forecasts for the near future and placed more importance on recent observations rather than distant past data. However, a limitation of this study is the lack of using multiple models on new data to improve future forecasts. Considering the significance of exports in Albania, it is crucial to periodically validate and refine the model-building exercises. Based on the findings, the study recommends using the ARIMA (3,2,3) model for forecasting. Furthermore, the forecast errors were statistically tested and validated, confirming the model's strong predictive ability. It is important to note that a forecasting technique that performs well in one situation may not be suitable for another. Therefore, the validation of a specific model should be regularly assessed as time progresses. For the purpose of forecasting the annual exports of Albania, researchers can employ these models.">

The contribution lies in using GMM for the initial classification of bearing states and LSTM to predict the precise location of potential bearing failures. This hybrid model leverages Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) for robust feature extraction, creating a nuanced input representation for the LSTM. Our approach delineates a state-of-the-art method for real-time health monitoring and failure prognosis in rotating machinery, offering substantial advancements in predictive maintenance. The model is rigorously validated on distinct datasets, confirming its ability to generalize with high precision and recall rates while effectively circumventing overfitting. It successfully determines not only the condition of bearings but also identifies the exact bearing that may fail, providing a critical tool for preemptive maintenance actions. This integrated methodology of GMMs for state determination combined with the temporal prediction capabilities of LSTM sets a new precedent in the predictive maintenance domain, showcasing the potential for significant reductions in unplanned downtime and maintenance costs.

This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables.

Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out.

 Time series data prediction holds a significant importance in various applications. In this study, we specifically concentrate on long-time series data prediction. Recurrent Neural Networks are widely recognized as a fundamental neural network architecture for processing effectively time-series data. Recurrent Neural Network models encounter the gradient disappearance or gradient explosion challenge in long series data. To resolve the gradient problem and improve accuracy, the Fractional Order Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Network (FOLRNN) model is proposed to predict long time series in this paper. The proposed method uses the Lipschitz continuity to alleviate the gradient problem. The fractional order integration is applied to compute the hidden states of the Recurrent Neural Network in the proposed method. The intricate dynamics of long-time series data can be captured by fractional order calculus. It has more accurate predictions compared with Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks models. Then self-attention is used to improve feature representation. It can describe the correlation of features and improve predict performance. Some experiments show that the FOLRNN model achieves better results than other methods.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The rebalancing of bikes and demand prediction at the station level plays a fundamental role in the regular operation and maintenance of bike-sharing systems (BSSs). In this paper, a novel model which incorporates discrete wavelet transform (DWT), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and long-short term memory neural network (LSTM NN), is proposed for BSS station-level check-in/out demand prediction. This study adopts the wavelet analysis method to denoise the raw BSS demand series firstly. Then, DWT is developed to decompose the denoised sequence into three high-frequency components (i.e. details) and one low-frequency component (i.e. approximation). ARIMA and LSTM are employed to forecast the detailed components and one approximation component, respectively. The predicted results of each model are reconstructed into the final outputs by DWT. An experiment on a real-world trip dataset showed that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the standard ARIMA model and LSTM model.">

Traditional classification techniques often struggle to effectively handle the uncertainties and imprecision inherent in time series data. To address this challenge, fuzzy time series models have emerged as a promising alternative, offering a flexible framework capable of capturing the uncertainties and vagueness intrinsic to temporal patterns. In this paper, we propose an Optimized Time Series Interval Valued Fuzzy System (OTS-IVFS) that leverages the power of type-2 fuzzy logic to handle temporal data effectively and provide fully explainable models. We have performed experiments on five data sets from a diverse set of use cases. Our system significantly outperforms the best-in-class algorithms for the Earthquake dataset by 16.67% increase in accuracy while giving comparable results in 3 other datasets, whilst maintaining full interpretability.">

        <tr id="Evaluating the performance of causal discovery algorithms that aim to find causal relationships between time-dependent processes remains a challenging topic. In this paper, we show that certain characteristics of datasets, such as varsortability (Reisach et al. 2021) and $R^2$-sortability (Reisach et al. 2023), also occur in datasets for autocorrelated stationary time series. We illustrate this empirically using four types of data: simulated data based on SVAR models and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, the data used in the 2019 causality-for-climate challenge (Runge et al. 2019), real-world river stream datasets, and real-world data generated by the Causal Chamber of (Gamella et al. 2024). To do this, we adapt var- and $R^2$-sortability to time series data. We also investigate the extent to which the performance of score-based causal discovery methods goes hand in hand with high sortability. Arguably, our most surprising finding is that the investigated real-world datasets exhibit high varsortability and low $R^2$-sortability indicating that scales may carry a significant amount of causal information.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we explore advanced modifications to the Tweedie regression model in order to address its limitations in modeling aggregate claims for various types of insurance such as automobile, health, and liability. Traditional Tweedie models, while effective in capturing the probability and magnitude of claims, usually fall short in accurately representing the large incidence of zero claims. Our recommended approach involves a refined modeling of the zero-claim process, together with the integration of boosting methods in order to help leverage an iterative process to enhance predictive accuracy. Despite the inherent slowdown in learning algorithms due to this iteration, several efficient implementation techniques that also help precise tuning of parameter like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost have emerged. Nonetheless, we chose to utilize CatBoost, a efficient boosting approach that effectively handles categorical and other special types of data. The core contribution of our paper is the assembly of separate modeling for zero claims and the application of tree-based boosting ensemble methods within a CatBoost framework, assuming that the inflated probability of zero is a function of the mean parameter. The efficacy of our enhanced Tweedie model is demonstrated through the application of an insurance telematics dataset, which presents the additional complexity of compositional feature variables. Our modeling results reveal a marked improvement in model performance, showcasing its potential to deliver more accurate predictions suitable for insurance claim analytics.">

Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see \url{https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm}).">

        <tr id="We devise a novel method for implied volatility smoothing based on neural operators. The goal of implied volatility smoothing is to construct a smooth surface that links the collection of prices observed at a specific instant on a given option market. Such price data arises highly dynamically in ever-changing spatial configurations, which poses a major limitation to foundational machine learning approaches using classical neural networks. While large models in language and image processing deliver breakthrough results on vast corpora of raw data, in financial engineering the generalization from big historical datasets has been hindered by the need for considerable data pre-processing. In particular, implied volatility smoothing has remained an instance-by-instance, hands-on process both for neural network-based and traditional parametric strategies. Our general operator deep smoothing approach, instead, directly maps observed data to smoothed surfaces. We adapt the graph neural operator architecture to do so with high accuracy on ten years of raw intraday S&P 500 options data, using a single set of weights. The trained operator adheres to critical no-arbitrage constraints and is robust with respect to subsampling of inputs (occurring in practice in the context of outlier removal). We provide extensive historical benchmarks and showcase the generalization capability of our approach in a comparison with SVI, an industry standard parametrization for implied volatility. The operator deep smoothing approach thus opens up the use of neural networks on large historical datasets in financial engineering.">

        <tr id="Despite the massive attention given to time-series explanations due to their extensive applications, a notable limitation in existing approaches is their primary reliance on the time-domain. This overlooks the inherent characteristic of time-series data containing both time and frequency features. In this work, we present Spectral eXplanation (SpectralX), an XAI framework that provides time-frequency explanations for time-series black-box classifiers. This easily adaptable framework enables users to"plug-in"various perturbation-based XAI methods for any pre-trained time-series classification models to assess their impact on the explanation quality without having to modify the framework architecture. Additionally, we introduce Feature Importance Approximations (FIA), a new perturbation-based XAI method. These methods consist of feature insertion, deletion, and combination techniques to enhance computational efficiency and class-specific explanations in time-series classification tasks. We conduct extensive experiments in the generated synthetic dataset and various UCR Time-Series datasets to first compare the explanation performance of FIA and other existing perturbation-based XAI methods in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, and then show the superiority of our FIA in the time-frequency domain with the SpectralX framework. Finally, we conduct a user study to confirm the practicality of our FIA in SpectralX framework for class-specific time-frequency based time-series explanations.

Two representative channel strategies are closely associated with model expressivity and robustness, including channel independence (CI) and channel dependence (CD). The former adopts individual channel treatment and has been shown to be more robust to distribution shifts, but lacks sufficient capacity to model meaningful channel interactions. The latter is more expressive for representing complex cross-channel dependencies, but is prone to overfitting. To balance the two strategies, we present a channel-aware low-rank adaptation method to condition CD models on identity-aware individual components. As a plug-in solution, it is adaptable for a wide range of backbone architectures. Extensive experiments show that it can consistently and significantly improve the performance of both CI and CD models with demonstrated efficiency and flexibility.

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) are prominent in predictive analytics for accurately forecasting target variables. However, inherent uncertainties necessitate constructing prediction intervals for reliability. The existing literature often lacks practical methodologies for creating predictive intervals, especially for time series with trends and seasonal patterns. This paper explicitly details a practical approach integrating dual-output Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDO) with DNNs to approximate predictive means and variances within a Bayesian framework, enabling forecast interval construction. The dual-output architecture employs a custom loss function, combining mean squared error with Softplus-derived predictive variance, ensuring non-negative variance values. Hyperparameter optimization is performed through a grid search exploring activation functions, dropout rates, epochs, and batch sizes. Empirical distributions of predictive means and variances from the MCDO demonstrate the results of the dual-output MCDO DNNs. The proposed method achieves a significant improvement in forecast accuracy, with an RMSE reduction of about 10% compared to the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model. Additionally, the method provides more reliable forecast intervals, as evidenced by a higher coverage proportion and narrower interval widths. A case study on Thailand’s durian export data showcases the method’s utility and applicability to other datasets with trends and/or seasonal components.">

        <tr id="Capturing long-term dependency from historical behaviors is the key to the success of sequential recommendation; however, existing methods focus on extracting global sequential information while neglecting to obtain deep representations from subsequences. Previous research has revealed that the restricted inter-item transfer is fundamental to sequential modeling, and some potential substructures of sequences can help models learn more effective long-term dependency compared to the whole sequence. To automatically find better subsequences and perform efficient learning, we propose a sequential recommendation model with a gated recurrent unit and Transformers, abbreviated as GAT4Rec, which employs Transformers with shared parameters across layers to model users’ historical interaction sequences. The representation learned by the gated recurrent unit is used as the gating signal to identify the optimal substructure in user sequences. The fused representation of the subsequence and edge information is extracted by the encoding layer to make the corresponding recommendations. Experimental results on four well-known publicly available datasets demonstrate that our GAT4Rec model outperforms other recommendation models, achieving performance improvements of 5.77%, 1.35%, 11.58%, and 1.79% in the normalized discounted cumulative gain metric (NDCG@10), respectively.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a new method to determine the optimal batch size for applying deep learning models with time series data. A set of batch sizes is determined by considering the length of the repetition pattern of the data using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A comparative analysis is conducted to identify the impact of varying batch sizes on prediction errors for the three deep learning models. The results show that the RNN model has the optimal batch size that produces the minimum prediction error. In the DNN and CNN models, the optimal batch size is not correlated with the repetition pattern of time series data. Therefore, it is not recommended to apply CNN and DNN models of time series data. However, if used, a small batch size can be selected to reduce training time. In addition, the range of prediction error according to batch size is significantly larger for RNN models compared to DNN and CNN models.">

        <tr id="Time series data is widely available in a variety of industries. By forecasting time series, decision-makers can better grasp future trends and make more effective decisions. Financial time series data exhibit non-stationarity and high volatility. High-frequency fluctuations in financial products such as exchange rates, bonds and equities may reflect external shocks and risks in global financial markets, which are potentially dangerous and may threaten national economic security or even trigger financial crises. For financial time series data, a deep recurrent neural network first progressively processes each data point in the time series through its recurrent unit. Each recurring unit can adjust its own weights to better predict or analyze future values. Over time, these recurrent units continuously update their internal state, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of the entire data sequence. In addition, we add a gating mechanism to further improve the network's ability to control the flow of information, so that the model is more effective when retaining long-term dependencies, so as to improve the accuracy of prediction and the stability of the model. Experimental results show that our recurrent neural network model shows higher prediction accuracy and stability than other baseline models on financial time series datasets.">

        <tr id="Dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) exhibit variations in constraints, decision parameter quantities, and the number of objectives over time, leading to changes in their optimal solutions. Prediction-based methods currently stand as the prevailing paradigm for handling DMOPs. Implicit correlations among solutions ob-tained at consecutive time steps while solving DMOPs con-tinuously can guide predictions for future time increments in the time series. Most existing methods rely on a single linear or nonlinear model to capture the correlations of historical optimal solutions. However, a linear model struggles with the nonlinear scenario, and using a nonlinear model to fit the linear relationship of the historical optimal solutions increases the training time because the nonlinear model has more parameters. This paper proposes a novel framework for time series ensemble prediction based on correlation type detection TSEPFCTD. The framework leverages correlation type detection strategy to identify the autocorrelation types in the time series of historical solutions. Subsequently, distinct prediction models are applied for different types, enhancing prediction accuracy. We implement this prediction framework on MOEA/D-DE, constructing a novel algorithm for solving DMOPs. Experimental results on a series of test suites demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in providing robust solution outcomes.">

In contemporary research, there has been a notable upsurge in exploring feature extraction through random sampling. Unlike deep convolutional networks, these methods sidestep elaborate training procedures, yet they often necessitate generating a surplus of features to comprehensively encapsulate time series nuances. Consequently, some features may lack relevance to labels or exhibit multi-collinearity with others. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical feature selection method aided by ANOVA variance analysis to address this challenge. Through meticulous experimentation, we demonstrate that our method substantially reduces features by over 94% while preserving accuracy -- a significant advancement in the field of time series analysis and feature selection.">

In light of recent advances in machine learning and deep learning, this study aims to assess and compare the efficacy of LSTM neural networks and Informer models in stock price forecasting.

The methodology includes the following steps: data collection and preprocessing, model construction, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation.

        <tr id="Effective hospital resource management is crucial for service cost and workforce efficiency, especially during abnormal situations with sudden changes in patient volumes. Hospitals often face challenges in resource management and find it difficult to predict patient numbers due to uncertain and volatile data. If a hospital can accurately predict the number of patients during abnormal situations, it can allocate resources to align with the expected patient influx. This helps the hospital maintain appropriate costs and optimize workforce efficiency. In this research, we propose a solution to predict the number of daily outpatient visits from a private hospital in Thailand during the COVID-19 outbreak period as a case study. We use the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to preprocess the data by decomposing it into intrinsic mode functions, reducing the impact of data volatility and predict these intrinsic mode functions using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with the service utilization pattern (seasonal value) as a lookback period to enhance prediction efficiency. This approach is referred to as the EEMD-LSTM model. Experimental results indicate that, compared to LSTM, ARIMA, and AutoML models evaluated for prediction periods of 7, 14, 21, and 28 days using metrics including MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and MAE Ratio, the EEMD-LSTM model demonstrates superior performance in predicting patient numbers during abnormal events. Unlike other models, the EEMD-LSTM model exhibits minimal changes in error when the prediction period is adjusted, highlighting its robustness. Overall, the EEMD-LSTM model consistently outperforms all other models assessed. When applied to data from the orthopedic department, although the MAE values are similar, noticeable differences in trends are observed. Moreover, when predicting data from the pediatric department, the EEMD-LSTM model proves to be more effective than all other models. This model can be effectively utilized by hospitals for resource management and planning, including medication and staffing, ensuring optimal service delivery to patients during abnormal situations.">

        <tr id="Fuzzy neural network (FNN) is regarded as a prominent approach in application of time-series modeling. With the capability of fuzzy reasoning, FNN can capture temporal patterns from the time-series samples. However, the existing FNNs may suffer from the temporal pattern distortion because possibly multiscale features cannot be explored sufficiently. To address this problem, a time-aware fuzzy neural network, based on the frequency-enhanced modulation mechanism (FEM-TAFNN), is developed for time-series prediction in this article. First, a Fourier-based decoder is established to extract the multiscale features. This decoder employs the frequency-domain model to orthogonally separate the time-scale features with different frequencies into independent temporal patterns based on the Fourier basis, which prevents the overlap of temporal patterns using time-domain analysis. Second, a frequency-enhanced modulation mechanism is designed to shape fuzzy rules of FNN based on the contribution of different temporal patterns in the frequency spectrum. It enables FEM-TAFNN to modulate out the realistic multiscale temporal patterns. Finally, the proposed FEM-TAFNN is tested on four multiscale time-series datasets. The empirical results confirm its superior prediction performance than other methods.">

A fundamental and crucial requirement for representation learning in CTDGs is the appropriate estimation and preservation of proximity.

Despite its importance, this property presents significant challenges due to the computationally intensive nature of personalized interaction intensity estimation and the dynamic attributes of CTDGs. To this end, we propose a novel Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional encoding that incorporates a parameter-free personalized interaction intensity estimation under the weak assumption of the Poisson Point Process. Building on this, we introduce the Dynamic Graph Transformer with \Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding (CorDGT), which efficiently retains the evolving spatial-temporal high-order proximity for effective node representation learning in CTDGs.

We propose the Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression (HQR) model and the Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference (WACI) method, providing theoretical coverage guarantees, to overcome those issues, respectively.

Stream Learning on data streams with recurrent concept drifts attempts to learn from such streams of data.

The survey underscores the significance of the field and its practical applications, delving into nuanced definitions of machine learning for data streams afflicted by recurrent concept drifts. It explores diverse methodological approaches, elucidating their key design components. Additionally, it examines various evaluation techniques, benchmark datasets, and available software tailored for simulating and analysing data streams with recurrent concept drifts. Concluding, the survey offers insights into potential avenues for future research in the field.">

        <tr id="With the rapid digitization of the world, an increasing number of real-world applications are turning to non-Euclidean data, modeled as graphs. Due to their intrinsic high complexity and irregularity, learning from graph data demands tremendous computational power. Recently, CMOS-compatible Ising machines, i.e., dynamical systems fabricated with CMOS technologies, have emerged as a new approach that harnesses the inherent power of nature within dynamical systems to efficiently resolve binary optimization problems and have been adopted for traditional graph computation, such as max-cut. However, when performing complex Graph Learning (GL) tasks, Ising machines face significant hurdles: (i) they are binary and thus ill-suited for real-valued problems; (ii) their expensive all-to-all coupling network that guarantees generality for optimization problems poses daunting scalability concerns.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a nature-powered graph learning framework dubbed DS-GL, which is the first effort to transform the process of solving graph learning problems into the natural annealing process within a parameterized dynamical system embodied as a CMOS chip. To tackle the two major hurdles, DS-GL first augments the Ising machine architecture to modify the self-reaction term of its Hamiltonian function from linear to quadratic, effectively serving as an energy regulator. This adjustment maintains the system’s original physical interpretation while enabling it to process continuous, real-valued data. Second, to address the scaling issue, DS-GL further upgrades the real-valued dense Ising machine by decomposing it into a mesh-based multi-PE dynamical system that supports efficient distributed spatial-temporal co-annealing across different PEs through sparse interconnects. By exploiting the inherent sparsity and community structures in real-world graphs, DS-GL is able to map complex graph learning tasks onto the scalable dynamical system while maintaining high accuracy. Evaluations with four diverse GL applications across seven real-world datasets, including traffic flow and COVID-19 prediction, show that DS-GL can deliver from 103 × to 105 × speedups over Graph Neural Networks on GPUs while operating at a power 2 orders of magnitude lower than GPUs, with 5% – 30% accuracy enhancement.">

        <tr id="Deep learning (DL) has been widely applied to forecast the sales volume of household appliances with high accuracy. Unfortunately, in small towns, due to the limited amount of historical sales data, it is difficult to forecast household appliance sales accurately. To overcome the above-mentioned challenge, we propose a novel household appliance sales forecasting algorithm based on transfer learning, temporal convolutional network (TCN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and attention mechanism (called “TransTLA”). Firstly, we combine TCN and LSTM to exploit the spatiotemporal correlation of sales data. Secondly, we utilize the attention mechanism to make full use of the features of sales data. Finally, in order to mitigate the impact of data scarcity and regional differences, a transfer learning technique is used to improve the predictive performance in small towns, with the help of the learning experience from the megacity. The experimental outcomes reveal that the proposed TransTLA model significantly outperforms traditional forecasting methods in predicting small town household appliance sales volumes. Specifically, TransTLA achieves an average mean absolute error (MAE) improvement of 27.60% over LSTM, 9.23% over convolutional neural networks (CNN), and 11.00% over the CNN-LSTM-Attention model across one to four step-ahead predictions. This study addresses the data scarcity problem in small town sales forecasting, helping businesses improve inventory management, enhance customer satisfaction, and contribute to a more efficient supply chain, benefiting the overall economy.">

        <tr id="Solar energy has become a promising renewable energy source, offering significant opportunities for photovoltaic (PV) systems. Accurate and reliable PV generation forecasts are crucial for efficient grid integration and optimized system planning. However, the complexity of environmental factors, including seasonal and daily patterns, as well as social behaviors and user habits, presents significant challenges. Traditional prediction models often struggle with capturing the complex nonlinear dynamics in multivariate time series, leading to low prediction accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new PV power prediction method that considers factors such as light, air pressure, wind direction, and social behavior, assigning different weights to them to accurately extract nonlinear feature relationships. The framework integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) to capture local time features, while bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and an attention mechanism extract global spatiotemporal relationships, effectively capturing key features related to historical output. This improves the accuracy of multi-step predictions. To verify the feasibility of the method for multivariate time series, we conducted experiments using PV power prediction as a scenario and compared the results with LSTM, CNN, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM and GRU models. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms these models, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 12.133, root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.234, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.1%, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.895. These results indicate the effectiveness and potential of the method in PV prediction tasks.">

 Data-driven methodologies have been used in reservoir management and production forecasting, particularly demonstrating remarkable efficacy in short-term oil production forecasts. However, there is space to improve its prediction, especially in tackling the complexities of challenging reservoirs, such as the heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs from Brazilian Pre-salt fields. Methods for oil production forecasting in the petroleum literature generally consider linear correlations or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this paper, we propose a new strategy to improve short-term forecasting for oil production through attention mechanisms that boost state-of-the-art methods. Traditional data-driven techniques generally do not consider static data or planned activities. However, we address this critical gap by leveraging the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) to integrate such information into our short-term forecasting. Transformers, the architectural inspiration behind ChatGPT, employ attention mechanisms to establish relationships between different time series data points, assigning weights to these connections. We jointly explore oil, gas, and water production, pressure, and the ratios between them. This method includes static data (e.g., geographical coordinates) as well as known side reservoir information. Such side information can be, for instance, another predicted future production or planned well shut-ins. We also investigate which side information improves the obtained forecasting. This paper presents two main findings. First, it shows how using certain side information can improve the overall predictive capability of a model. For example, using predicted gas production as side information can significantly improve the oil production forecast. This is logical and in line with expectations, as there is an intimate connection between oil and gas production. In the second application of TFT, we considered well closures as the side information. We used an anomaly detection tool to identify well closures in the history period and converted it to usable side information for the TFT model. The distribution of these well closures is used as a guide to predict our target oil production. As we considered the distribution of well closures as side information, we framed our results in terms of cumulative oil production rather than daily forecast rates. The results of this work show that the cumulative production gets very close to the ground-truth data, better than linear and proposed baselines. In summary, the second key result shows and underscores the significance of incorporating side information within our TFT approach.">

        <tr id="In this study, a long short-term memory network (LSTM) model is used to predict the population size and risk level of each country in 2030 by combining global population data from 1950 to 2021 and country risk rating indices from 1954 to 2023.The core of the LSTM model is its three gating units: forgetting gates, input gates, and output gates, which enable the model to effectively deal with the long-term dependence problems and avoid the problems of gradient vanishing and gradient explosion in traditional recurrent neural networks. Through correlation analysis of the input data and prediction errors, as well as an autocorrelation study of the errors, the model shows prediction accuracy at certain time delays, although the prediction errors of the model are not observed to be completely random on certain delay terms, implying that the model may need further optimisation in these areas. In addition, this study applies the entropy method to calculate the construction suitability evaluation index for each country in 2030, which provides a scientific basis for the development of future construction strategies. By analysing the mean square error (MSE) during the training process, the study shows that the performance of the model on the training and validation sets gradually improves as the number of training rounds increases, although the MSE on the test set increases at some points, showing signs of overfitting. Finally, countries were scored and ranked for construction suitability based on predicted population and risk class scores. Based on the composite suitability score index, we categorised the countries into three building suitability classes, each corresponding to a different building strategy. In areas of low suitability, robust materials and designs that are resistant to natural hazards are recommended; in areas of moderate suitability, sustainable building design and green building materials are recommended; and in areas of high suitability, investment in high-quality and high-end design building projects should be emphasised to meet the needs of higher-income groups. These strategies will contribute to the needs of different regions and populations and improve the accuracy and efficiency of real estate decisions. Through the application of this deep learning model, we have not only improved our ability to predict global population dynamics and construction risks, but also provided important data support for urban planning and development strategies on a global scale.">

In this work, we collected a comprehensive dataset spanning 308 cities in China, encompassing data on seven pollutants as well as meteorological variables from January 2015 to September 2022.

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in diverse domains, ranging from urban planning to pandemic management. Ensuring both accuracy and robustness in GNNs remains a challenge due to insufficient quality data that contains sufficient features. With sufficient training data where all spatiotemporal patterns are well-represented, existing GNN models can make reasonably accurate predictions. However, existing methods fail when the training data are drawn from different circumstances (e.g., traffic patterns on regular days) than test data (e.g., traffic patterns after a natural disaster). Such challenges are usually classified under domain generalization. In this work, we show that one way to address this challenge in the context of spatiotemporal prediction is by incorporating domain differential equations into graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We theoretically derive conditions where GCNs incorporating such domain differential equations are robust to mismatched training and testing data compared to baseline domain agnostic models. To support our theory, we propose two domain-differential-equation-informed networks: Reaction-Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (RDGCN), which incorporates differential equations for traffic speed evolution, and the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered Graph Convolutional Network (SIRGCN), which incorporates a disease propagation model. Both RDGCN and SIRGCN are based on reliable and interpretable domain differential equations that allow the models to generalize to unseen patterns. We experimentally show that RDGCN and SIRGCN are more robust with mismatched testing data than state-of-the-art deep learning methods.">

Some advanced algorithms for incorporating other surrounding site information have been proposed, such as graph neural network-based methods, which are usually based on static or dynamic graphs to build spatial dependencies between sites. However, the possibility of the simultaneous existence of multiple spatial dependencies is not considered. This paper establishes a spatiotemporal prediction model based on hybrid spatiotemporal graph neural network. In this model, we apply adaptive hybrid graph learning to learn composite spatial correlations among multiple sites. A temporal convolution module with multi-subsequence temporal data input is used to extract local semantic information to better predict future nonlinear temporal dependencies. A spatiotemporal adaptive fusion module is added to address the issue of integrating diverse spatiotemporal trends among multiple sites. To assess the model's predictive performance, nine solar radiation observation stations were selected in two different climatic environments. The average root mean square error (RMSE) of the constructed model was 38.51 and 49.90 W/m2, with average mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.72 and 23.06 W/m2, respectively. Single-site and multi-site prediction models were selected as baseline models. Compared with the baseline models, the RMSE and MAE reduce by 3.1%–20.8% and 8.9%–32.8%, respectively, across all sites. The proposed model demonstrates the effectiveness of improving accuracy in forecasting solar irradiance through multi-site predictions.">

        <tr id="Studying low-likelihood high-impact extreme weather events in a warming world is a significant and challenging task for current ensemble forecasting systems. While these systems presently use up to 100 members, larger ensembles could enrich the sampling of internal variability. They may capture the long tails associated with climate hazards better than traditional ensemble sizes. Due to computational constraints, it is infeasible to generate huge ensembles (comprised of 1,000-10,000 members) with traditional, physics-based numerical models. In this two-part paper, we replace traditional numerical simulations with machine learning (ML) to generate hindcasts of huge ensembles. In Part I, we construct an ensemble weather forecasting system based on Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO), and we discuss important design decisions for constructing such an ensemble. The ensemble represents model uncertainty through perturbed-parameter techniques, and it represents initial condition uncertainty through bred vectors, which sample the fastest growing modes of the forecast. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) as a baseline, we develop an evaluation pipeline composed of mean, spectral, and extreme diagnostics. Using large-scale, distributed SFNOs with 1.1 billion learned parameters, we achieve calibrated probabilistic forecasts. As the trajectories of the individual members diverge, the ML ensemble mean spectra degrade with lead time, consistent with physical expectations. However, the individual ensemble members' spectra stay constant with lead time. Therefore, these members simulate realistic weather states, and the ML ensemble thus passes a crucial spectral test in the literature. The IFS and ML ensembles have similar Extreme Forecast Indices, and we show that the ML extreme weather forecasts are reliable and discriminating.">

        <tr id="Neural networks are becoming increasingly widely used in various fields, especially for academic risk forecasts. Academic risk prediction is a hot topic in the field of big data in education that aims to identify and help students who experience great academic difficulties. In recent years, the use of machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms to achieve academic risk prediction has garnered increased attention and development. However, most of these studies use nontime series data as features for prediction, which are slightly insufficient in terms of timeliness. Therefore, this article focuses on time series data features that are more expressive of changes in students' learning status and uses multivariate time series data as predictive features. This article proposes a method based on multivariate time series features and a neural network to predict academic risk. The method includes three steps: first, the multivariate time series feature is extracted from the interaction records of the students' online learning platforms; second, the multivariate time series feature transformation model ROCKET is applied to convert the multivariate time series feature into a new feature; third, the new feature is converted into a final prediction result using a linear classification model. Comparative tests show that the proposed method has high effectiveness.">

Gold price forecasting is important for investors as decisions making tool. This study aims to study the best long short--term memory (LSTM) hyperparameters (optimizer, learning rate, and epoch) from cross--validation for forecasting. LSTM, as part of deep learning methods, is developed based on a RNN widely used in time series forecasting. LSTM is superior compared to other methods for its ability to minimize errors and forecast for long--term periods. Walk--forward validation with sliding and extending window scenarios as a form of cross--validation is used to see the method's accuracy. The used data is sourced from the World Gold Council with daily data periods for January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2023. The optimizer used is Adam and RMSProp, each with learning rate values of 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, and epoch values of 100, 500, 1000. The best model uses the Adam optimizer, a learning rate of 0.01, and an epoch value of 100 with a MAPE value of 0.4867\% in the validation process. Forecasting results show a tendency for gold prices to increase in the next eight years.">

        <tr id="Echo state network (ESN) implements an alternative paradigm called reservoir computing to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where internal weights are randomly generated and kept fixed, and only readout weights need to be trained, which greatly reduces the training complexity of RNNs. ESN not only facilitates the practical implementation of RNNs but also shows superior performance over fully trained RNNs across a range of applications. However, the conventional ESN suffers from the drawbacks of stringent conditions for weight convergence and slow convergence speed. This paper proposes a memory regressor extended learning method to update the readout weights of ESNs. By constructing and incorporating a generalized prediction error based on regressor extension and filtering, the capacity of ESN to utilize historical data can be greatly improved. In the discrete-time domain, it is proven that exponential convergence of readout weights is achieved under a condition termed interval excitation that is strictly weaker than the classical condition of persistent excitation. Simulation results on modeling a 10th-order nonlinear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) system have revealed that the proposed approach accelerates weight convergence speed almost ten times higher compared to the conventional ESN.">

Short time series can exhibit long-range correlations that reveal significant features not easily discernible in longer ones. Such short time series find utility in AI applications for training models to recognize patterns, make predictions, and perform classification tasks. However, traditional methods like DFA fail as classifiers for monofractal short time series, especially when the series are very short. In this study, we evaluate the performance of the traditional DFA method against the CNN-SVM approach of neural networks as classifiers for different monofractal models. We examine their performance as a function of the decreasing length of synthetic samples. The results demonstrate that CNN-SVM achieves superior classification rates compared to DFA. The overall accuracy rate of CNN-SVM ranges between 64% and 98%, whereas DFA’s accuracy rate ranges between 16% and 64%.">

        <tr id="Climaate prediction plays a vital role in various sectors, including agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning. Traditional methods for climate forecasting often rely on complex physical models, which require substantial computational resources and may not accurately capture local weather patterns. This study explores the potential of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, for predicting daily climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity. Utilizing historical climate data from the city of Delhi, we developed an LSTM model to forecast short-term climate trends. The model consists of two LSTM layers followed by three Dense layers and is compiled with the Adam optimizer, mean squared error loss, and mean absolute error as a metric. Our results demonstrate the model's capability to capture temporal dependencies in climate data, achieving a satisfactory level of accuracy in temperature forecasting. This research underscores the potential of machine learning techniques, particularly LSTM networks, in enhancing climate prediction and contributing to more informed decision-making in weather-sensitive sectors.">

        <tr id="In this work, we present a novel methodology for performing the supervised classification of time-ordered noisy data; we call this methodology Entropic Sparse Probabilistic Approximation with Markov regularization (eSPA-Markov). It is an extension of entropic learning methodologies, allowing the simultaneous learning of segmentation patterns, entropy-optimal feature space discretizations, and Bayesian classification rules. We prove the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the learning problem solution and propose a one-shot numerical learning algorithm that—in the leading order—scales linearly in dimension. We show how this technique can be used for the computationally scalable identification of persistent (metastable) regime affiliations and regime switches from high-dimensional non-stationary and noisy time series, i.e., when the size of the data statistics is small compared to their dimensionality and when the noise variance is larger than the variance in the signal. We demonstrate its performance on a set of toy learning problems, comparing eSPA-Markov to state-of-the-art techniques, including deep learning and random forests. We show how this technique can be used for the analysis of noisy time series from DNA and RNA Nanopore sequencing.">
