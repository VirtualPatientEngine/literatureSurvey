        <tr id="Significance Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.">

        <tr id="Significance Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science. The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.">

        <tr id="Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.">

        <tr id="Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.">

        <tr id="Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.">

There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems (MANDy) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions.

For nonlinear systems, however, small modeling errors can lead to significant deviations from the true, measured behavior. Even in mechanical systems, where the equations are assumed to be well-known, there are often model discrepancies corresponding to nonlinear friction, wind resistance, etc. Discovering models for these discrepancies remains an open challenge for many complex systems. In this work, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to discover a model for the discrepancy between a simplified model and measurement data. In particular, we assume that the model mismatch can be sparsely represented in a library of candidate model terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several examples including experimental data from a double pendulum on a cart.

However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further modification.">

        <tr id="Researchers propose sparse regression for identifying governing partial differential equations for spatiotemporal systems. We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.">

        <tr id="Sparse model identification enables the discovery of nonlinear dynamical systems purely from data; however, this approach is sensitive to noise, especially in the low-data limit. In this work, we leverage the statistical approach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to several synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate substantial improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected from 1900 to 1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be exploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.">

Sparse regression, in particular, has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: 1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning; 2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations; and 3) the methods apply to composite regularizers, essential for total variation (TV) as well as sparsity-promoting formulations using tight frames. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, and greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. Following standards of reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.">

        <tr id="The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective technique to produce interpretable models of dynamical systems from time-resolved state data via sparse regression. However, to model parameterized systems, SINDy requires data from transient trajectories for various parameter values over the range of interest, which are typically difficult to acquire experimentally. In this work, we extend SINDy to be able to leverage data on fixed points and/or limit cycles to reduce the number of transient trajectories needed for successful system identification. To achieve this, we incorporate the data on these attractors at various parameter values as constraints in the optimization problem. First, we show that enforcing these as hard constraints leads to an ill-conditioned regression problem due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we implement soft constraints by modifying the cost function to be minimized. This leads to the formulation of a multi-objective sparse regression problem where we simultaneously seek to minimize the error of the fit to the transients trajectories and to the data on attractors, while penalizing the number of terms in the model. Our extension, demonstrated on several numerical examples, is more robust to noisy measurements and requires substantially less training data than the original SINDy method to correctly identify a parameterized dynamical system.">

Our method automates calculating partial derivatives, constructing a candidate library, and estimating a sparse model. We rigorously evaluate the performance of ARGOS-RAL in identifying canonical PDEs under various noise levels and sample sizes, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy and non-uniformly distributed data. We also test the algorithm's performance on datasets consisting solely of random noise to simulate scenarios with severely compromised data quality. Our results show that ARGOS-RAL effectively and reliably identifies the underlying PDEs from data, outperforming the sequential threshold ridge regression method in most cases.

        <tr id="Identifying Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) from measurement data requires both fitting the dynamics and assimilating, either implicitly or explicitly, the measurement data. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method involves a derivative estimation step (and optionally, smoothing) and a sparse regression step on a library of candidate ODE terms. Kalman smoothing is a classical framework for assimilating the measurement data with known noise statistics. Previously, derivatives in SINDy and its python package, pysindy, had been estimated by finite difference, L1 total variation minimization, or local filters like Savitzky-Golay. In contrast, Kalman allows discovering ODEs that best recreate the essential dynamics in simulation, even in cases when it does not perform as well at recovering coefficients, as measured by their F1 score and mean absolute error. We have incorporated Kalman smoothing, along with hyperparameter optimization, into the existing pysindy architecture, allowing for rapid adoption of the method. Numerical experiments on a number of dynamical systems show Kalman smoothing to be the most amenable to parameter selection and best at preserving problem structure in the presence of noise.">

However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization.

        <tr id="Estimating governing equations from observed time-series data is crucial for understanding dynamical systems. From the perspective of system comprehension, the demand for accurate estimation and interpretable results has been particularly emphasized. Herein, we propose a novel data-driven method for estimating the governing equations of dynamical systems based on machine learning with high accuracy and interpretability. The proposed method enhances the estimation accuracy for dynamical systems using sparse modeling by incorporating physical constraints derived from Hamiltonian mechanics. Unlike conventional approaches used for estimating governing equations for dynamical systems, we employ a sparse representation of Hamiltonian, allowing for the estimation. Using noisy observational data, the proposed method demonstrates a capability to achieve accurate parameter estimation and extraction of essential nonlinear terms. In addition, it is shown that estimations based on energy conservation principles exhibit superior accuracy in long-term predictions. These results collectively indicate that the proposed method accurately estimates dynamical systems while maintaining interpretability.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modelling and scientific machine learning have been responsible for significant advances in determining suitable models to describe data. Within dynamical systems, neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where the system equations are set to be governed by a neural network, have become a popular tool for this challenge in recent years. However, less emphasis has been placed on systems that are only partially-observed. In this work, we employ a hybrid neural ODE structure, where the system equations are governed by a combination of a neural network and domain-specific knowledge, together with symbolic regression (SR), to learn governing equations of partially-observed dynamical systems. We test this approach on two case studies: A 3-dimensional model of the Lotka-Volterra system and a 5-dimensional model of the Lorenz system. We demonstrate that the method is capable of successfully learning the true underlying governing equations of unobserved states within these systems, with robustness to measurement noise.">

        <tr id="Observed data from a dynamic system can be assimilated into a predictive model by means of Kalman filters. Nonlinear extensions of the Kalman filter, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), are required to enable the joint estimation of (possibly nonlinear) system dynamics and of input parameters. To construct the evolution model used in the prediction phase of the EKF, we propose to rely on the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). The numerical integration of a SINDy model leads to great computational savings compared to alternate strategies based on, e.g., finite elements. Indeed, SINDy allows for the immediate definition of the Jacobian matrices required by the EKF to identify system dynamics and properties, a derivation that is usually extremely involved with physical models. As a result, combining the EKF with SINDy provides a computationally efficient, easy-to-apply approach for the identification of nonlinear systems, capable of robust operation even outside the range of training of SINDy. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we address the identification of a linear non-autonomous system consisting of a shear building model excited by real seismograms, and the identification of a partially observed nonlinear system. The challenge arising from applying SINDy when the system state is not accessible has been relieved by means of time-delay embedding. The great accuracy and the small uncertainty associated with the state identification, where the state has been augmented to include system properties, underscores the great potential of the proposed strategy, paving the way for the development of predictive digital twins in different fields.">

In previous work, we combined genetic algorithm (GA) and machine learning to present a data-driven method for discovering a wave equation. Although it managed to utilize the data to discover the two-dimensional (x,z) acoustic constant-density wave equation u_tt=v^2(u_xx+u_zz) (subscripts of the wavefield, u, are second derivatives in time and space) in a homogeneous medium, it did not provide the complete equation form, where the velocity term is represented by a coefficient rather than directly given by v^2. In this work, we redesign the framework, encoding both velocity information and candidate functional terms simultaneously. Thus, we use GA to simultaneously evolve the candidate functional and coefficient terms in the library. Also, we consider here the physics rationality and interpretability in the randomly generated potential wave equations, by ensuring that both-hand sides of the equation maintain balance in their physical units. We demonstrate this redesigned framework using the acoustic wave equation as an example, showing its ability to produce physically reasonable expressions of wave equations from noisy and sparsely observed data in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media. Also, we demonstrate that our method can effectively discover wave equations from a more realistic observation scenario.">

        <tr id="A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA). In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems. The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible. Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy. This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills. With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty. Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems. Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.">

Existing studies primarily focus on uncovering equations that govern nonlinear dynamics based on direct measurement of the system states (e.g., trajectories). Limited efforts have been placed on distilling governing laws of dynamics directly from videos for moving targets in a 3D space. To this end, we propose a vision-based approach to automatically uncover governing equations of nonlinear dynamics for 3D moving targets via raw videos recorded by a set of cameras. The approach is composed of three key blocks: (1) a target tracking module that extracts plane pixel motions of the moving target in each video, (2) a Rodrigues' rotation formula-based coordinate transformation learning module that reconstructs the 3D coordinates with respect to a predefined reference point, and (3) a spline-enhanced library-based sparse regressor that uncovers the underlying governing law of dynamics. This framework is capable of effectively handling the challenges associated with measurement data, e.g., noise in the video, imprecise tracking of the target that causes data missing, etc. The efficacy of our method has been demonstrated through multiple sets of synthetic videos considering different nonlinear dynamics.">

In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.">

The extracted model is used together with a deep reinforcement learning network that learns the optimal stepwise actions to predict future states of the original nonlinear system. Our estimator is also adaptive to a diffeomorphic transformation of the nonlinear system which enables transfer learning to compute state estimates of the transformed system without relearning from scratch.">

SST is strongly affected by fine balances between forces and becomes more anisotropic in time for decaying cases. Moreover, there is a limited understanding of the physical phenomena described by some of the terms in the URANS equations. Rather than attempting to model each term separately, it is attractive to explore the capability of machine learning to model groups of terms, i.e., to directly model the force balances. We consider decaying SST which are homogeneous and stably stratified by a uniform density gradient, enabling dimensionality reduction. We consider two time-series ML models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE). Both models perform accurately and are numerically stable in a posteriori tests. Furthermore, we explore the data requirements of the ML models by extracting physically relevant timescales of the complex system. We find that the ratio of the timescales of the minimum information required by the ML models to accurately capture the dynamics of the SST corresponds to the Reynolds number of the flow. The current framework provides the backbone to explore the capability of such models to capture the dynamics of higher-dimensional complex SST flows.">

However, the discovery of governing equations from sparse data with high noise is still very challenging due to the difficulty of derivatives computation and the disturbance of noise. Moreover, the selection principles for the candidate library to meet physical laws need to be further studied. The invariance is one of the fundamental laws for governing equations. In this study, we propose an invariance constrained deep learning network (ICNet) for the discovery of PDEs. Considering that temporal and spatial translation invariance (Galilean invariance) is a fundamental property of physical laws, we filter the candidates that cannot meet the requirement of the Galilean transformations. Subsequently, we embedded the fixed and possible terms into the loss function of neural network, significantly countering the effect of sparse data with high noise. Then, by filtering out redundant terms without fixing learnable parameters during the training process, the governing equations discovered by the ICNet method can effectively approximate the real governing equations. We select the one-dimensional (1D) Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, the two-dimensional (2D) Burgers equation, the equation of two-dimensional channel flow over an obstacle, and the equation of three-dimensional (3D) intracranial aneurysm as examples to verify the superiority of the ICNet for fluid mechanics. Furthermore, we extend similar invariance methods to the discovery of wave equation (Lorentz Invariance) and verify it through single and coupled Klein–Gordon equation. The results show that the ICNet method with physical constraints exhibits excellent performance in governing equations discovery from sparse and noisy data.">

        <tr id="Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that linearize nonlinear dynamical systems, facilitating the study of their spectral properties and enabling the prediction of the time evolution of observable quantities. Recent methods have aimed to approximate Koopman operators while preserving key structures. However, approximating Koopman operators typically requires a dictionary of observables to capture the system's behavior in a finite-dimensional subspace. The selection of these functions is often heuristic, may result in the loss of spectral information, and can severely complicate structure preservation. This paper introduces Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition (MultDMD), which enforces the multiplicative structure inherent in the Koopman operator within its finite-dimensional approximation. Leveraging this multiplicative property, we guide the selection of observables and define a constrained optimization problem for the matrix approximation, which can be efficiently solved. MultDMD presents a structured approach to finite-dimensional approximations and can more accurately reflect the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We elaborate on the theoretical framework of MultDMD, detailing its formulation, optimization strategy, and convergence properties. The efficacy of MultDMD is demonstrated through several examples, including the nonlinear pendulum, the Lorenz system, and fluid dynamics data, where we demonstrate its remarkable robustness to noise.">

        <tr id="Identifying latent interactions within complex systems is key to unlocking deeper insights into their operational dynamics, including how their elements affect each other and contribute to the overall system behavior. For instance, in neuroscience, discovering neuron-to-neuron interactions is essential for understanding brain function; in ecology, recognizing the interactions among populations is key for understanding complex ecosystems. Such systems, often modeled as dynamical systems, typically exhibit noisy high-dimensional and non-stationary temporal behavior that renders their identification challenging. Existing dynamical system identification methods often yield operators that accurately capture short-term behavior but fail to predict long-term trends, suggesting an incomplete capture of the underlying process. Methods that consider extended forecasts (e.g., recurrent neural networks) lack explicit representations of element-wise interactions and require substantial training data, thereby failing to capture interpretable network operators. Here we introduce Lookahead-driven Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability (LINOCS), a robust learning procedure for identifying hidden dynamical interactions in noisy time-series data. LINOCS integrates several multi-step predictions with adaptive weights during training to recover dynamical operators that can yield accurate long-term predictions. We demonstrate LINOCS' ability to recover the ground truth dynamical operators underlying synthetic time-series data for multiple dynamical systems models (including linear, piece-wise linear, time-changing linear systems' decomposition, and regularized linear time-varying systems) as well as its capability to produce meaningful operators with robust reconstructions through various real-world examples.">

        <tr id="Linearity of Koopman operators and simplicity of their estimators coupled with model-reduction capabilities has lead to their great popularity in applications for learning dynamical systems. While nonparametric Koopman operator learning in infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is well understood for autonomous systems, its control system analogues are largely unexplored. Addressing systems with control inputs in a principled manner is crucial for fully data-driven learning of controllers, especially since existing approaches commonly resort to representational heuristics or parametric models of limited expressiveness and scalability. We address the aforementioned challenge by proposing a universal framework via control-affine reproducing kernels that enables direct estimation of a single operator even for control systems. The proposed approach, called control-Koopman operator regression (cKOR), is thus completely analogous to Koopman operator regression of the autonomous case. First in the literature, we present a nonparametric framework for learning Koopman operator representations of nonlinear control-affine systems that does not suffer from the curse of control input dimensionality. This allows for reformulating the infinite-dimensional learning problem in a finite-dimensional space based solely on data without apriori loss of precision due to a restriction to a finite span of functions or inputs as in other approaches. For enabling applications to large-scale control systems, we also enhance the scalability of control-Koopman operator estimators by leveraging random projections (sketching). The efficacy of our novel cKOR approach is demonstrated on both forecasting and control tasks.">

Conventionally, adjoint solvers need to be implemented by differentiating computational models, which can be a cumbersome task and is code-specific. To propose an adjoint solver that is not code-specific, we develop a data-driven strategy. We demonstrate its application on the computation of gradients of long-time averages of chaotic flows. First, we deploy a parameter-aware echo state network (ESN) to accurately forecast and simulate the dynamics of a dynamical system for a range of system's parameters. Second, we derive the adjoint of the parameter-aware ESN. Finally, we combine the parameter-aware ESN with its adjoint version to compute the sensitivities to the system parameters. We showcase the method on a prototypical chaotic system. Because adjoint sensitivities in chaotic regimes diverge for long integration times, we analyse the application of ensemble adjoint method to the ESN. We find that the adjoint sensitivities obtained from the ESN match closely with the original system. This work opens possibilities for sensitivity analysis without code-specific adjoint solvers.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modelling techniques provide a method for deriving models of dynamical systems directly from complicated data streams. However, tracking and forecasting such data streams poses a significant challenge to most methods, as they assume the underlying process and model does not change over time. In this paper, we apply one such data-driven method, the Koopman autoencoder (KAE), to high-dimensional oscillatory data to generate a low-dimensional latent space and model, where the system's dynamics appear linear. This allows one to accurately track and forecast systems where the underlying model may change over time. States and the model in the reduced order latent space can then be efficiently updated as new data becomes available, using data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), in a technique we call the KAE EnKF. We demonstrate that this approach is able to effectively track and forecast time-varying, nonlinear dynamical systems in synthetic examples. We then apply the KAE EnKF to a video of a physical pendulum, and achieve a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. By generating effective latent space reconstructions, we find that we are able to construct accurate short-term forecasts and efficient adaptations to externally forced changes to the pendulum's frequency.">

This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go. NKDCD also utilizes sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights of the lag matrices, encouraging the model to select only the needed causal dependencies within the data. Through extensive testing on practically applicable datasets, it is shown that the NKDCD outperforms the existing nonlinear Granger causality discovery approaches.">

        <tr id="Symbolic Regression (SR) is a widely studied field of research that aims to infer symbolic expressions from data. A popular approach for SR is the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (\sindy) framework, which uses sparse regression to identify governing equations from data. This study introduces an enhanced method, Nested SINDy, that aims to increase the expressivity of the SINDy approach thanks to a nested structure. Indeed, traditional symbolic regression and system identification methods often fail with complex systems that cannot be easily described analytically. Nested SINDy builds on the SINDy framework by introducing additional layers before and after the core SINDy layer. This allows the method to identify symbolic representations for a wider range of systems, including those with compositions and products of functions. We demonstrate the ability of the Nested SINDy approach to accurately find symbolic expressions for simple systems, such as basic trigonometric functions, and sparse (false but accurate) analytical representations for more complex systems. Our results highlight Nested SINDy's potential as a tool for symbolic regression, surpassing the traditional SINDy approach in terms of expressivity. However, we also note the challenges in the optimization process for Nested SINDy and suggest future research directions, including the designing of a more robust methodology for the optimization process. This study proves that Nested SINDy can effectively discover symbolic representations of dynamical systems from data, offering new opportunities for understanding complex systems through data-driven methods.">

        <tr id="Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.">

Prevailing methods using a least square estimate of the B matrix may result in an erroneous input matrix, misinforming the controller about the structure of the input matrix in a lifted space. Here, a new method for constructing a Koopman model that comprises the exact input matrix B is presented. A set of state variables are introduced so that the control inputs are linearly involved in the dynamics of actuators. With these variables, a lifted linear model with the exact control matrix, called a Control-Coherent Koopman Model, is constructed by superposing control input terms, which are linear in local actuator dynamics, to the Koopman operator of the associated autonomous nonlinear system. The proposed method is applied to multi degree-of-freedom robotic arms and multi-cable manipulation systems. Model Predictive Control is applied to the former. It is demonstrated that the prevailing Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) using an approximate control matrix B does not provide a satisfactory result, while the Control-Coherent Koopman Model performs well with the correct B matrix.">

Instead of identifying and simulating a Koopman model to predict future outputs, we design a subspace predictive controller in the Koopman space. This allows us to learn the observables minimizing the multi-step output prediction error of the Koopman subspace predictor, preventing the propagation of prediction errors. To avoid losing feasibility of our predictive control scheme due to prediction errors, we compute a terminal cost and terminal set in the Koopman space and we obtain recursive feasibility guarantees through an interpolated initial state. As a third contribution, we introduce a novel regularization cost yielding input-to-state stability guarantees with respect to the prediction error for the resulting closed-loop system. The performance of the developed Koopman data-driven predictive control methodology is illustrated on a nonlinear benchmark example from the literature.">

Previous methods based on symbolic mathematics have achieved substantial advancements, but often require the design of implementation of complex algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically mining governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse equations in string form, and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. In the optimization phase, we propose two alternately iterated strategies to optimize generated equations collaboratively. The first strategy is to take LLMs as a black-box optimizer and achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy is to instruct LLMs to perform evolutionary operators for global search. Experiments are extensively conducted on both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Results demonstrate that our framework can discover effective equations to reveal the underlying physical laws under various nonlinear dynamic systems. Further comparisons are made with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating good stability and usability. Our framework substantially lowers the barriers to learning and applying equation discovery techniques, demonstrating the application potential of LLMs in the field of knowledge discovery.">

        <tr id="Data assimilation aims to estimate the states of a dynamical system by optimally combining sparse and noisy observations of the physical system with uncertain forecasts produced by a computational model. The states of many dynamical systems of interest obey nonlinear physical constraints, and the corresponding dynamics is confined to a certain sub-manifold of the state space. Standard data assimilation techniques applied to such systems yield posterior states lying outside the manifold, violating the physical constraints. This work focuses on particle flow filters which use stochastic differential equations to evolve state samples from a prior distribution to samples from an observation-informed posterior distribution. The variational Fokker-Planck (VFP) -- a generic particle flow filtering framework -- is extended to incorporate non-linear, equality state constraints in the analysis. To this end, two algorithmic approaches that modify the VFP stochastic differential equation are discussed: (i) VFPSTAB, to inexactly preserve constraints with the addition of a stabilizing drift term, and (ii) VFPDAE, to exactly preserve constraints by treating the VFP dynamics as a stochastic differential-algebraic equation (SDAE). Additionally, an implicit-explicit time integrator is developed to evolve the VFPDAE dynamics. The strength of the proposed approach for constraint preservation in data assimilation is demonstrated on three test problems: the double pendulum, Korteweg-de-Vries, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.">

        <tr id="The ability to automatically discover interpretable mathematical models from data could forever change how we model soft matter systems. For convex discovery problems with a unique global minimum, model discovery is well-established. It uses a classical top-down approach that first calculates a dense parameter vector, and then sparsifies the vector by gradually removing terms. For non-convex discovery problems with multiple local minima, this strategy is infeasible since the initial parameter vector is generally non-unique. Here we propose a novel bottom-up approach that starts with a sparse single-term vector, and then densifies the vector by systematically adding terms. Along the way, we discover models of gradually increasing complexity, a strategy that we call best-in-class modeling. To identify successful candidate terms, we reverse-engineer a library of sixteen functional building blocks that integrate a century of knowledge in material modeling with recent trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Yet, instead of solving the discrete combinatorial problem with 65,536 possible combinations of terms, best-in-class modeling starts with the best one-term model and iteratively repeats adding terms, until the objective function meets a user-defined convergence criterion. Strikingly, we achieve good convergence with only one or two terms. We illustrate the best-in-class one- and two-term models for a variety of soft matter systems including rubber, brain, artificial meat, skin, and arteries. Our discovered models display distinct and unexpected features for each family of materials, and suggest that best-in-class modeling is an efficient, robust, and easy-to-use strategy to discover the mechanical signatures of traditional and unconventional soft materials. We anticipate that our technology will generalize naturally to other classes of natural and man-made soft matter.">

Here, we frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in a complex foodweb lead to harder ill-conditioned problems, manifesting as slow modes on a nearly-degenerate solution landscape. Common dimensionality reduction methods precondition ecological dynamics, by isolating fast relaxation from slow solving timescales that exhibit transient chaos for harder problem instances. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using complexity bounds for constrained optimization.

This paper employs a greedy sampling approach based on the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method to identify the most informative samples in a dataset associated with a partial differential equation to estimate its parameters. Greedy samples are used to train a physics-informed neural network architecture which maps the nonlinear relation between spatio-temporal data and the measured values. To prove the impact of greedy samples on the training of the physics-informed neural network for parameter estimation of a partial differential equation, their performance is compared with random samples taken from the given dataset. Our simulation results show that for all considered partial differential equations, greedy samples outperform random samples, i.e., we can estimate parameters with a significantly lower number of samples while simultaneously reducing the relative estimation error. A Python package is also prepared to support different phases of the proposed algorithm, including data prepossessing, greedy sampling, neural network training, and comparison.">

In this study, we focus on the development of such metrics for viscoelastic fluid flows governed by a large class of linear and nonlinear stress models. To do this, we introduce a kernel function corresponding to a given viscoelastic stress model that implicitly embeds flowfield snapshots into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) whose squared norm equals the total mechanical energy. Working implicitly with lifted representations in the RKHS via the kernel function provides natural and unambiguous metrics for distances and angles between flowfields without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we present a solution to the preimage problem for our kernels, enabling accurate reconstruction of flowfields from their RKHS representations. Through numerical experiments on an unsteady viscoelastic lid-driven cavity flow, we demonstrate the utility of our kernels for extracting energetically-dominant coherent structures in viscoelastic flows across a range of Reynolds and Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, the features extracted by Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) of flowfield snapshots using our kernel functions yield reconstructions with superior accuracy in terms of mechanical energy compared to conventional methods such as ordinary Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with na\"ively-defined state vectors or KPCA with ad-hoc choices of kernel functions. Our findings underscore the importance of principled choices of metrics in both scientific and machine learning investigations of complex fluid systems.">

        <tr id="The meaningful problem of improving crane safety, reliability, and efficiency is extensively studied in the literature and targeted via various model-based control approaches. In recent years, crane data-driven modeling has attracted much attention compared to physics-based models, particularly due to its potential in real-time crane control applications, specifically in model predictive control. This paper proposes grammar-guided genetic programming with sparse regression (G3P-SR) to identify the nonlinear dynamics of an underactuated crane system. G3P-SR uses grammars to bias the search space and produces a fixed number of candidate model terms, while a local search method based on an l0-regularized regression results in a sparse solution, thereby also reducing model complexity as well as reducing the probability of overfitting. Identification is performed on experimental data obtained from a laboratory-scale overhead crane. The proposed method is compared with multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), NARX neural network, and Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy (TSF) ARX models in terms of model complexity, prediction accuracy, and sensitivity. The G3P-SR algorithm evolved a model with a maximum mean square error (MSE) of crane velocity and sway prediction of 1.1860 × 10−4 and 4.8531 × 10−4, respectively, in simulations for different testing data sets, showing better accuracy than the TSF ARX and MGGP models. Only the NARX neural network model with velocity and sway maximum MSEs of 1.4595 × 10−4 and 4.8571 × 10−4 achieves a similar accuracy or an even better one in some testing scenarios, but at the cost of increasing the total number of parameters to be estimated by over 300% and the number of output lags compared to the G3P-SR model. Moreover, the G3P-SR model is proven to be notably less sensitive, exhibiting the least deviation from the nominal trajectory for deviations in the payload mass by approximately a factor of 10.">

Each reduced order model is composed of a nonlinear encoder-regressor-decoder architecture and is equipped with an adaptive update strategy that adds robustness for extrapolation. In doing so, the proposed methodology leverages physics-based insights from high-fidelity solvers, thus establishing a physics-aware machine learning predictor. Using three strongly coupled FSI examples, this study demonstrates the improved convergence obtained with the new predictor and the overall computational speedup realized compared to classical approaches.">

        <tr id="In engineering, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamic systems from data contaminated by noise is both essential and complex. Established Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, used for the Bayesian identification of these systems, facilitate the quantification of uncertainty in the parameter identification process. A significant challenge in this context is the numerical integration of continuous-time ordinary differential equations (ODEs), crucial for aligning theoretical models with discretely sampled data. This integration introduces additional numerical uncertainty, a factor that is often over looked. To address this issue, the field of probabilistic numerics combines numerical methods, such as numerical integration, with probabilistic modeling to offer a more comprehensive analysis of total uncertainty. By retaining the accuracy of classical deterministic methods, these probabilistic approaches offer a deeper understanding of the uncertainty inherent in the inference process. This paper demonstrates the application of a probabilistic numerical method for solving ODEs in the joint parameter-state identification of nonlinear dynamic systems. The presented approach efficiently identifies latent states and system parameters from noisy measurements. Simultaneously incorporating probabilistic solutions to the ODE in the identification challenge. The methodology's primary advantage lies in its capability to produce posterior distributions over system parameters, thereby representing the inherent uncertainties in both the data and the identification process.">

        <tr id="Resolvent analysis provides a framework to predict coherent spatio-temporal structures of largest linear energy amplification, through a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the resolvent operator, obtained by linearizing the Navier--Stokes equations about a known turbulent mean velocity profile. Resolvent analysis utilizes a Fourier decomposition in time, which has thus-far limited its application to statistically-stationary or time-periodic flows. This work develops a variant of resolvent analysis applicable to time-evolving flows, and proposes a variant that identifies spatio-temporally sparse structures, applicable to either stationary or time-varying mean velocity profiles. Spatio-temporal resolvent analysis is formulated through the incorporation of the temporal dimension to the numerical domain via a discrete time-differentiation operator. Sparsity (which manifests in localisation) is achieved through the addition of an L1-norm penalisation term to the optimisation associated with the SVD. This modified optimization problem can be formulated as a nonlinear eigenproblem, and solved via an inverse power method. We first demonstrate the implementation of the sparse analysis on statistically-stationary turbulent channel flow, and demonstrate that the sparse variant can identify aspects of the physics not directly evident from standard resolvent analysis. This is followed by applying the sparse space-time formulation on systems that are time-varying: a time-periodic turbulent Stokes boundary layer, and then a turbulent channel flow with a sudden change in pressure gradient. We present results demonstrating how the sparsity-promoting variant can either change the quantitative structure of the leading space-time modes to increase their sparsity, or identify entirely different linear amplification mechanisms compared to non-sparse resolvent analysis.">

        <tr id="Modeling uncertainties pose a significant challenge in the development and deployment of model-based vehicle control systems. Most model- based automotive control systems require the use of a well estimated vehicle dynamics prediction model. The ability of first principles-based models to represent vehicle behavior becomes limited under complex scenarios due to underlying rigid physical assumptions. Additionally, the increasing complexity of these models to meet ever-increasing fidelity requirements presents challenges for obtaining analytical solutions as well as control design. Alternatively, deterministic data driven techniques including but not limited to deep neural networks, polynomial regression, Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) have been deployed for vehicle dynamics system identification and prediction. However, under real-world conditions which are often uncertain or time varying, including, but not limited to changing terrain and/or physical, a single time-invariant physics- based or parametric model may not accurately represent vehicle behavior resulting in sub-optimal controller performance. The previously mentioned data-driven system identification techniques, by virtue of being deterministic cannot express these uncertainties, leading to a need for multiple models, or a distribution of models to describe vehicle behavior. Gaussian Process Regression constitutes a cogent approach for capturing and expressing modeling uncertainties through a probability distribution. In this paper, we demonstrate Gaussian Process Regression as an able technique for modeling uncertain vehicle dynamics using a real-world vehicle dataset, acquired by performing benchmark maneuvers using a scaled vehicle observed by a motion-capture system. Using Gaussian Process Regression, we develop single-step as well as multi-step prediction models that are usable for reactive as well as predictive model-based control techniques.">

Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

Resorting only to classical methods to reliably model a quadrotor carrying a cable-slung load poses significant challenges. On the other hand, purely data-driven learning methods do not comply by design with the problem's physical constraints, especially in states that are not densely represented in training data. In this work, we explore the use of physics informed neural networks to learn an end-to-end model of the multirotor-slung-load system and, at a given time, estimate a sequence of the future system states. An LSTM encoder decoder with an attention mechanism is used to capture the dynamics of the system. To guarantee the cohesiveness between the multiple predicted states of the system, we propose the use of a physics-based term in the loss function, which includes a discretized physical model derived from first principles together with slack variables that allow for a small mismatch between expected and predicted values. To train the model, a dataset using a real-world quadrotor carrying a slung load was curated and is made available. Prediction results are presented and corroborate the feasibility of the approach.

        <tr id="Motion prediction is critical for autonomous off-road driving, however, it presents significantly more challenges than on-road driving because of the complex interaction between the vehicle and the terrain. Traditional physics-based approaches encounter difficulties in accurately modeling dynamic systems and external disturbance. In contrast, data-driven neural networks require extensive datasets and struggle with explicitly capturing the fundamental physical laws, which can easily lead to poor generalization. By merging the advantages of both methods, neuro-symbolic approaches present a promising direction. These methods embed physical laws into neural models, potentially significantly improving generalization capabilities. However, no prior works were evaluated in real-world settings for off-road driving. To bridge this gap, we present PhysORD, a neural-symbolic approach integrating the conservation law, i.e., the Euler-Lagrange equation, into data-driven neural models for motion prediction in off-road driving. Our experiments showed that PhysORD can accurately predict vehicle motion and tolerate external disturbance by modeling uncertainties. It outperforms existing methods both in accuracy and efficiency and demonstrates data-efficient learning and generalization ability in long-term prediction.">

        <tr id="Formulating dynamical models for physical phenomena is essential for understanding the interplay between the different mechanisms and predicting the evolution of physical states. However, a dynamical model alone is often insufficient to address these fundamental tasks, as it suffers from model errors and uncertainties. One common remedy is to rely on data assimilation, where the state estimate is updated with observations of the true system. Ensemble filters sequentially assimilate observations by updating a set of samples over time. They operate in two steps: a forecast step that propagates each sample through the dynamical model and an analysis step that updates the samples with incoming observations. For accurate and robust predictions of dynamical systems, discrete solutions must preserve their critical invariants. While modern numerical solvers satisfy these invariants, existing invariant-preserving analysis steps are limited to Gaussian settings and are often not compatible with classical regularization techniques of ensemble filters, e.g., inflation and covariance tapering. The present work focuses on preserving linear invariants, such as mass, stoichiometric balance of chemical species, and electrical charges. Using tools from measure transport theory (Spantini et al., 2022, SIAM Review), we introduce a generic class of nonlinear ensemble filters that automatically preserve desired linear invariants in non-Gaussian filtering problems. By specializing this framework to the Gaussian setting, we recover a constrained formulation of the Kalman filter. Then, we show how to combine existing regularization techniques for the ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994, J. Geophys. Res.) with the preservation of the linear invariants. Finally, we assess the benefits of preserving linear invariants for the ensemble Kalman filter and nonlinear ensemble filters.">

Building on switching linear dynamical systems, we develop a new model that extends the switching linear dynamical systems for better discovering these dynamical modes. In the proposed model, the linear dynamics of latent variables can be described by a higher-order vector autoregressive process, which makes it feasible to evaluate the higher-order dependency relationships in the dynamics. In addition, the transition of switching states is determined by a stick-breaking logistic regression, overcoming the limitation of a restricted geometric state duration and recovering the symmetric dependency between the switching states and the latent variables from asymmetric relationships. Furthermore, logistic regression evidence potentials can appear as conditionally Gaussian potentials by utilizing the Pólya-gamma augmentation strategy. Filtering and smoothing algorithms and Bayesian inference for parameter learning in the proposed model are presented. The utility and versatility of the proposed model are demonstrated on synthetic data and public functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our model improves the current methods for learning the switching linear dynamical modes, which will facilitate the identification and assessment of the dynamics of complex systems.">

This challenge necessitates new mathematical and algorithmic tools that enable adaptation and zero-shot transfer. To this end, we leverage the theory of function encoders, which enables zero-shot transfer by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical principles of Hilbert spaces. Using this theory, we first present a method for learning a space of dynamics spanned by a set of neural ODE basis functions. After training, the proposed approach can rapidly identify dynamics in the learned space using an efficient inner product calculation. Critically, this calculation requires no gradient calculations or retraining during the online phase. This method enables zero-shot transfer for autonomous systems at runtime and opens the door for a new class of adaptable control algorithms. We demonstrate state-of-the-art system modeling accuracy for two MuJoCo robot environments and show that the learned models can be used for more efficient MPC control of a quadrotor.">

The unifying perspective leads to novel stability and a posteriori error analysis results that provide insights into theoretical and numerical aspects that are inherent to either OtD or DtO schemes such as the tangent space collapse phenomenon, which is a form of over-fitting.

The challenge remains in providing estimations for transitional properties pertaining to the system's vector fields based on discrete-time observations. To retrieve such infinitesimal system transition information, leveraging the structure of Koopman operator learning, current literature focuses on developing techniques free of time derivatives through the use of the Koopman operator logarithm. However, the soundness of these methods has so far been demonstrated only for maintaining effectiveness within a restrictive function space, together with knowledge of the operator spectrum properties. To better adapt to the practical applications in learning and control of unknown systems, we propose a logarithm-free technique for learning the infinitesimal generator without disrupting the Koopman operator learning framework. This approach claims compatibility with other system verification tools using the same set of training data. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness in applications of system identification and stability prediction.">

In this paper, we discuss a systematic approach to constructing neural architectures for modeling a subclass of dynamical systems, namely, Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. We use a variant of continuous-time neural networks in which the output of each neuron evolves continuously as a solution of a first-order or second-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Instead of deriving the network architecture and parameters from data, we propose a gradient-free algorithm to compute sparse architecture and network parameters directly from the given LTI system, leveraging its properties. We bring forth a novel neural architecture paradigm featuring horizontal hidden layers and provide insights into why employing conventional neural architectures with vertical hidden layers may not be favorable. We also provide an upper bound on the numerical errors of our neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the high accuracy of our constructed networks on three numerical examples.">

        <tr id="Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

        <tr id="We present a computational method for open-loop minimum-norm control synthesis for fixed-endpoint transfer of bilinear ensemble systems that are indexed by two continuously varying parameters. We suppose that one ensemble parameter scales the homogeneous, linear part of the dynamics, and the second parameter scales the effect of the applied control inputs on the inhomogeneous, bilinear dynamics. This class of dynamical systems is motivated by robust quantum control pulse synthesis, where the ensemble parameters correspond to uncertainty in the free Hamiltonian and inhomogeneity in the control Hamiltonian, respectively. Our computational method is based on polynomial approximation of the ensemble state in parameter space and discretization of the evolution equations in the time domain using a product of matrix exponentials corresponding to zero-order hold controls over the time intervals. The dynamics are successively linearized about control and trajectory iterates to formulate a sequence of quadratic programs for computing perturbations to the control that successively improve the objective until the iteration converges. We use a two-stage computation to first ensure transfer to the desired terminal state, and then minimize the norm of the control function. The method is demonstrated for the canonical uniform transfer problem for the Bloch system that appears in nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as the matter-wave splitting problem for the Raman-Nath system that appears in ultra-cold atom interferometry.">

        <tr id="The brain produces diverse functions, from perceiving sounds to producing arm reaches, through the collective activity of populations of many neurons. Determining if and how the features of these exogenous variables (e.g., sound frequency, reach angle) are reflected in population neural activity is important for understanding how the brain operates. Often, high-dimensional neural population activity is confined to low-dimensional latent spaces. However, many current methods fail to extract latent spaces that are clearly structured by exogenous variables. This has contributed to a debate about whether or not brains should be thought of as dynamical systems or representational systems. Here, we developed a new latent process Bayesian regression framework, the orthogonal stochastic linear mixing model (OSLMM) which introduces an orthogonality constraint amongst time-varying mixture coefficients, and provide Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedures. We demonstrate superior performance of OSLMM on latent trajectory recovery in synthetic experiments and show superior computational efficiency and prediction performance on several real-world benchmark data sets. We primarily focus on demonstrating the utility of OSLMM in two neural data sets: μECoG recordings from rat auditory cortex during presentation of pure tones and multi-single unit recordings form monkey motor cortex during complex arm reaching. We show that OSLMM achieves superior or comparable predictive accuracy of neural data and decoding of external variables (e.g., reach velocity). Most importantly, in both experimental contexts, we demonstrate that OSLMM latent trajectories directly reflect features of the sounds and reaches, demonstrating that neural dynamics are structured by neural representations. Together, these results demonstrate that OSLMM will be useful for the analysis of diverse, large-scale biological time-series datasets.">

Taking the viscous Burgers equation as an example, this paper constructs a Convolutional Autoencoder-Reservoir Computing-Normalizing Flow algorithm framework, where the Convolutional Autoencoder is used to construct latent space representations, and the Reservoir Computing-Normalizing Flow framework is used to characterize the evolution of latent state variables.

        <tr id="Given a time-series of noisy measured outputs of a dynamical system z[k], k=1...N, the Identifying Regulation with Adversarial Surrogates (IRAS) algorithm aims to find a non-trivial first integral of the system, namely, a scalar function g() such that g(z[i]) = g(z[j]), for all i,j. IRAS has been suggested recently and was used successfully in several learning tasks in models from biology and physics. Here, we give the first rigorous analysis of this algorithm in a specific setting. We assume that the observations admit a linear first integral and that they are contaminated by Gaussian noise. We show that in this case the IRAS iterations are closely related to the self-consistent-field (SCF) iterations for solving a generalized Rayleigh quotient minimization problem. Using this approach, we derive several sufficient conditions guaranteeing local convergence of IRAS to the correct first integral.">

        <tr id="A promising step from linear towards nonlinear data-driven control is via the design of controllers for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems, which are linear systems whose parameters are varying along a measurable scheduling signal. However, the interplay between uncertainty arising from corrupted data and the parameter-varying nature of these systems impacts the stability analysis, and limits the generalization of well-understood data-driven methods for linear time-invariant systems. In this work, we decouple this interplay using a recently developed variant of the Fundamental Lemma for LPV systems and the viewpoint of data-informativity, in combination with biquadratic Lyapunov forms. Together, these allow us to develop novel linear matrix inequality conditions for the existence of scheduling-dependent Lyapunov functions, incorporating the intrinsic nonlinearity. Appealingly, these results are stated purely in terms of the collected data and bounds on the noise, and they are computationally favorable to check.">

        <tr id="The motivation behind this study is to overcome the complex mathematical formulation and time-consuming nature of traditional numerical methods used in solving differential equations. It seeks an alternative approach for more efficient and simplified solutions. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is utilized to understand the intricate correlations between the oscillator’s variables and to precisely capture their dynamics by being trained on a dataset of known oscillator behaviors. In this work, we discuss the main challenge of predicting the behavior of oscillators without depending on complex strategies or time-consuming simulations. The present work proposes a favorable modified form of neural structure to improve the strategy for simulating linear and nonlinear harmonic oscillators from mechanical systems by formulating an ANN as a DNN via an appropriate oscillating activation function. The proposed methodology provides the solutions of linear and nonlinear differential equations (DEs) in differentiable form and is a more accurate approximation as compared to the traditional numerical method. The Van der Pol equation with parametric damping and the Mathieu equation are adopted as illustrations. Experimental analysis shows that our proposed scheme outperforms other numerical methods in terms of accuracy and computational cost. We provide a comparative analysis of the outcomes obtained through our proposed approach and those derived from the LSODA algorithm, utilizing numerical techniques, Adams–Bashforth, and the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF).

        <tr id="Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning (SciML) combines the powerful predictive power of SciML with methods for quantifying the reliability of the learned models. However, two major challenges remain: limited interpretability and expensive training procedures. We provide a new interpretation for UQ problems by establishing a new theoretical connection between some Bayesian inference problems arising in SciML and viscous Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs). Namely, we show that the posterior mean and covariance can be recovered from the spatial gradient and Hessian of the solution to a viscous HJ PDE. As a first exploration of this connection, we specialize to Bayesian inference problems with linear models, Gaussian likelihoods, and Gaussian priors. In this case, the associated viscous HJ PDEs can be solved using Riccati ODEs, and we develop a new Riccati-based methodology that provides computational advantages when continuously updating the model predictions. Specifically, our Riccati-based approach can efficiently add or remove data points to the training set invariant to the order of the data and continuously tune hyperparameters. Moreover, neither update requires retraining on or access to previously incorporated data. We provide several examples from SciML involving noisy data and \textit{epistemic uncertainty} to illustrate the potential advantages of our approach. In particular, this approach's amenability to data streaming applications demonstrates its potential for real-time inferences, which, in turn, allows for applications in which the predicted uncertainty is used to dynamically alter the learning process.">

        <tr id="Aggressive and accurate control of complex dynamical systems, such as soft robots, is especially challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining an accurate and tractable model for realtime control. Learned dynamic models are incredibly useful because they do not require derivation of an analytical model, they can represent complex, nonlinear behavior directly from data, and they can be evaluated quickly on graphics-processing units (GPUs). In this paper, we present an open-source Python library to further current research in model-based control of soft robot systems. Our library for Modeling of Learned Dynamics (MoLDy), is designed to generate learned forward models of complex systems through a data-driven approach to hyperparameter optimization and learned model training. Included in the MoLDy library, we present an open-source version of NEMPC (Nonlinear Evo-lutionary Model Predictive Control), a previously published control algorithm validated on soft robots. We demonstrate the ability of MoLDy and NEMPC to accurately perform model-based control on a physical pneumatic continuum joint. We also present a benchmarking study on the effect of the loss metric used in model training on control performance. The results of this paper serve to guide other researchers in creating learned dynamic models of novel systems and using them in closed-loop control tasks.">

These models incorporate domain-specific knowledge as soft constraints on a loss function and use machine learning techniques to train the model. Although PINN models have shown promising results for simple problems, they are prone to failure when moderate level of complexities are added to the problems. We demonstrate that the existing baseline models, in particular PINN and evolutionary sampling (Evo), are unable to capture the solution to differential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators when the imposed initial condition is non-trivial. We then propose a promising solution to address these types of failure modes. This approach involves coupling Curriculum learning with the baseline models, where the network first trains on PDEs with simple initial conditions and is progressively exposed to more complex initial conditions. Our results show that we can reduce the error by 1 – 2 orders of magnitude with our proposed method compared to regular PINN and Evo.">

        <tr id="We present an algorithm for constructing efficient surrogate frequency‐domain models of (nonlinear) parametric dynamical systems in a non‐intrusive way. To capture the dependence of the underlying system on frequency and parameters, our proposed approach combines rational approximation and smooth interpolation. In the approximation effort, locally adaptive sparse grids are applied to effectively explore the parameter domain even if the number of parameters is modest or high. Adaptivity is also employed to build rational approximations that efficiently capture the frequency dependence of the problem. These two features enable our method to build surrogate models that achieve a user‐prescribed approximation accuracy, without wasting resources in “oversampling” the frequency and parameter domains. Thanks to its non‐intrusiveness, our proposed method, as opposed to projection‐based techniques for model order reduction, can be applied regardless of the complexity of the underlying physical model. Notably, our algorithm for adaptive sampling can be used even when prior knowledge of the problem structure is not available. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it in the study of an aerodynamic bearing. Our method allows us to build surrogate models that adequately identify the bearing's behavior with respect to both design and operational parameters, while still achieving significant speedups.">

        <tr id="Koopman operator theory is a kind of data-driven modelling approach that accurately captures the nonlinearities of mechatronic systems such as vehicles against physics-based methods. However, the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator is impossible to implement in real-world applications. To approximate the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator through collection dataset rather than manual trial and error, we adopt deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract basis functions by offline training and map the nonlinearities of vehicle planar dynamics into a linear form in the lifted space. Besides, the effects of the dimensions of basis functions on the model accuracy are explored. Further, the extended state observer (ESO) is introduced to online estimate the total disturbance in the lifted space and compensate for the modelling errors and residuals of the learned deep Koopman operator (DK) while also improving its generalization. Then, the proposed model is applied to predict vehicle states within prediction horizons and later formulates the constrained finite-time optimization problem of model predictive control (MPC), i.e., ESO-DKMPC. In terms of the trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles, the ESO-DKMPC generates the wheel steering angle to govern lateral motions based on the decoupling control structure. The various conditions under the double-lane change scenarios are built on the CarSim/Simulink co-simulation platform, and extensive comparisons are conducted with the linear MPC (LMPC) and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) informed by the physics-based model. The results indicate that the proposed ESO-DKMPC has better tracking performance and moderate efficacy both within linear and nonlinear regions.">

The issue gets worse when the changing parameters are unobserved, i.e., their value or influence is not directly measurable when collecting data. We introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a framework that encodes said unobserved parameters in a latent context vector as input to a vector field. NCFs leverage differentiability of the vector field with respect to the parameters, along with first-order Taylor expansion to allow any context vector to influence trajectories from other parameters. We validate our method and compare it to established Multi-Task and Meta-Learning alternatives, showing competitive performance in mean squared error for in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluation on the Lotka-Volterra, Glycolytic Oscillator, and Gray-Scott problems.

Next to convergence guarantees, the method allows for quantification of model uncertainty, which can provide a basis of adaptive sampling techniques. We provide efficient uncertainty quantification of any observable that is linear in the Lagrangian, including of Hamiltonian functions (energy) and symplectic structures, which is of interest in the context of system identification. The article overcomes major practical and theoretical difficulties related to the ill-posedness of the identification task of (discrete) Lagrangians through a careful design of geometric regularisation strategies and through an exploit of a relation to convex minimisation problems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.">

        <tr id="Although the two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations (2QGE) are a simplified model for the dynamics of a stratified, wind-driven ocean, their numerical simulation is still plagued by the need for high resolution to capture the full spectrum of turbulent scales. Since such high resolution would lead to unreasonable computational times, it is typical to resort to coarse low-resolution meshes combined with the so-called eddy viscosity parameterization to account for the diffusion mechanisms that are not captured due to mesh under-resolution. We propose to enable the use of further coarsened meshes by adding a (linear or nonlinear) differential low-pass to the 2QGE, without changing the eddy viscosity coefficient. While the linear filter introduces constant (additional) artificial viscosity everywhere in the domain, the nonlinear filter relies on an indicator function to determine where and how much artificial viscosity is needed. Through several numerical results for a double-gyre wind forcing benchmark, we show that with the nonlinear filter we obtain accurate results with very coarse meshes, thereby drastically reducing the computational time (speed up ranging from 30 to 300).">

        <tr id="Accurate prediction of electricity day-ahead prices is essential in competitive electricity markets. Although stationary electricity-price forecasting techniques have received considerable attention, research on non-stationary methods is comparatively scarce, despite the common prevalence of non-stationary features in electricity markets. Specifically, existing non-stationary techniques will often aim to address individual non-stationary features in isolation, leaving aside the exploration of concurrent multiple non-stationary effects. Our overarching objective here is the formulation of a framework to systematically model and forecast non-stationary electricity-price time series, encompassing the broader scope of non-stationary behavior. For this purpose, we develop a data-driven model that combines an N-dimensional Langevin equation (LE) with a neural-ordinary differential equation (NODE). The LE captures fine-grained details of the electricity-price behavior in stationary regimes but is inadequate for non-stationary conditions. To overcome this inherent limitation, we adopt a NODE approach to learn, and at the same time predict, the difference between the actual electricity-price time series and the simulated price trajectories generated by the LE. By learning this difference, the NODE reconstructs the non-stationary components of the time series that the LE is not able to capture. We exemplify the effectiveness of our framework using the Spanish electricity day-ahead market as a prototypical case study. Our findings reveal that the NODE nicely complements the LE, providing a comprehensive strategy to tackle both stationary and non-stationary electricity-price behavior. The framework's dependability and robustness is demonstrated through different non-stationary scenarios by comparing it against a range of basic naïve methods.">

        <tr id="Standard approaches to controlling dynamical systems involve biologically implausible steps such as backpropagation of errors or intermediate model-based system representations. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that"imperfect"feedback of errors during training can yield test performance that is similar to using full backpropagated errors, provided that the two error signals are at least somewhat aligned. Inspired by such methods, we introduce an iterative, spatiotemporally local protocol to learn driving forces and control non-equilibrium dynamical systems using imperfect feedback signals. We present numerical experiments and theoretical justification for several examples. For systems in conservative force fields that are driven by external time-dependent protocols, our update rules resemble a dynamical version of contrastive divergence. We appeal to linear response theory to establish that our imperfect update rules are locally convergent for these conservative systems. For systems evolving under non-conservative dynamics, we derive a new theoretical result that makes possible the control of non-equilibrium steady-state probabilities through simple local update rules. Finally, we show that similar local update rules can also solve dynamical control problems for non-conservative systems, and we illustrate this in the non-trivial example of active nematics. Our updates allow learning spatiotemporal activity fields that pull topological defects along desired trajectories in the active nematic fluid. These imperfect feedback methods are information efficient and in principle biologically plausible, and they can help extend recent methods of decentralized training for physical materials into dynamical settings.">

        <tr id="We discuss Hamiltonian and Liouvillian learning for analog quantum simulation from non-equilibrium quench dynamics in the limit of weakly dissipative many-body systems. We present various strategies to learn the operator content of the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad operators of the Liouvillian. We compare different ans\"atze based on an experimentally accessible"learning error"which we consider as a function of the number of runs of the experiment. Initially, the learning error decreasing with the inverse square root of the number of runs, as the error in the reconstructed parameters is dominated by shot noise. Eventually the learning error remains constant, allowing us to recognize missing ansatz terms. A central aspect of our approach is to (re-)parametrize ans\"atze by introducing and varying the dependencies between parameters. This allows us to identify the relevant parameters of the system, thereby reducing the complexity of the learning task. Importantly, this (re-)parametrization relies solely on classical post-processing, which is compelling given the finite amount of data available from experiments. A distinguishing feature of our approach is the possibility to learn the Hamiltonian, without the necessity of learning the complete Liouvillian, thus further reducing the complexity of the learning task. We illustrate our method with two, experimentally relevant, spin models.">

We describe the approaches in the specific context of solutions to SPDEs describing the evolution of fluid particles, sometimes called inviscid vortex methods. The methods are tested in an idealised setting in which the reference data is a known realisation of the parameterised SPDE, and also using a forecast verification metric known as the Continuous Rank Probability Score (CRPS).">

We propose a specific neural network (NN) architecture that yields a hybrid system with piecewise-affine dynamics that is differentiable with respect to the network's parameters, thereby enabling the use of derivative-based training procedures. We show that a careful choice of our NN's weights produces a hybrid system model with structural properties that are highly favourable when used as part of a finite horizon optimal control problem (OCP). Specifically, we show that optimal solutions with strong local optimality guarantees can be computed via nonlinear programming, in contrast to classical OCPs for general hybrid systems which typically require mixed-integer optimization. In addition to being well-suited for optimal control design, numerical simulations illustrate that our NN-based technique enjoys very similar performance to state-of-the-art system identification methodologies for hybrid systems and it is competitive on nonlinear benchmarks.">

        <tr id="In data assimilation, an ensemble provides a nonintrusive way to evolve a probability density described by a nonlinear prediction model. Although a large ensemble size is required for statistical accuracy, the ensemble size is typically limited to a small number due to the computational cost of running the prediction model, which leads to a sampling error. Several methods, such as localization, exist to mitigate the sampling error, often requiring problem-dependent fine-tuning and design. This work introduces another sampling error mitigation method using a smoothness constraint in the Fourier space. In particular, this work smoothes out the spectrum of the system to increase the stability and accuracy even under a small ensemble size. The efficacy of the new idea is validated through a suite of stringent test problems, including Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky turbulence models.">

In this space, general state constraints for continuous and impulsive control problems are encoded as linear constraints on the native overparameterized variables. This framework is enabled by nonlinear expansion in the vicinity of a reference in terms of fundamental solutions and a minimal nonlinear basis of mixed monomials in problem initial conditions. The former can be computed using state transition tensors, differential algebra, or analytic approaches, and the latter is computed analytically. Nonlinear guidance schemes are proposed taking advantage of this framework, including a successive convex programming scheme for delta-V minimizing trajectory optimization.

The DC framework differs from traditional Bayesian approaches due to the incorporation of the push-forward of an initial density, which performs selective regularization in parameter directions not informed by the data in the resulting updated density. This extends a previous study that included the linear Gaussian theory within the DC framework and introduced the maximal updated density (MUD) estimate as an alternative to both least squares and maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates. In this work, we introduce algorithms for operational settings of MUD estimation in real or near-real time where spatio-temporal datasets arrive in packets to provide updated estimates of parameters and identify potential parameter drift. Computational diagnostics within the DC framework prove critical for evaluating (1) the quality of the DC update and MUD estimate and (2) the detection of parameter value drift. The algorithms are applied to estimate (1) wind drag parameters in a high-fidelity storm surge model, (2) thermal diffusivity field for a heat conductivity problem, and (3) changing infection and incubation rates of an epidemiological model.">

However, the size of the optimization problem in DeePC grows linearly with respect to the data size, which prohibits its application due to high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation of DeePC, whose size is invariant with respect to the amount of data collected, via differentiable convex programming. Specifically, the optimization problem in DeePC is decomposed into two parts: a control objective and a scoring function that evaluates the likelihood of a guessed I/O sequence, the latter of which is approximated with a size-invariant learned optimization problem. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulations on a quadruple tank system, illustrating that the learned controller can reduce the computational time of DeePC by 5x while maintaining its control performance.">

        <tr id="This paper details how the Bayesian-network structure of the posterior distribution of state-space models can be exploited to build improved parameterizations for system identification using variational inference. Three different parameterizations of the assumed state-path posterior distribution are proposed based on this representation: time-varying, steady-state, and convolution-smoother; each resulting in a different parameter estimation method. In contrast to existing methods for variational system identification, the proposed estimators can be implemented with unconstrained optimization methods. Furthermore, when applied to mini-batches in conjunction with stochastic optimization methods, the convolution-smoother formulation enables identification of large linear and nonlinear state-space systems from very large datasets. For linear systems, the method achieves the same performance as the inherently sequential prediction-error methods using and embarrassingly parallel algorithm that benefits from large speedups when computed in modern graphical processing units (GPUs). The ability of the proposed estimators to identify large models, work with large datasets split into mini-batches, and be work in parallel on GPUs make them well-suited for identifying deep models for applications in systems and control.">

        <tr id="In recent years, machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning, have shown promising prospects in solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, as the dimension increases, the relationship and interaction between variables become more complex, and existing methods are difficult to provide fast and interpretable solutions for high-dimensional PDEs. To address this issue, we propose a genetic programming symbolic regression algorithm based on transfer learning and automatic differentiation to solve PDEs. This method uses genetic programming to search for a mathematically understandable expression and combines automatic differentiation to determine whether the search result satisfies the PDE and boundary conditions to be solved. To overcome the problem of slow solution speed caused by large search space, we propose a transfer learning mechanism that transfers the structure of one-dimensional PDE analytical solution to the form of high-dimensional PDE solution. We tested three representative types of PDEs, and the results showed that our proposed method can obtain reliable and human-understandable real solutions or algebraic equivalent solutions of PDEs, and the convergence speed is better than the compared methods.

In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), to investigate and explore the solution of the generalized non-linear sine-Gordon equation, encompassing Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. To incorporate physical information for the sine-Gordon equation, a multiobjective loss function has been defined consisting of the residual of governing partial differential equation (PDE), initial conditions, and various boundary conditions. Using multiple densely connected independent artificial neural networks (ANNs), called feedforward deep neural networks designed to handle partial differential equations, PINNs have been trained through automatic differentiation to minimize a loss function that incorporates the given PDE that governs the physical laws of phenomena. To illustrate the effectiveness, validity, and practical implications of our proposed approach, two computational examples from the nonlinear sine-Gordon are presented. We have developed a PINN algorithm and implemented it using Python software. Various experiments were conducted to determine an optimal neural architecture. The network training was employed by using the current state-of-the-art optimization methods in machine learning known as Adam and L-BFGS-B minimization techniques. Additionally, the solutions from the proposed method are compared with the established analytical solutions found in the literature. The findings show that the proposed method is a computational machine learning approach that is accurate and efficient for solving nonlinear sine-Gordon equations with a variety of boundary conditions as well as any complex nonlinear physical problems across multiple disciplines.">

        <tr id="Transport phenomena (e.g., fluid flows) are governed by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) describing mass, momentum, and energy conservation, and are ubiquitous in many engineering applications. However, deep learning architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the simulation of these PDEs. This paper clearly articulates and then solves this incompatibility. The local-dependency of generic transport PDEs implies that it only involves local information to predict the physical properties at a location in the next time step. However, the deep learning architecture will inevitably increase the scope of information to make such predictions as the number of layers increases, which can cause sluggish convergence and compromise generalizability. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a distributed data scoping method with linear time complexity to strictly limit the scope of information to predict the local properties. The numerical experiments over multiple physics show that our data scoping method significantly accelerates training convergence and improves the generalizability of benchmark models on large-scale engineering simulations. Specifically, over the geometries not included in the training data for heat transferring simulation, it can increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 21.7 \% and that of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by 38.5 \% on average.">

        <tr id="In this article, we consider two dynamical systems: the McMillan sextupole and octupole integrable mappings, originally proposed by Edwin McMillan. Both represent the simplest symmetric McMillan maps, characterized by a single intrinsic parameter. While these systems find numerous applications across various domains of mathematics and physics, some of their dynamical properties remain unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive description of all stable trajectories, including the parametrization of invariant curves, Poincar\'e rotation numbers, and canonical action-angle variables. In the second part, we establish connections between these maps and general chaotic maps in standard form. Our investigation reveals that the McMillan sextupole and octupole serve as first-order approximations of the dynamics around the fixed point, akin to the linear map and quadratic invariant (known as the Courant-Snyder invariant in accelerator physics), which represents zeroth-order approximations (referred to as linearization). Furthermore, we propose a novel formalism for nonlinear Twiss parameters, which accounts for the dependence of rotation number on amplitude. This stands in contrast to conventional betatron phase advance used in accelerator physics, which remains independent of amplitude. Notably, in the context of accelerator physics, this new formalism demonstrates its capability in predicting dynamical aperture around low-order resonances for flat beams, a critical aspect in beam injection/extraction scenarios.">

        <tr id="The selection of best variables is a challenging problem in supervised and unsupervised learning, especially in high dimensional contexts where the number of variables is usually much larger than the number of observations. In this paper, we focus on two multivariate statistical methods: principal components analysis and partial least squares. Both approaches are popular linear dimension-reduction methods with numerous applications in several fields including in genomics, biology, environmental science, and engineering. In particular, these approaches build principal components, new variables that are combinations of all the original variables. A main drawback of principal components is the difficulty to interpret them when the number of variables is large. To define principal components from the most relevant variables, we propose to cast the best subset solution path method into principal component analysis and partial least square frameworks. We offer a new alternative by exploiting a continuous optimization algorithm for best subset solution path. Empirical studies show the efficacy of our approach for providing the best subset solution path. The usage of our algorithm is further exposed through the analysis of two real datasets. The first dataset is analyzed using the principle component analysis while the analysis of the second dataset is based on partial least square framework.">

        <tr id="Rogue waves are important physical phenomena, which have wide applications in nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. We find that when using the original PINNs to study rogue waves of high dimensional PDEs, the prediction performance will become very poor, especially for high-order rogue waves due to that the randomness of selection of sample points makes insufficient use of the physical information describing the local sharp regions of rogue waves. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling physics-informed neural network method (ASPINN), which renders the points in local sharp regions to be selected sufficiently by a new adaptive search algorithm to lead to a prefect prediction performance. To valid the performance of our method, the (2+1)-dimensional CHKP equation is taken as an illustrative example. Experimental results reveal that the original PINNs can hardly be able to predict dynamical behaviors of the high-order rogue waves for the CHKP equation, but the ASPINN method can not only predict dynamical behaviors of these high-order rogue waves, but also greatly improve the prediction efficiency and accuracy to four orders of magnitude. Then, the data-driven inverse problem for the CHKP equation with different levels of corrupted noise is studied to show that the ASPINN method has good robustness. Moreover, some main factors affecting the neural network performance are discussed in detail, including the size of training data, the number of layers of the neural network, and the number of neurons per layer.">

        <tr id="The intersection between classical data assimilation methods and novel machine learning techniques has attracted significant interest in recent years. Here we explore another promising solution in which diffusion models are used to formulate a robust nonlinear ensemble filter for sequential data assimilation. Unlike standard machine learning methods, the proposed \textit{Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF)} is completely training-free and can efficiently generate a set of analysis ensemble members. In this study, we apply the EnSF to a surface quasi-geostrophic model and compare its performance against the popular Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF), which makes Gaussian assumptions on the posterior distribution. Numerical tests demonstrate that EnSF maintains stable performance in the absence of localization and for a variety of experimental settings. We find that EnSF achieves competitive performance relative to LETKF in the case of linear observations, but leads to significant advantages when the state is nonlinearly observed and the numerical model is subject to unexpected shocks. A spectral decomposition of the analysis results shows that the largest improvements over LETKF occur at large scales (small wavenumbers) where LETKF lacks sufficient ensemble spread. Overall, this initial application of EnSF to a geophysical model of intermediate complexity is very encouraging, and motivates further developments of the algorithm for more realistic problems.">

        <tr id="We revisit the problem of predicting the output of an LTI system directly using offline input-output data (and without the use of a parametric model) in the behavioral setting. Existing works calculate the output predictions by projecting the recent samples of the input and output signals onto the column span of a Hankel matrix consisting of the offline input-output data. However, if the offline data is corrupted by noise, the output prediction is no longer exact. While some prior works propose mitigating noisy data through matrix low-ranking approximation heuristics, such as truncated singular value decomposition, the ensuing prediction accuracy remains unquantified. This paper fills these gaps by introducing two upper bounds on the prediction error under the condition that the noise is sufficiently small relative to the offline data's magnitude. The first bound pertains to prediction using the raw offline data directly, while the second one applies to the case of low-ranking approximation heuristic. Notably, the bounds do not require the ground truth about the system output, relying solely on noisy measurements with a known noise level and system order. Extensive numerical simulations show that both bounds decrease monotonically (and linearly) as a function of the noise level. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that applying the de-noising heuristic in the output error setup does not generally lead to a better prediction accuracy as compared to using raw data directly, nor a smaller upper bound on the prediction error. However, it allows for a more general upper bound, as the first upper bound requires a specific condition on the partitioning of the Hankel matrix.">

        <tr id="The stable numerical integration of shocks in compressible flow simulations relies on the reduction or elimination of Gibbs phenomena (unstable, spurious oscillations). A popular method to virtually eliminate Gibbs oscillations caused by numerical discretization in under-resolved simulations is to use a flux limiter. A wide range of flux limiters has been studied in the literature, with recent interest in their optimization via machine learning methods trained on high-resolution datasets. The common use of flux limiters in numerical codes as plug-and-play blackbox components makes them key targets for design improvement. Moreover, while aleatoric (inherent randomness) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainty is commonplace in fluid dynamical systems, these effects are generally ignored in the design of flux limiters. Even for deterministic dynamical models, numerical uncertainty is introduced via coarse-graining required by insufficient computational power to solve all scales of motion. Here, we introduce a conceptually distinct type of flux limiter that is designed to handle the effects of randomness in the model and uncertainty in model parameters. This new, {\it probabilistic flux limiter}, learned with high-resolution data, consists of a set of flux limiting functions with associated probabilities, which define the frequencies of selection for their use. Using the example of Burgers' equation, we show that a machine learned, probabilistic flux limiter may be used in a shock capturing code to more accurately capture shock profiles. In particular, we show that our probabilistic flux limiter outperforms standard limiters, and can be successively improved upon (up to a point) by expanding the set of probabilistically chosen flux limiting functions.">

PM implements a change of variables in order to represent trajectories of a system of ordinary differential equations ``as simply as possible."In this paper we pursue a similar goal for stochastic oscillator systems. For planar nonlinear stochastic systems that are ``robustly oscillatory", we find a change of variables through which the dynamics are as simple as possible $\textit{in the mean}$. We prove existence and uniqueness of a deterministic vector field, the trajectories of which capture the local mean behavior of the stochastic oscillator. We illustrate the construction of such an ``effective vector field"for several examples, including a limit cycle oscillator perturbed by noise, an excitable system derived from a spiking neuron model, and a spiral sink with noise forcing (2D Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process). The latter examples comprise contingent oscillators that would not sustain rhythmic activity without noise forcing. Finally, we exploit the simplicity of the dynamics after the change of variables to obtain the effective diffusion constant of the resulting phase variable, and the stationary variance of the resulting amplitude (isostable) variable.">

        <tr id="Physics-guided neural networks (PGNN) is an effective tool that combines the benefits of data-driven modeling with the interpretability and generalization of underlying physical information. However, for a classical PGNN, the penalization of the physics-guided part is at the output level, which leads to a conservative result as systems with highly similar state-transition functions, i.e. only slight differences in parameters, can have significantly different time-series outputs. Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.">

Moreover, model discovery problems are starting to emerge and can also be addressed in a parameter estimation framework. These developments call for a new unified perspective, which is able to cover both traditional parameter estimation methods and novel approaches in which the state variables or the model structure itself are inferred as well. Adopting concepts discussed in the inverse problems community, we distinguish between all-at-once and reduced approaches. With this general framework, we are able to structure a large portion of the literature on parameter estimation in computational mechanics - and we can identify combinations that have not yet been addressed, two of which are proposed in this paper. We also discuss statistical approaches to quantify the uncertainty related to the estimated parameters, and we propose a novel two-step procedure for identification of complex material models based on both frequentist and Bayesian principles. Finally, we illustrate and compare several of the aforementioned methods with mechanical benchmarks based on synthetic and real data.">

        <tr id="Widespread deployment of societal-scale machine learning systems necessitates a thorough understanding of the resulting long-term effects these systems have on their environment, including loss of trustworthiness, bias amplification, and violation of AI safety requirements. We introduce a repeated learning process to jointly describe several phenomena attributed to unintended hidden feedback loops, such as error amplification, induced concept drift, echo chambers and others. The process comprises the entire cycle of obtaining the data, training the predictive model, and delivering predictions to end-users within a single mathematical model. A distinctive feature of such repeated learning setting is that the state of the environment becomes causally dependent on the learner itself over time, thus violating the usual assumptions about the data distribution. We present a novel dynamical systems model of the repeated learning process and prove the limiting set of probability distributions for positive and negative feedback loop modes of the system operation. We conduct a series of computational experiments using an exemplary supervised learning problem on two synthetic data sets. The results of the experiments correspond to the theoretical predictions derived from the dynamical model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for studying the repeated learning processes in machine learning systems and open a range of opportunities for further research in the area.">

Previous works have proposed potentially effective actuators and assessed their capabilities to achieve weather modification objectives through numerical simulations. However, few studies have explored efficient mathematical and computational methods to inversely determine optimal actuators from specific modification goals. Here I demonstrate the utility of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)-based control method, referred to as ensemble Kalman control (EnKC). The series of numerical experiments with the Lorenz 96 model indicates that EnKC efficiently identifies local, small, and intermittent control perturbations that can mitigate extreme events. The existing techniques of EnKF, such as background error covariance localization and observation error covariance inflation, can improve the sparsity and efficiency of the control. This work paves the way toward the real-world applications of EnKC to explore the controllability of extreme atmospheric events.">

In practice, these operators typically need to be approximated from data. Popular approximation methods are extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) and generator extended mode decomposition (gEDMD). We propose a unified framework that leverages Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the operator of interest on a finite-dimensional space spanned by a set of basis functions. Our framework contains EDMD and gEDMD as special cases, but can also be used to approximate more general operators. Our key contributions are proofs of the convergence of the approximating operator and its spectrum under non-restrictive conditions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence rates and account for the presence of noise in the observations. Whilst all these results are broadly applicable, they also refine previous analyses of EDMD and gEDMD. We verify the analytical results with the aid of several numerical experiments.">

        <tr id="Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a method to control nonlinear systems with guaranteed stability and constraint satisfaction but suffers from high computation times. Approximate MPC (AMPC) with neural networks (NNs) has emerged to address this limitation, enabling deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. However, when tuning AMPCs for real-world systems, large datasets need to be regenerated and the NN needs to be retrained at every tuning step. This work introduces a novel, parameter-adaptive AMPC architecture capable of online tuning without recomputing large datasets and retraining. By incorporating local sensitivities of nonlinear programs, the proposed method not only mimics optimal MPC inputs but also adjusts to changes in physical parameters of the model using linear predictions while still guaranteeing stability. We showcase the effectiveness of parameter-adaptive AMPC by controlling the swing-ups of two different real cartpole systems with a severely resource-constrained microcontroller (MCU). We use the same NN across both system instances that have different parameters. This work not only represents the first experimental demonstration of AMPC for fast-moving systems on low-cost MCUs to the best of our knowledge, but also showcases generalization across system instances and variations through our parameter-adaptation method. Taken together, these contributions represent a marked step toward the practical application of AMPC in real-world systems.">

        <tr id="In aerodynamics, characterizing the aerodynamic behavior of aircraft typically requires a large number of observation data points. Real experiments can generate thousands of data points with suitable accuracy, but they are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Consequently, conducting real experiments at new input configurations might be impractical. To address this challenge, data-driven surrogate models have emerged as a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative. They provide simplified mathematical representations that approximate the output of interest. Models based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) have gained popularity in aerodynamics due to their ability to provide accurate predictions and quantify uncertainty while maintaining tractable execution times. To handle large datasets, sparse approximations of GPs have been further investigated to reduce the computational complexity of exact inference. In this paper, we revisit and adapt two classic sparse methods for GPs to address the specific requirements frequently encountered in aerodynamic applications. We compare different strategies for choosing the inducing inputs, which significantly impact the complexity reduction. We formally integrate our implementations into the open-source Python toolbox SMT, enabling the use of sparse methods across the GP regression pipeline. We demonstrate the performance of our Sparse GP (SGP) developments in a comprehensive 1D analytic example as well as in a real wind tunnel application with thousands of training data points.">

        <tr id="Motivation Successfully predicting the development of biological systems can lead to advances in various research fields, such as cellular biology and epidemiology. While machine learning has proven its capabilities in generalizing the underlying non-linear dynamics of such systems, unlocking its predictive power is often restrained by the limited availability of large, curated datasets. To supplement real-world data, informing machine learning by transfer learning with data simulated from ordinary differential equations has emerged as a promising solution. However, the success of this approach highly depends on the designed characteristics of the synthetic data. Results We optimize dataset characteristics such as size, diversity, and noise of ordinary differential equation-based synthetic time series datasets in three relevant and representative biological systems. To achieve this, we here, for the first time, present a framework to systematically evaluate the influence of such design choices on transfer learning performance in one place. We achieve a performance improvement of up to 92% in mean absolute error for our optimized simulation-based transfer learning compared to non-informed deep learning. We find a strong interdependency between dataset size and diversity effects. The optimal transfer learning setting heavily relies on real-world data characteristics as well as its coherence with the synthetic data’s dynamics, emphasizing the relevance of such a framework.

The motivation comes from approximations in quantum dynamics by multiple Gaussians and approximations of various dynamical problems by tensor networks and neural networks. In all these cases, the parametrization is typically irregular: the derivative $\Phi'(q)$ can have arbitrarily small singular values and may have varying rank. We derive approximation results for a regularized approach in the time-continuous case as well as in time-discretized cases. With a suitable choice of the regularization parameter and the time stepsize, the approach can be successfully applied in irregular situations, even though it runs counter to the basic principle in numerical analysis to avoid solving ill-posed subproblems when aiming for a stable algorithm. Numerical experiments with sums of Gaussians for approximating quantum dynamics and with neural networks for approximating the flow map of a system of ordinary differential equations illustrate and complement the theoretical results.">

It is based on a longstanding pipeline familiar to the control community in which one performs experiments on the environment to collect a dataset, uses the resulting dataset to identify a model of the system, and finally performs control synthesis using the identified model. As interacting with the system may be costly and time consuming, targeted exploration is crucial for developing an effective control-oriented model with minimal experimentation. Motivated by this challenge, recent work has begun to study finite sample data requirements and sample efficient algorithms for the problem of optimal exploration in model-based reinforcement learning. However, existing theory and algorithms are limited to model classes which are linear in the parameters. Our work instead focuses on models with nonlinear parameter dependencies, and presents the first finite sample analysis of an active learning algorithm suitable for a general class of nonlinear dynamics. In certain settings, the excess control cost of our algorithm achieves the optimal rate, up to logarithmic factors.

        <tr id="State estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems has long aimed to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The rapid evolution of various industries has amplified the demand for estimation frameworks that satisfy all these factors. This study introduces a neuromorphic approach for robust filtering of nonlinear dynamical systems: SNN-EMSIF (spiking neural network-extended modified sliding innovation filter). SNN-EMSIF combines the computational efficiency and scalability of SNNs with the robustness of EMSIF, an estimation framework designed for nonlinear systems with zero-mean Gaussian noise. Notably, the weight matrices are designed according to the system model, eliminating the need for a learning process. The framework's efficacy is evaluated through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing SNN-EMSIF with EKF and EMSIF. Additionally, it is compared with SNN-EKF in the presence of modeling uncertainties and neuron loss, using RMSEs as a metric. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of SNN-EMSIF. Further analysis of runtimes and spiking patterns reveals an impressive reduction of 85% in emitted spikes compared to possible spikes, highlighting the computational efficiency of SNN-EMSIF.

In this study, we propose an integrated reservoir predictor for making accurate and robust multistep-ahead forecasts based on short-term high-dimensional time series. Initially, a conjugated pair of Spatiotemporal Information (STI) equations is derived using Takens’ embedding theory to transform the spatial information of high-dimensional variables into one-dimensional temporal information of the target variable and vice versa. Next, by exploiting reservoir networks, reservoir-based STI equations are established to efficiently capture nonlinear dynamics of the target system with only linear optimization. Then, through an integration phase, the integrated reservoir predictor can output precise and robust predictions of the multistep-ahead states of any target variable. The integrated reservoir predictor outperforms some other prediction methods (including reservoir computing, long-short-term-memory network, convolutional neural network and support vector regression), when applied to classical dynamic systems (e.g. 60D double scroll model, 40D Lorenz 96 model, and 60D Rössler model) and real-world datasets (solar generation data and PM2.5 concentration records), as indicated by evaluation metrics such as Pearson correlation coefficients exceeding 0.9 and root-mean-square errors below 0.3, even in the presence of noise in training data.">

Artificial intelligence technologies include machine learning and deep learning, which can be used for tasks such as prediction and classification, anomaly detection, optimization and decision-making. In mathematical modelling of complex systems, artificial intelligence technology can learn system patterns and laws from large amounts of data, and can be applied to image and speech recognition, time series analysis and other fields. Deep learning and machine learning are important branches of artificial intelligence. They realize the modelling and analysis of complex systems by building neural network models. Data-driven modelling is a modelling method based on actual data that, combined with traditional theoretical modelling, can better describe and predict the behaviour of complex systems. Self-control of complex systems means that the system realizes its own optimization and adjustment through adaptive control algorithms and feedback mechanisms. In summary, artificial intelligence technology has broad application prospects in mathematical modelling of complex systems and will provide new tools and methods for in-depth understanding and solving problems in complex systems.">

The FCM is based on simulated trajectory data, and it uses this data to train a kernel model. The FCM identifies low-dimensional subspaces that optimally describe the $A$ to $B$ transitions, and the subspaces are emphasized in the kernel model. The FCM uses randomized numerical linear algebra to train the model with runtime that scales linearly in the number of data points. This paper applies the FCM to example systems including the alanine dipeptide miniprotein: in these experiments, the FCM is generally more accurate and trains more quickly than a neural network with a similar number of parameters.">

        <tr id="Model inversion is a fundamental technique in feedforward control. Unstable inverse models present a challenge in that useful feedforward control trajectories cannot be generated by directly propagating them. Stable inversion is a process for generating useful trajectories from unstable inverses by handling their stable and unstable modes separately. Piecewise affine (PWA) systems are a popular framework for modeling complicated dynamics. The primary contributions of this article are closed-form inverse formulas for a general class of PWA models, and stable inversion methods for these models. Both contributions leverage closed-form model representations to prove sufficient conditions for solution existence and uniqueness, and to develop solution computation methods. The result is implementable feedforward control synthesis from PWA models with either stable or unstable inverses. In practice, feedforward control alone may yield substantial tracking errors due to mismatch between the known system model and the unknowable complete system physics. Iterative learning control (ILC) is a technique for achieving robustness to model error in feedforward control. To demonstrate the primary contributions' validity and utility, this article also integrates PWA stable inversion with ILC in simulations based on a physical printhead positioning system.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we consider the problem of reference tracking in uncertain nonlinear systems. A neural State-Space Model (NSSM) is used to approximate the nonlinear system, where a deep encoder network learns the nonlinearity from data, and a state-space component captures the temporal relationship. This transforms the nonlinear system into a linear system in a latent space, enabling the application of model predictive control (MPC) to determine effective control actions. Our objective is to design the optimal controller using limited data from the \textit{target system} (the system of interest). To this end, we employ an implicit model-agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) framework that leverages information from \textit{source systems} (systems that share similarities with the target system) to expedite training in the target system and enhance its control performance. The framework consists of two phases: the (offine) meta-training phase learns a aggregated NSSM using data from source systems, and the (online) meta-inference phase quickly adapts this aggregated model to the target system using only a few data points and few online training iterations, based on local loss function gradients. The iMAML algorithm exploits the implicit function theorem to exactly compute the gradient during training, without relying on the entire optimization path. By focusing solely on the optimal solution, rather than the path, we can meta-train with less storage complexity and fewer approximations than other contemporary meta-learning algorithms. We demonstrate through numerical examples that our proposed method can yield accurate predictive models by adaptation, resulting in a downstream MPC that outperforms several baselines.">

        <tr id="The process of training an artificial neural network involves iteratively adapting its parameters so as to minimize the error of the network’s prediction, when confronted with a learning task. This iterative change can be naturally interpreted as a trajectory in network space–a time series of networks–and thus the training algorithm (e.g., gradient descent optimization of a suitable loss function) can be interpreted as a dynamical system in graph space. In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime. Our findings are put in contrast to common wisdom on convergence properties of neural networks and dynamical systems theory. This work also contributes to the cross-fertilization of ideas between dynamical systems theory, network theory and machine learning.">

By exploiting process operation data, both process modeling and state estimation design are addressed within a distributed framework. By leveraging the Koopman operator concept, a parallel subsystem modeling approach is proposed to establish interactive linear subsystem process models in higher-dimensional subspaces, each of which correlates with the original nonlinear subspace of the corresponding process subsystem via a nonlinear mapping. The data-driven linear subsystem models can be used to collaboratively characterize and predict the dynamical behaviors of the entire nonlinear process. Based on the established subsystem models, local state estimators that can explicitly handle process operation constraints are designed using moving horizon estimation. The local estimators are integrated via information exchange to form a distributed estimation scheme, which provides estimates of the unmeasured/unmeasurable state variables of the original nonlinear process in a linear manner. The proposed framework is applied to a chemical process and an agro-hydrological process to illustrate its effectiveness and applicability. Good open-loop predictability of the linear subsystem models is confirmed, and accurate estimates of the process states are obtained without requiring a first-principles process model.">

This phenomenon, known as causal emergence, is quantified by the indicator of effective information. However, two challenges confront this theory: the absence of well-developed frameworks in continuous stochastic dynamical systems and the reliance on coarse-graining methodologies. In this study, we introduce an exact theoretic framework for causal emergence within linear stochastic iteration systems featuring continuous state spaces and Gaussian noise. Building upon this foundation, we derive an analytical expression for effective information across general dynamics and identify optimal linear coarse-graining strategies that maximize the degree of causal emergence when the dimension averaged uncertainty eliminated by coarse-graining has an upper bound. Our investigation reveals that the maximal causal emergence and the optimal coarse-graining methods are primarily determined by the principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamic system's parameter matrix, with the latter not being unique. To validate our propositions, we apply our analytical models to three simplified physical systems, comparing the outcomes with numerical simulations, and consistently achieve congruent results.">

The FNO model is first used for predicting three-dimensional compressible turbulence. The different magnitudes of physical fields are normalized using root mean square values for an easier training of FNO models. In the \emph{a posteriori} tests, the FNO model outperforms the velocity gradient model (VGM), the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM), and implicit large eddy simulation (ILES) in predicting various statistical quantities and instantaneous structures, and is particularly superior to traditional LES methods in predicting temperature fields and velocity divergence. Moreover, the computational efficiency of the FNO model is much higher than that of traditional LES methods. FNO models trained with short-time, low Reynolds number data exhibit a good generalization performance on longer-time predictions and higher Reynolds numbers in the \emph{a posteriori} tests.">

        <tr id="Recurrent Neural Networks excel at predicting and generating complex high-dimensional temporal patterns. Due to their inherent nonlinear dynamics and memory, they can learn unbounded temporal dependencies from data. In a Machine Learning setting, the network's parameters are adapted during a training phase to match the requirements of a given task/problem increasing its computational capabilities. After the training, the network parameters are kept fixed to exploit the learned computations. The static parameters thereby render the network unadaptive to changing conditions, such as external or internal perturbation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how keeping parts of the network adaptive even after the training enhances its functionality and robustness. Here, we utilize the conceptor framework and conceptualize an adaptive control loop analyzing the network's behavior continuously and adjusting its time-varying internal representation to follow a desired target. We demonstrate how the added adaptivity of the network supports the computational functionality in three distinct tasks: interpolation of temporal patterns, stabilization against partial network degradation, and robustness against input distortion. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive networks in machine learning beyond training, enabling them to not only learn complex patterns but also dynamically adjust to changing environments, ultimately broadening their applicability.">

        <tr id="Recursive Bayesian filters have been widely deployed in structural system identification where output-only filters are of higher practicality. Unfortunately, the estimation obtained by instantaneous system inversion via filters can be compromised by an ill-conditionedness of the system, which is a consequence of the architecture of the sensor network. To significantly reduce the ill-conditioning and increase the robustness to available networks, a new recursive smoothing algorithm is proposed for simultaneous input and state estimation of linear systems. Unlike the existing minimum-variance unbiased (MVU) smoothing methods that are restricted to either systems with no direct feedthrough or systems with a full-rank feedforward matrix, the proposed smoothing algorithm is universally applicable to linear systems with and without direct feedthrough as well as those with a rank-deficient feedforward matrix. The proposed smoothing method does not assume any prior knowledge of the statistical characteristics or evolutionary model pertaining to the input. A different indexing of the discrete-time input leads to a distinct linear algebra from the existing MVU smoothing methods. An eight-storey shear frame and the Taipei 101 tower in Taiwan are used as case studies, and a thorough comparison is established with the Augmented Kalman Filter, MVU filters and MVU smoothing methods. It is shown that the incorporation of singular value truncation for system inversion can result in a noticeable improvement in the estimation. Moreover, across various sensor networks and in the presence of a rank-deficient feedforward matrix, the proposed method could achieve at least 67% noise reduction compared to other filters and at least 30% improvement compared to other smoothing methods.">

One example corresponds to the field of air traffic management, in which one basis for weather detection is set upon recordings from sparse weather stations on ground. The scarcity of data and their lack of precision poses significant challenges to achieve a detailed description of the atmosphere state at a certain moment in time. Methods In this article, we foster the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a type of machine learning (ML) architecture which embeds mathematically accurate physics models, to generate high-quality weather information subject to the regularization provided by the Navier-Stokes equations. Results The application of PINNs is oriented to the reconstruction of dense and precise wind and pressure fields in areas where only a few local measurements provided by weather stations are available. Our model does not only disclose and regularize such data, which are potentially corrupted by noise, but is also able to precisely compute wind and pressure in target areas. Conclusions The effect of time and spatial resolution over the capability of the PINN to accurately reconstruct fluid phenomena is thoroughly discussed through a parametric study, concluding that a proper tuning of the neural network’s loss function during training is of utmost importance.">

        <tr id="Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.">

We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points.

The derived NLPs are represented through the Lagrangian formulation, which enforces the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions for the optimization problem to be solvable. The main novelty suggests that the problem can still be efficiently solvable with a significantly lower computational load by approximating certain terms to reduce the computational burden. The proposed method is compared with other state-of-the-art approaches on standard performance measures. Moreover, we provide convergence analysis that can assert further theoretical guarantees in control, such as stability and recursive feasibility.

As opposed to traditional methods, SIM-FSVGD leverages low-fidelity physical priors, e.g., in the form of simulators, to regularize the training of neural network models. While learning accurate dynamics already in the low data regime, SIM-FSVGD scales and excels also when more data is available. We empirically show that learning with implicit physical priors results in accurate mean model estimation as well as precise uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SIM-FSVGD in bridging the sim-to-real gap on a high-performance RC racecar system.

The effectiveness of deep learning in addressing differential equations motivates us to employ these methods for solving SPDEs. In this paper, we introduce Component Fourier Neural Operator (ComFNO), an innovative operator learning method that builds upon Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), while simultaneously incorporating valuable prior knowledge obtained from asymptotic analysis. Our approach is not limited to FNO and can be applied to other neural network frameworks, such as Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), leading to potential similar SPDEs solvers.

Among various iteration structures, model-based approaches require the input-output sensitivity of the system to construct gradients, whereas model-free approaches bypass this need by estimating gradients from real-time evaluations of the objective. These approaches own complementary benefits in sample efficiency and accuracy against model mismatch, i.e., errors of sensitivities. To achieve the best of both worlds, we propose gray-box feedback optimization controllers, featuring systematic incorporation of approximate sensitivities into model-free updates via adaptive convex combination. We quantify conditions on the accuracy of the sensitivities that render the gray-box approach preferable. We elucidate how the closed-loop performance is determined by the number of iterations, the problem dimension, and the cumulative effect of inaccurate sensitivities. The proposed controller contributes to a balanced closed-loop behavior, which retains provable sample efficiency and optimality guarantees for nonconvex problems. We further develop a running gray-box controller to handle constrained time-varying problems with changing objectives and steady-state maps.">

Designing flexible stationary covariance functions is, however, straightforward in the spectral domain, where one needs only to supply a positive and symmetric spectral density. In this work, we introduce an adaptive integration framework for efficiently and accurately evaluating covariance functions and their derivatives at irregular locations directly from \textit{any} continuous, integrable spectral density. In order to make this approach computationally tractable, we employ high-order panel quadrature, the nonuniform fast Fourier transform, and a Nyquist-informed panel selection heuristic, and derive novel algebraic truncation error bounds which are used to monitor convergence. As a result, we demonstrate several orders of magnitude speedup compared to naive uniform quadrature approaches, allowing us to evaluate covariance functions from slowly decaying, singular spectral densities at millions of locations to a user-specified tolerance in seconds on a laptop. We then apply our methodology to perform gradient-based maximum likelihood estimation using a previously numerically infeasible long-memory spectral model for wind velocities below the atmospheric boundary layer.">

        <tr id="We study online policy optimization in nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems where the true dynamical models are unknown to the controller. This problem is challenging because, unlike in linear systems, the controller cannot obtain globally accurate estimations of the ground-truth dynamics using local exploration. We propose a meta-framework that combines a general online policy optimization algorithm ($\texttt{ALG}$) with a general online estimator of the dynamical system's model parameters ($\texttt{EST}$). We show that if the hypothetical joint dynamics induced by $\texttt{ALG}$ with known parameters satisfies several desired properties, the joint dynamics under inexact parameters from $\texttt{EST}$ will be robust to errors. Importantly, the final policy regret only depends on $\texttt{EST}$'s predictions on the visited trajectory, which relaxes a bottleneck on identifying the true parameters globally. To demonstrate our framework, we develop a computationally efficient variant of Gradient-based Adaptive Policy Selection, called Memoryless GAPS (M-GAPS), and use it to instantiate $\texttt{ALG}$. Combining M-GAPS with online gradient descent to instantiate $\texttt{EST}$ yields (to our knowledge) the first local regret bound for online policy optimization in nonlinear time-varying systems with unknown dynamics.">

For such symbolic regression tasks, biology-inspired evolutionary algorithms are most widely used. However, typical evolutionary algorithms do not utilize any structural information inherent in training data, which limits their performance in finding accurate model structures and coefficients. By combining one evolutionary algorithm, gene expression programing (GEP), with an artificial neural network (ANN) for symbolic regression, we propose a novel evolutionary neural network method, in which candidate expressions are specifically designed so that they can be transformed between the GEP and ANN structures during training iterations. By combining the GEP's global searching and the ANN's gradient optimization capabilities, efficient and robust convergence to accurate models can be achieved. In addition, sparsity-enhancing strategies have been introduced to improve the interpretability of the trained models. The present method has been tested for finding different physical laws and then applied to turbulence modeling problems with different configurations, showing advantages compared to the existing GEP and ANN methods.">

Inspired by the integral feedback control mechanism by which E.coli are proposed to sense their environment, we develop a numerical responsive active Brownian particle (rABP) model in which the rABPs continuously react to changes in the physical parameters dictated by their local environment. The resulting generated time series are then used to classify and characterise their response, leading to the identification of conditional heteroscedasticity in their physics. We then train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) capable of quantitatively describing the responsiveness of rABPs using their 2-D trajectories.

We propose a class of provably stable latent DS with possibly multiple attractors, that inherit the training methods of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, thus, dropping the dependency on state derivative information. A diffeomorphic mapping for the output and a loss that captures time-invariant trajectory similarity are proposed.

        <tr id="Stochastic reaction networks are widely used in the modeling of stochastic systems across diverse domains such as biology, chemistry, physics, and ecology. However, the comprehension of the dynamic behaviors inherent in stochastic reaction networks is a formidable undertaking, primarily due to the exponential growth in the number of possible states or trajectories as the state space dimension increases. In this study, we introduce a knowledge distillation method based on reinforcement learning principles, aimed at compressing the dynamical knowledge encoded in stochastic reaction networks into a singular neural network construct. The trained neural network possesses the capability to accurately predict the state conditional joint probability distribution that corresponds to the given query contexts, when prompted with rate parameters, initial conditions, and time values. This obviates the need to track the dynamical process, enabling the direct estimation of normalized state and trajectory probabilities, without necessitating the integration over the complete state space. By applying our method to representative examples, we have observed a high degree of accuracy in both multimodal and high-dimensional systems. Additionally, the trained neural network can serve as a foundational model for developing efficient algorithms for parameter inference and trajectory ensemble generation. These results collectively underscore the efficacy of our approach as a universal means of distilling knowledge from stochastic reaction networks. Importantly, our methodology also spotlights the potential utility in harnessing a singular, pretrained, large-scale model to encapsulate the solution space underpinning a wide spectrum of stochastic dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a new boundary-value problem formulation for quantifying uncertainty induced by the presence of small Brownian noise near transversally stable periodic orbits (limit cycles) and quasiperiodic invariant tori of the deterministic dynamical systems obtained in the absence of noise. The formulation uses adjoints to construct a continuous family of transversal hyperplanes that are invariant under the linearized deterministic flow near the limit cycle or quasiperiodic invariant torus. The intersections with each hyperplane of stochastic trajectories that remain near the deterministic cycle or torus over intermediate times may be approximated by a Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix can be obtained from the solution to the corresponding boundary-value problem. In the case of limit cycles, the analysis improves upon results in the literature through the explicit use of state-space projections, transversality constraints, and symmetry-breaking parameters that ensure uniqueness of the solution despite the lack of hyperbolicity along the limit cycle. These same innovations are then generalized to the case of a quasiperiodic invariant torus of arbitrary dimension. In each case, a closed-form solution to the covariance boundary-value problem is found in terms of a convergent series. The methodology is validated against the results of numerical integration for two examples of stochastically perturbed limit cycles and one example of a stochastically perturbed two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus. Finally, an implementation of the covariance boundary-value problem in the numerical continuation package coco is applied to analyze the small-noise limit near a two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus in a nonlinear deterministic dynamical system in $\mathbb{R}^4$ that does not support closed-form analysis.">

The characteristics for different values of the hyper-parameters are captured universally by a single ML model, while the previous works considered training the ML model independently by fixing the hyper-parameters to be specific values. Our benchmarks on the one- and two-dimensional Logistic maps show that variational quantum circuit can reproduce the long-term characteristics with higher accuracy than the long short-term memory (a well-recognized classical ML model). Our work reveals an essential difference between the ML for the chaotic characteristics and that for standard tasks, from the perspective of the relation between performance and model complexity. Our results suggest that quantum circuit model exhibits potential advantages on mitigating over-fitting, achieving higher accuracy and stability.">

While the U-Net architecture with skip connections is commonly used by prior studies to enable multi-scale processing, our analysis shows that the need for features to evolve across layers results in temporally misaligned features in skip connections, which limits the model's performance. To address this limitation, we propose SineNet, consisting of multiple sequentially connected U-shaped network blocks, referred to as waves. In SineNet, high-resolution features are evolved progressively through multiple stages, thereby reducing the amount of misalignment within each stage. We furthermore analyze the role of skip connections in enabling both parallel and sequential processing of multi-scale information. Our method is rigorously tested on multiple PDE datasets, including the Navier-Stokes equations and shallow water equations, showcasing the advantages of our proposed approach over conventional U-Nets with a comparable parameter budget. We further demonstrate that increasing the number of waves in SineNet while maintaining the same number of parameters leads to a monotonically improved performance. The results highlight the effectiveness of SineNet and the potential of our approach in advancing the state-of-the-art in neural PDE solver design.

        <tr id="The stochastic finite volume method offers an efficient one-pass approach for assessing uncertainty in hyperbolic conservation laws. Still, it struggles with the curse of dimensionality when dealing with multiple stochastic variables. We introduce the stochastic finite volume method within the tensor-train framework to counteract this limitation. This integration, however, comes with its own set of difficulties, mainly due to the propensity for shock formation in hyperbolic systems. To overcome these issues, we have developed a tensor-train-adapted stochastic finite volume method that employs a global WENO reconstruction, making it suitable for such complex systems. This approach represents the first step in designing tensor-train techniques for hyperbolic systems and conservation laws involving shocks.">

        <tr id="Semantic Information Theory (SIT) offers a new approach to evaluating the information architecture of complex systems. In this study we describe the steps required to {\it operationalize} SIT via its application to dynamical problems. Our road map has four steps: (1) separating the dynamical system into agent-environment sub-systems; (2) choosing an appropriate coarse graining and quantifying correlations; (3) identifying a measure of viability; (4) implementing a scrambling protocol and measuring the semantic content. We apply the road map to a model inspired by the neural dynamics of epileptic seizures whereby an agent (a control process) attempts to maintain an environment (a base process) in a desynchronized state. The synchronization dynamics is studied through the well-known Kuramoto model of phase synchronization. Our application of SIT to this problem reveals new features of both semantic information and the Kuramoto model. For the latter we find articulating the correlational structure for agent and environment(the oscillators), allows us to cast the model in in a novel computational (information theoretic) perspective, where the agent-environment dynamics can be thought of as analyzing a communication channel. For the former we find that all the information in our system is semantic. This is in contrast to previous SIT studies of foragers in which semantic thresholds where seen above which no further semantic content was obtained.">

PDEs evolve over broad scales and exhibit diverse behaviors; predicting these phenomena will require learning representations across a wide variety of inputs, which may encompass different coefficients, geometries, or equations. As a step towards generalizable PDE modeling, we adapt masked pretraining for PDEs. Through self-supervised learning across PDEs, masked autoencoders can learn useful latent representations for downstream tasks. In particular, masked pretraining can improve coefficient regression and timestepping performance of neural solvers on unseen equations. We hope that masked pretraining can emerge as a unifying method across large, unlabeled, and heterogeneous datasets to learn latent physics at scale.">

However, for a prominent and intricate scenario with single-cell gene expression data collected post-intervention across multiple time points, where joint distributions remain unknown, there is only one known specifically developed method, which does not fully utilize the rich information contained in this data type. In response, we introduce an inference approach tailored to this challenging context: netWork infErence by covariaNce DYnamics, dubbed WENDY. The core idea of WENDY is to model the dynamics of the covariance matrix, and solve this dynamics as an optimization problem to determine the regulatory relationships. To assess its efficacy, we benchmark WENDY against alternative inference methods using synthetic data. Our findings underscore WENDY’s robust performance across diverse synthetic datasets. Moreover, we deploy WENDY to analyze three distinct experimental datasets, uncovering potential gene regulatory mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Finite-state abstractions are widely studied for the automated synthesis of correct-by-construction controllers for stochastic dynamical systems. However, existing abstraction methods often lead to prohibitively large finite-state models. To address this issue, we propose a novel abstraction scheme for stochastic linear systems that exploits the system's stability to obtain significantly smaller abstract models. As a unique feature, we first stabilize the open-loop dynamics using a linear feedback gain. We then use a model-based approach to abstract a known part of the stabilized dynamics while using a data-driven method to account for the stochastic uncertainty. We formalize abstractions as Markov decision processes (MDPs) with intervals of transition probabilities. By stabilizing the dynamics, we can further constrain the control input modeled in the abstraction, which leads to smaller abstract models while retaining the correctness of controllers. Moreover, when the stabilizing feedback controller is aligned with the property of interest, then a good trade-off is achieved between the reduction in the abstraction size and the performance loss. The experiments show that our approach can reduce the size of the graph of abstractions by up to 90% with negligible performance loss.">

Kalman filters, although efficient in noise compensation, demand extensive tuning of system and noise models. This paper introduces FlexKalmanNet, a novel modular framework that bridges this gap by integrating a deep fully connected neural network with Kalman filter-based motion estimation algorithms. FlexKalmanNet's core innovation is its ability to learn any Kalman filter parameter directly from measurement data, coupled with the flexibility to utilize various Kalman filter variants. This is achieved through a notable design decision to outsource the sequential computation from the neural network to the Kalman filter variant, enabling a purely feedforward neural network architecture. This architecture, proficient at handling complex, nonlinear features without the dependency on recurrent network modules, captures global data patterns more effectively. Empirical evaluation using data from NASA's Astrobee simulation environment focuses on learning unknown parameters of an Extended Kalman filter for spacecraft pose and twist estimation. The results demonstrate FlexKalmanNet's rapid training convergence, high accuracy, and superior performance against manually tuned Extended Kalman filters.">

Despite well over half a century of research on high-dimensional approximation, this remains a challenging problem. Yet, significant advances have been made in the last decade towards efficient methods for doing this, commencing with so-called sparse polynomial approximation methods and continuing most recently with methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In tandem, there have been substantial advances in the relevant approximation theory and analysis of these techniques. In this work, we survey this recent progress. We describe the contemporary motivations for this problem, which stem from parametric models and computational uncertainty quantification; the relevant function classes, namely, classes of infinite-dimensional, Banach-valued, holomorphic functions; fundamental limits of learnability from finite data for these classes; and finally, sparse polynomial and DNN methods for efficiently learning such functions from finite data. For the latter, there is currently a significant gap between the approximation theory of DNNs and the practical performance of deep learning. Aiming to narrow this gap, we develop the topic of practical existence theory, which asserts the existence of dimension-independent DNN architectures and training strategies that achieve provably near-optimal generalization errors in terms of the amount of training data.">

        <tr id="We address parameter estimation in second-order stochastic differential equations (SDEs), prevalent in physics, biology, and ecology. Second-order SDE is converted to a first-order system by introducing an auxiliary velocity variable raising two main challenges. First, the system is hypoelliptic since the noise affects only the velocity, making the Euler-Maruyama estimator ill-conditioned. To overcome that, we propose an estimator based on the Strang splitting scheme. Second, since the velocity is rarely observed we adjust the estimator for partial observations. We present four estimators for complete and partial observations, using full likelihood or only velocity marginal likelihood. These estimators are intuitive, easy to implement, and computationally fast, and we prove their consistency and asymptotic normality. Our analysis demonstrates that using full likelihood with complete observations reduces the asymptotic variance of the diffusion estimator. With partial observations, the asymptotic variance increases due to information loss but remains unaffected by the likelihood choice. However, a numerical study on the Kramers oscillator reveals that using marginal likelihood for partial observations yields less biased estimators. We apply our approach to paleoclimate data from the Greenland ice core and fit it to the Kramers oscillator model, capturing transitions between metastable states reflecting observed climatic conditions during glacial eras.">

        <tr id="In biochemical modeling, some foundational systems can exhibit sudden and profound behavioral shifts, such as the cellular signaling pathway models, in which the physiological responses promptly react to environmental changes, resulting in steep changes in their dynamic model trajectories. These steep changes are one of the major challenges in biochemical modeling governed by nonlinear differential equations. One promising way to tackle this challenge is converting the input data from the time domain to the frequency domain through Fourier Neural Operators, which enhances the ability to analyze data periodicity and regularity. However, the effectiveness of these Fourier based methods diminishes in scenarios with complex abrupt switches. To address this limitation, an innovative Multiscale Attention Wavelet Neural Operator (MAWNO) method is proposed in this paper, which comprehensively combines the attention mechanism with the versatile wavelet transforms to effectively capture these abrupt switches. Specifically, the wavelet transform scrutinizes data across multiple scales to extract the characteristics of abrupt signals into wavelet coefficients, while the self-attention mechanism is adeptly introduced to enhance the wavelet coefficients in high-frequency signals that can better characterize the abrupt switches. Experimental results substantiate MAWNO’s supremacy in terms of accuracy on three classical biochemical models featuring periodic and steep trajectories. https://github.com/SUDERS/MAWNO.">

Standard GP regression can lead to an unbounded model in which some points can take infeasible values. We introduce a new GP method that enforces the physical constraints in a probabilistic manner. This GP model is trained by the quantum-inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QHMC). QHMC is an efficient way to sample from a broad class of distributions. Unlike the standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm in which a particle has a fixed mass, QHMC allows a particle to have a random mass matrix with a probability distribution. Introducing the QHMC method to the inequality and monotonicity constrained GP regression in the probabilistic sense, our approach improves the accuracy and reduces the variance in the resulting GP model. According to our experiments on several datasets, the proposed approach serves as an efficient method as it accelerates the sampling process while maintaining the accuracy, and it is applicable to high dimensional problems.">

Even though the computational barrier posed by a large ensemble of agents can be overcome through a mean field formulation of the control problem, the feasibility of its solution is generally guaranteed only for agents operating in low-dimensional spaces. To circumvent the difficulty posed by the high dimensionality of the state space a kinetic model is proposed, requiring the sampling of high-dimensional, two-agent sub-problems, to evolve the agents' density using a Boltzmann type equation. Such density evolution requires a high-frequency sampling of two-agent optimal control problems, which is efficiently approximated by means of deep neural networks and supervised learning, enabling the fast simulation of high-dimensional, large-scale ensembles of controlled particles. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the control of consensus and attraction-repulsion dynamics.">

When the intrinsic noise intensity is large, these systems exhibits stochastic transitions from onemetastable steady state to another. In electronic bistable memories, these transitions are failures, usually simulated in a Monte-Carlo fashion at a high CPU-time price. Existing closed-form formulas, relying on near-stable-steady-state approximations of the nonlinear system dynamics to estimate the mean transition time, have turned out inaccurate. Our contribution is twofold. From a unidimensional stochastic model of overdamped autonomous systems, we propose an extended Eyring-Kramers analytical formula accounting for both nonlinear drift and state-dependent white noise variance, rigorously derived from It\^o stochastic calculus. We also adapt it to practical system engineering situations where the intrinsic noise sources are hidden and can only be inferred from the fluctuations of observables measured in steady states. First numerical trials on an industrial electronic case study suggest that our approximate prediction formula achieve remarkable accuracy, outperforming previous non-Monte-Carlo approaches.">

In this paper, we provide the first pointwise bounds on the approximation error of kEDMD. The main idea consists of two steps. First, we show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of Wendland functions are invariant under the Koopman operator.

Data assimilation is crucial for achieving this goal because it provides a systematic framework to calibrate model outputs with observations, which can include remote sensing imagery and ground station measurements, with uncertainty quantification. Conventional methods, including Kalman filters and variational approaches, inherently rely on simplifying linear and Gaussian assumptions, and can be computationally expensive. Nevertheless, with the rapid adoption of data-driven methods in many areas of computational sciences, we see the potential of emulating traditional data assimilation with deep learning, especially generative models. In particular, the diffusion-based probabilistic framework has large overlaps with data assimilation principles: both allows for conditional generation of samples with a Bayesian inverse framework. These models have shown remarkable success in text-conditioned image generation or image-controlled video synthesis. Likewise, one can frame data assimilation as observation-conditioned state calibration. In this work, we propose SLAMS: Score-based Latent Assimilation in Multimodal Setting. Specifically, we assimilate in-situ weather station data and ex-situ satellite imagery to calibrate the vertical temperature profiles, globally. Through extensive ablation, we demonstrate that SLAMS is robust even in low-resolution, noisy, and sparse data settings. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep generative framework for multimodal data assimilation using real-world datasets; an important step for building robust computational simulators, including the next-generation Earth system models.

        <tr id="The probabilistic characterization of non-Markovian responses to nonlinear dynamical systems under colored excitation is an important issue, arising in many applications. Extending the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, governing the first-order response probability density function (pdf), to this case is a complicated task calling for special treatment. In this work, a new pdf-evolution equation is derived for the response of nonlinear dynamical systems under additive colored Gaussian noise. The derivation is based on the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), transformed, by means of an extended version of the Novikov-Furutsu theorem, to an exact yet non-closed equation, involving averages over the history of the functional derivatives of the non-Markovian response with respect to the excitation. The latter are calculated exactly by means of the state-transition matrix of variational, time-varying systems. Subsequently, an approximation scheme is implemented, relying on a decomposition of the state-transition matrix in its instantaneous mean value and its fluctuation around it. By a current-time approximation to the latter, we obtain our final equation, in which the effect of the instantaneous mean value of the response is maintained, rendering it nonlinear and non-local in time. Numerical results for the response pdf are provided for a bistable Duffing oscillator, under Gaussian excitation. The pdfs obtained from the solution of the novel equation and a simpler small correlation time (SCT) pdf-evolution equation are compared to Monde Carlo (MC) simulations. The novel equation outperforms the SCT equation as the excitation correlation time increases, keeping good agreement with the MC simulations.">

However, the solver-intrusive field inversion has a high entry bar, and existing FIML studies focused on improving only steady-state or time-averaged periodic flow predictions. To break this limit, this paper develops an open-source FIML framework for time-accurate unsteady flow, where both spatial and temporal variations of flow are of interest. We augment a Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence model's production term with a scalar field. We then integrate a neural network (NN) model into the flow solver to compute the above augmentation scalar field based on local flow features at each time step. Finally, we optimize the weights and biases of the built-in NN model to minimize the regulated spatial-temporal prediction error between the augmented flow solver and reference data. We consider the spatial-temporal evolution of unsteady flow over a 45° ramp and use only the surface pressure as the training data. The unsteady-FIML-trained model accurately predicts the spatial-temporal variations of unsteady flow fields. In addition, the trained model exhibits reasonably good prediction accuracy for various ramp angles, Reynolds numbers, and flow variables (e.g., velocity fields) that are not used in training, highlighting its generalizability. The FIML capability has been integrated into our open-source framework DAFoam. It has the potential to train more accurate RANS turbulence models for other unsteady flow phenomena, such as wind gust response, bubbly flow, and particle dispersion in the atmosphere.">

The kernel of two bounded variation paths (such as piecewise linear interpolations of time series data) is typically computed by solving a Goursat problem for a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) in two independent time variables. However, this approach becomes considerably less practical for highly oscillatory input paths, as they have to be resolved at a fine enough scale to accurately recover their signature kernel, resulting in significant time and memory complexities. To mitigate this issue, we first show that the signature kernel of a broader class of paths, known as \emph{smooth rough paths}, also satisfies a PDE, albeit in the form of a system of coupled equations. We then use this result to introduce new algorithms for the numerical approximation of signature kernels. As bounded variation paths (and more generally geometric $p$-rough paths) can be approximated by piecewise smooth rough paths, one can replace the PDE with rapidly varying coefficients in the original Goursat problem by an explicit system of coupled equations with piecewise constant coefficients derived from the first few iterated integrals of the original input paths. While this approach requires solving more equations, they do not require looking back at the complex and fine structure of the initial paths, which significantly reduces the computational complexity associated with the analysis of highly oscillatory time series.">

We tested our design with various vehicles (from a Tesla Model 3 to an Ambulance) experiencing malfunctioning and swift steering scenarios. We demonstrate significant improvements in dynamic error rate compared with traditional MPC implementation with up to 89.87% median prediction error reduction with 5 spiking neurons and up to 96.95% with 5000 neurons.

In fields such as economy, politics, and biology, the observation data points in the time series are often independently obtained (i.e., Repeated Cross-Sectional (RCS) data). With RCS data, we found that traditional methods for parameter estimation in differential equations, such as using mean values of time trajectories or Gaussian Process-based trajectory generation, have limitations in estimating the shape of parameter distributions, often leading to a significant loss of data information. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method, Estimation of Parameter Distribution (EPD), providing accurate distribution of parameters without loss of data information. EPD operates in three main steps: generating synthetic time trajectories by randomly selecting observed values at each time point, estimating parameters of a differential equation that minimize the discrepancy between these trajectories and the true solution of the equation, and selecting the parameters depending on the scale of discrepancy. We then evaluated the performance of EPD across several models, including exponential growth, logistic population models, and target cell-limited models with delayed virus production, demonstrating its superiority in capturing the shape of parameter distributions. Furthermore, we applied EPD to real-world datasets, capturing various shapes of parameter distributions rather than a normal distribution. These results effectively address the heterogeneity within systems, marking a substantial progression in accurately modeling systems using RCS data.">

        <tr id="We consider the problem of making nonparametric inference in multi-dimensional diffusion models from low-frequency data. Statistical analysis in this setting is notoriously challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood and its gradient, and computational methods have thus far largely resorted to expensive simulation-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new computational approach which is motivated by PDE theory and is built around the characterisation of the transition densities as solutions of the associated heat (Fokker-Planck) equation. Employing optimal regularity results from the theory of parabolic PDEs, we prove a novel characterisation for the gradient of the likelihood. Using these developments, for the nonlinear inverse problem of recovering the diffusivity (in divergence form models), we then show that the numerical evaluation of the likelihood and its gradient can be reduced to standard elliptic eigenvalue problems, solvable by powerful finite element methods. This enables the efficient implementation of a large class of statistical algorithms, including (i) preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and Langevin-type methods for posterior sampling, and (ii) gradient-based descent optimisation schemes to compute maximum likelihood and maximum-a-posteriori estimates. We showcase the effectiveness of these methods via extensive simulation studies in a nonparametric Bayesian model with Gaussian process priors. Interestingly, the optimisation schemes provided satisfactory numerical recovery while exhibiting rapid convergence towards stationary points despite the problem nonlinearity; thus our approach may lead to significant computational speed-ups.

This paper proposes a state-space model for time-varying functions to extract trends and serial dependence from functional time series while imposing the shape constraints on the estimated functions. The function of interest is modeled by a convex combination of selected basis functions to satisfy the shape constraints, where the time-varying convex weights on simplex follow the dynamic multi-logit models. For the complicated likelihood of this model, a novel data augmentation technique is devised to enable posterior computation by an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The proposed method is applied to the estimation of time-varying Lorenz curves, and its utility is illustrated through numerical experiments and analysis of panel data of household incomes in Japan.">

Recent advances have shown how to use random feature approximations to achieve scalable, online ensembling of Gaussian processes with desirable theoretical properties and fruitful applications. One key to these methods' success is the inclusion of a random walk on the model parameters, which makes models dynamic. We show that these methods can be generalized easily to any basis expansion model and that using alternative basis expansions, such as Hilbert space Gaussian processes, often results in better performance. To simplify the process of choosing a specific basis expansion, our method's generality also allows the ensembling of several entirely different models, for example, a Gaussian process and polynomial regression. Finally, we propose a novel method to ensemble static and dynamic models together.">

Multi-fidelity methods provide a solution by chaining models in a hierarchy with increasing fidelity, associated with lower error, but increasing cost. In this paper, we compare different multi-fidelity methods employed in constructing Gaussian process surrogates for regression. Non-linear autoregressive methods in the existing literature are primarily confined to two-fidelity models, and we extend these methods to handle more than two levels of fidelity. Additionally, we propose enhancements for an existing method incorporating delay terms by introducing a structured kernel. We demonstrate the performance of these methods across various academic and real-world scenarios. Our findings reveal that multi-fidelity methods generally have a smaller prediction error for the same computational cost as compared to the single-fidelity method, although their effectiveness varies across different scenarios.">

Finite element (FE) models allow for more efficient behavioral prediction, but often require onerous setup, especially for large systems. We present a physics-informed neural network model formed by combining a low fidelity analytical model and input-convex neural networks to learn an underlying energy potential for the actuator from experimental and finite element simulation data. In doing this, the neural network can provide sufficiently accurate predictions about systems made up of multiple units, essentially scaling the model from a single unit to an assembly of many. To test this concept, we compare predictions of the deformation of a 5-actuator system from an FE model and from the physics-informed neural network. The neural network, which provides a prediction similar in accuracy to the FE equivalent, can more easily be adjusted to execute systems of greater quantities of units without drastic increases in computational consumption. In this way, we can scale our predictive understanding with adequate accuracy without compounding resources.">

Here, we show that they are the universal limit for the sharpness of any input-output response arising from a Markov process model at thermodynamic equilibrium. Models may represent arbitrary molecular complexity, with multiple ligands, internal states, conformations, co-regulators, etc, under core assumptions that are detailed in the paper. The model output may be any linear combination of steady-state probabilities, with components other than the chosen input ligand held constant. This formulation generalises most of the responses in the literature. We use a coarse-graining method in the graph-theoretic linear framework to show that two sharpness measures for input-output responses fall within an effectively bounded region of the positive quadrant, Ωm ⊂ (ℝ+)2, for any equilibrium model with m input binding sites. Ωm exhibits a cusp which approaches, but never exceeds, the sharpness of ℋm but the region and the cusp can be exceeded when models are taken away from thermodynamic equilibrium. Such fundamental thermodynamic limits are called Hopfield barriers and our results provide a biophysical justification for the Hill functions as the universal Hopfield barriers for sharpness. Our results also introduce an object, Ωm, whose structure may be of mathematical interest, and suggest the importance of characterising Hopfield barriers for other forms of cellular information processing.">

        <tr id="Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learn- ing models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irreg- ular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based mod- els, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experi- ments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.">

Moreover, with the trajectory probability analysis, we present a novel feedback-controlled KMC algorithm that accurately captures the dynamics systems controlled by external signal based on measurements of the system's state.

        <tr id="Learning from expert demonstrations to flexibly program an autonomous system with complex behaviors or to predict an agent's behavior is a powerful tool, especially in collaborative control settings. A common method to solve this problem is inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), where the observed agent, e.g., a human demonstrator, is assumed to behave according to the optimization of an intrinsic cost function that reflects its intent and informs its control actions. While the framework is expressive, it is also computationally demanding and generally lacks convergence guarantees. We therefore propose a novel, stability-certified IRL approach by reformulating the cost function inference problem to learning control Lyapunov functions (CLF) from demonstrations data. By additionally exploiting closed-form expressions for associated control policies, we are able to efficiently search the space of CLFs by observing the attractor landscape of the induced dynamics. For the construction of the inverse optimal CLFs, we use a Sum of Squares and formulate a convex optimization problem. We present a theoretical analysis of the optimality properties provided by the CLF and evaluate our approach using both simulated and real-world data.">

        <tr id="Despite the effectiveness of deep neural networks in numerous natural language processing applications, recent findings have exposed the vulnerability of these language models when minor perturbations are introduced. While appearing semantically indistinguishable to humans, these perturbations can significantly reduce the performance of well-trained language models, raising concerns about the reliability of deploying them in safe-critical situations. In this work, we construct a computationally efficient self-healing process to correct undesired model behavior during online inference when perturbations are applied to input data. This is formulated as a trajectory optimization problem in which the internal states of the neural network layers are automatically corrected using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control mechanism. The P controller targets immediate state adjustments, while the I and D controllers consider past states and future dynamical trends, respectively. We leverage the geometrical properties of the training data to design effective linear PID controllers. This approach reduces the computational cost to that of using just the P controller, instead of the full PID control. Further, we introduce an analytical method for approximating the optimal control solutions, enhancing the real-time inference capabilities of this controlled system. Moreover, we conduct a theoretical error analysis of the analytic solution in a simplified setting. The proposed PID control-based self-healing is a low cost framework that improves the robustness of pre-trained large language models, whether standard or robustly trained, against a wide range of perturbations.

The generation of eddies is a major contributor to atmospheric turbulence, similar in geometric structure to optical vortices that sit at the centre of OAM beams. Decomposing the received optical fields into OAM provides a unique spatial similarity that can be used to analyse turbulent channels. In this work, we present a novel mode decomposition assisted machine learning approach that reveals trainable features in the distortions of vortex beams that allow for effective environmental monitoring. This novel technique can be used reliably with Support Vector Machine regression models to measure temperature variations of 0.49C and wind speed variations of 0.029 m/s over a 36m experimental turbulent free-space channels with controllable and verifiable temperature and wind speed with short 3s measurement.

        <tr id="A heated and challenging area of fault diagnostic research has been separating the rolling bearing problem feature information from severe noise disruption. The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) has been effectively applied to rolling bearings with the advantage that it does not involve the subjective definition of parameters and eliminates noise when efficiently reconstructing the modes. However, it possesses the following shortcomings the invalid symplectic geometry component (SGC) affects the decomposition accuracy, and the physical meaning of the decomposition results is unclear. Inspired by nonparametric adaptive signal decomposition methods such as SGMD and matching pursuit (MP), the article proposes the symplectic sparsest mode decomposition (SSMD) method. SSMD first constructs a library of symplectic geometry atoms and constrains the number of atoms by energy threshold, which effectively improves the decomposition speed; then, the quality of atoms and the robustness of the algorithm are improved by initialized adaptive noise reduction of symplectic geometry atoms; finally, symplectic geometry atoms are optimally reconstructed by genetic algorithms with the regularized locally narrowband operator as the optimization target, which obtains the sparsest solution of symplectic geometry mode components while constraining the decomposition result to be locally narrowband signals, so as to make better physical meaning of decomposition results. The comparative analysis results of simulation and experiment show that SSMD has obvious advantages in decomposition accuracy and noise robustness, and is more efficient relative to the decomposition of SGMD.">

 This technical brief makes use of the concept of symbolic time series analysis (STSA) for identifying discrete states from the non-linear time response of a chaotic dynamical for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) control. Along this line, a projection-based method is adopted to construct probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA) for identification of the current state (i.e., operational regime) of the Lorenz system; and a (Q-map-based and model-free) RL control strategy is formulated to reach the target state from the (identified) current state. A synergistic combination of PFSA-based state identification and RL control is demonstrated by simulation of a numeric model of the Lorenz system, which yields very satisfactory performance to reach the target states from the current states in real time.">

        <tr id="Complex network analysis methods have been widely applied to nonlinear systems, but applications within fluid mechanics are relatively few. In this paper, we use a network for the Lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor (VGT), where each node is a flow state, and the probability of transitioning between states follows from a direct numerical simulation of statistically steady and isotropic turbulence. The network representation of the VGT dynamics is much more compact than the continuous, joint distribution of a set of invariants for the tensor. We focus on choosing optimal variables to discretize and classify the VGT states. To this end, we test several classifications based on topology and various properties of the background flow coherent structures. We do this using the notion of"community"or"module", namely clusters of nodes that are optimally distinct while also containing diverse nodal functions. The best classification based upon VGT invariants often adopted in the literature combines the sign of the principal invariants, $Q$ and $R$, and the sign of the discriminant function, $\Delta$, separating regions where the VGT eigenvalues are real and complex. We further improve this classification by including the relative magnitude of the non-normal contribution to the dynamics of the enstrophy and straining stemming from a Schur decomposition of the VGT. The traditional focus on the second VGT principal invariant, $Q$, implies consideration of the difference between the enstrophy and strain-rate magnitude without the non-normal parts. The fact that including the non-normality leads to a better VGT classification highlights the importance of unclosed and complex terms contributing to the VGT dynamics, namely the pressure Hessian and viscous terms, to which the VGT non-normality is intrinsically related.">

By viewing the cost function as a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two Markov chains, we bring the tools from variational inference to bear on our optimal control problem. This allows for deriving a dynamic programming principle, where the value function is defined as a KL divergence again. We then resort to Gaussian distributions to approximate the control policies, and apply the theory to control affine nonlinear systems with quadratic costs. This results in closed-form recursive updates, which generalize LQR control and the backward Riccati equation. We illustrate this novel method on the simple problem of stabilizing an inverted pendulum.">

        <tr id="The core of a good model is in its ability to focus only on important information that reflects the basic patterns and consistencies, thus pulling out a clear, noise-free signal from the dataset. This necessitates using a simplified model defined by fewer parameters. The importance of theoretical foundations becomes clear in this context, as this paper relies on established results from the domain of advanced sparse optimization, particularly those addressing nonlinear differentiable functions. The need for such theoretical foundations is further highlighted by the trend that as computational power for training NNs increases, so does the complexity of the models in terms of a higher number of parameters. In practical scenarios, these large models are often simplified to more manageable versions with fewer parameters. Understanding why these simplified models with less number of parameters remain effective raises a crucial question. Understanding why these simplified models with fewer parameters remain effective raises an important question. This leads to the broader question of whether there is a theoretical framework that can clearly explain these empirical observations. Recent developments, such as establishing necessary conditions for the convergence of iterative hard thresholding (IHT) to a sparse local minimum (a sparse method analogous to gradient descent) are promising. The remarkable capacity of the IHT algorithm to accurately identify and learn the locations of nonzero parameters underscores its practical effectiveness and utility. This paper aims to investigate whether the theoretical prerequisites for such convergence are applicable in the realm of neural network (NN) training by providing justification for all the necessary conditions for convergence. Then, these conditions are validated by experiments on a single-layer NN, using the IRIS dataset as a testbed.">

If these systems are Hamiltonian systems their physical structure should be preserved during the reduction, which can be ensured by applying symplectic basis generation techniques such as the complex SVD (cSVD). Recently, randomized symplectic methods such as the randomized complex singular value decomposition (rcSVD) have been developed for a more efficient computation of symplectic bases that preserve the Hamiltonian structure during MOR. In the current paper, we present two error bounds for the rcSVD basis depending on the choice of hyperparameters and show that with a proper choice of hyperparameters, the projection error of rcSVD is at most a constant factor worse than the projection error of cSVD. We provide numerical experiments that demonstrate the efficiency of randomized symplectic basis generation and compare the bounds numerically.">

However, in practice, both designing systems of CTRNN to have a certain output, and the reverse-understanding the dynamics of a given system of CTRNN-can be nontrivial. In this article, we describe a method for embedding any specified Turing machine in its entirety into a CTRNN. As such, we describe in detail a continuous time dynamical system that performs arbitrary discrete-state computations. We suggest that in acting as both a continuous time dynamical system and as a computer, the study of such systems can help refine and advance the debate concerning the Computational Hypothesis that cognition is a form of computation and the Dynamical Hypothesis that cognitive systems are dynamical systems.">

Specifically, the constraints imposed on the nonlinear systems' input could be symmetric or asymmetric. Initially, to tackle such constraints, we construct a novel nonquadratic cost function for the constrained auxiliary system. Then, we propose a dynamic event-triggering mechanism relied on the time-based variable and the system states simultaneously for cutting down the computational load. Meanwhile, we show that the robust dynamic EDC of original nonlinear-constrained systems could be acquired by solving the event-driven optimal control problem of the constrained auxiliary system. After that, we develop the corresponding event-driven Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and then solve it through a unique critic neural network (CNN) in the reinforcement learning framework. To relax the persistence of excitation condition in tuning CNN's weights, we incorporate experience replay into the gradient descent method. With the aid of Lyapunov's approach, we prove that the closed-loop auxiliary system and the weight estimation error are uniformly ultimately bounded stable. Finally, two examples, including a nonlinear plant and the pendulum system, are utilized to validate the theoretical claims.">

However, their time and memory complexities scale prohibitively with the size of the state space. This is particularly problematic in spatiotemporal regression problems, where the state dimension scales with the number of spatial observations. Existing approximate frameworks leverage low-rank approximations of the covariance matrix. Since they do not model the error introduced by the computational approximation, their predictive uncertainty estimates can be overly optimistic. In this work, we propose a probabilistic numerical method for inference in high-dimensional Gauss-Markov models which mitigates these scaling issues. Our matrix-free iterative algorithm leverages GPU acceleration and crucially enables a tunable trade-off between computational cost and predictive uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method on a large-scale climate dataset.">

        <tr id="Although the raison d'etre of the brain is the survival of the body, there are relatively few theoretical studies of closed-loop rhythmic motor control systems. In this paper we provide a unified framework, based on variational analysis, for investigating the dual goals of performance and robustness in powerstroke-recovery systems. We augment two previously published closed-loop motor control models by equipping each model with a performance measure based on the rate of progress of the system relative to a spatially extended external substrate -- such as progress relative to the ground for a locomotor task. The sensitivity measure quantifies the ability of the system to maintain performance in response to external perturbations. Motivated by a search for optimal design principles for feedback control achieving the complementary requirements of efficiency and robustness, we discuss the performance-sensitivity patterns of the systems featuring different sensory feedback architectures. In a paradigmatic half-center oscillator (HCO)-motor system, we observe that the excitation-inhibition property of feedback mechanisms determines the sensitivity pattern while the activation-inactivation property determines the performance pattern. Moreover, we show that the nonlinearity of the sigmoid activation of feedback signals allows the existence of optimal combinations of performance and sensitivity. In a detailed hindlimb locomotor system, we find that a force-dependent feedback can simultaneously optimize both performance and robustness, while length-dependent feedback variations result in significant performance-versus-sensitivity tradeoffs. Thus, this work provides an analytical framework for studying feedback control of oscillations in nonlinear dynamical systems, leading to several insights that have the potential to inform the design of control or rehabilitation systems.">

        <tr id="The traditional Kalman filter (KF) is widely applied in control systems, but it relies heavily on the accuracy of the system model and noise parameters, leading to potential performance degradation when facing inaccuracies. To address this issue, introducing neural networks into the KF framework offers a data-driven solution to compensate for these inaccuracies, improving the filter's performance while maintaining interpretability. Nevertheless, existing studies mostly employ recurrent neural network (RNN), which fails to fully capture the dependencies among state sequences and lead to an unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm named the attention Kalman filter (AtKF), which incorporates a self-attention network to capture the dependencies among state sequences. To address the instability in the recursive training process, a parallel pre-training strategy is devised. Specifically, this strategy involves piecewise linearizing the system via lattice trajectory piecewise linear (LTPWL) expression, and generating pre-training data through a batch estimation algorithm, which exploits the self-attention mechanism's parallel processing ability. Experimental results on a two-dimensional nonlinear system demonstrate that AtKF outperforms other filters under noise disturbances and model mismatches.">

        <tr id="There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic, stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory, a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map. Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

We propose a particle‐filter‐based method that incorporates nudging techniques inspired by optimization algorithms in machine learning by taking advantage of the flexibility of the proposal density in particle filtering. However, as the model resolution and number of observations increase, filter degeneracy tends to be the obstacle to implementing the particle filter. Therefore, this proposed method is combined with the implicit equal‐weights particle filter (IEWPF), in which all particle weights are equal. The method is validated using the 1000‐dimensional linear model with an additive parameter and the 1000‐dimensional Lorenz‐96 model, where the forcing term is parameterized. The method is shown to be capable of resilient and efficient parameter estimation for parameter changes over time in our application with a linear observation operator.

The nonsmooth dynamical system is described by an evolution variational inequality and we derive the continuity equation associated with this system class using three different formalisms. The first formalism consists of using the {superposition principle} to describe the continuity equation for a measure that disintegrates into a probability measure supported on the set of vector fields and another measure representing the distribution of system trajectories at each time instant. The second formalism is based on the regularization of the nonsmooth vector field and describing the measure as the limit of a sequence of measures associated with the regularization parameter. In doing so, we obtain quantitative bounds on the Wasserstein metric between measure solutions of the regularized vector field and the limiting measure associated with the nonsmooth vector field. The third formalism uses a time-stepping algorithm to model a time-discretized evolution of the measures and show that the absolutely continuous trajectories associated with the continuity equation are recovered in the limit as the sampling time goes to zero. We also validate each formalism with numerical examples. For the first formalism, we use polynomial optimization techniques and the moment-SOS hierarchy to obtain approximate moments of the measures. For the second formalism, we illustrate the bounds on the Wasserstein metric for an academic example for which the closed-form expression of the Wasserstein metric can be calculated. For the third formalism, we illustrate the time-stepping based algorithm for measure evolution on an example that shows the effect of the concentration of measures.">

To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called"seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.">

        <tr id="Dynamics of many complex systems, from weather and climate to spread of infectious diseases, can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Such PDEs involve unknown function(s), partial derivatives, and typically multiple independent variables. The traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs assume that the data are observed on a regular grid. However, in many applications, for example, weather and air pollution monitoring delivered by the arbitrary located weather stations of the National Weather Services, data records are irregularly spaced. Furthermore, in problems involving prediction analytics such as forecasting wildfire smoke plumes, the primary focus may be on a set of irregular locations associated with urban development. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods and, in particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a new promising tool that can complement traditional PDE solvers in scenarios of the irregular spaced data, contributing to the newest research trend of physics informed machine learning (PIML). However, most existing PIML methods tend to be limited in their ability to describe higher dimensional structural properties exhibited by real world phenomena, especially, ones that live on manifolds. To address this fundamental challenge, we bring the elements of the Hodge theory and, in particular, simplicial convolution defined on the Hodge Laplacian to the emerging nexus of DL and PDEs. In contrast to conventional Laplacian and the associated convolution operation, the simplicial convolution allows us to rigorously describe diffusion across higher order structures and to better approximate the complex underlying topology and geometry of the data. The new approach, Simplicial Neural Networks for Partial Differential Equations (SNN PDE) offers a computationally efficient yet effective solution for time dependent PDEs. Our studies of a broad range of synthetic data and wildfire processes demonstrate that SNN PDE improves upon state of the art baselines in handling unstructured grids and irregular time intervals of complex physical systems and offers competitive forecasting capabilities for weather and air quality forecasting.">

This paper primarily focuses on reconstructing linear dynamic system models based on destination constraints in the set-valued framework. We treat destination constraints as inherent information in the state evolution process and employ convex optimization techniques to construct a coherent and robust state model. This refined model effectively captures the impact of destination constraints on the state evolution at each time step. Furthermore, we design an optimal weight matrix for the reconstructed model to ensure smoother and more natural trajectories of state evolution. We also analyze the theoretical guarantee of optimality for this weight matrix and the properties of the reconstructed model. Finally, simulation experiments verify that the reconstructed model has significant advantages over the unconstrained and unoptimized weighted models and constrains the evolution of state trajectories with different starting and ending points.">

We here propose the use of a real-world problem, involving the reconstruction of the structure of flights in the US air transport system from the activity of individual airports, as a way to explore the limits of such an approach. While the true connectivity is known and is, therefore, possible to provide a quantitative benchmark, this problem presents challenges commonly found in other fields, including the presence of non-stationarities and observational noise, and the limitedness of available time series. We explore the impact of elements like the specific functional metric employed, the way of detrending the time series, or the size of the reconstructed system and discuss how the conclusions here drawn could have implications for similar analyses in neuroscience.">

        <tr id="Dynamic models generating time‐dependent model predictions are typically associated with high‐dimensional input spaces and high‐dimensional output spaces, in particular if time is discretized. It is computationally prohibitive to apply traditional global sensitivity analysis (SA) separately on each time output, as is common in the literature on multivariate SA. As an alternative, we propose a novel method for efficient global SA of dynamic models with high‐dimensional inputs by combining a new polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)‐driven partial least squares (PLS) algorithm with the analysis of variance. PLS is used to simultaneously reduce the dimensionality of the input and output variables spaces, by identifying the input and output latent variables that account for most of their joint variability. PCE is incorporated into the PLS algorithm to capture the non‐linear behavior of the physical system. We derive the sensitivity indices associated with each output latent variable, based on which we propose generalized sensitivity indices that synthesize the influence of each input on the variance of entire output time series. All sensitivities can be computed analytically by post‐processing the coefficients of the PLS‐PCE representation. Hence, the computational cost of global SA for dynamic models essentially reduces to the cost for estimating these coefficients. We numerically compare the proposed method with existing methods by several dynamic models with high‐dimensional inputs. The results show that the PLS‐PCE method can obtain accurate sensitivity indices at low computational cost, even for models with strong interaction among the inputs.">

        <tr id="The growing availability and importance of time series data across various domains, including environmental science, epidemiology, and economics, has led to an increasing need for time-series causal discovery methods that can identify the intricate relationships in the non-stationary, non-linear, and often noisy real world data. However, the majority of current time series causal discovery methods assume stationarity and linear relations in data, making them infeasible for the task. Further, the recent deep learning-based methods rely on the traditional causal structure learning approaches making them computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a Time-Series Causal Neural Network (TS-CausalNN) - a deep learning technique to discover contemporaneous and lagged causal relations simultaneously. Our proposed architecture comprises (i) convolutional blocks comprising parallel custom causal layers, (ii) acyclicity constraint, and (iii) optimization techniques using the augmented Lagrangian approach. In addition to the simple parallel design, an advantage of the proposed model is that it naturally handles the non-stationarity and non-linearity of the data. Through experiments on multiple synthetic and real world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical proficiency of our proposed approach as compared to several state-of-the-art methods. The inferred graphs for the real world dataset are in good agreement with the domain understanding.">

Estimating high-dimensional probability distributions from data samples suffers from an optimization and an approximation curse of dimensionality. It may be avoided by following a hierarchic probability flow from coarse to fine scales. This inverse renormalization group is defined by conditional probabilities across scales, renormalized in a wavelet basis. For a $\varphi^4$ scalar potential, sampling these hierarchic models avoids the critical slowing down at the phase transition. An outstanding issue is to also approximate non-Gaussian fields having long-range interactions in space and across scales. We introduce low-dimensional models with robust multiscale approximations of high order polynomial energies. They are calculated with a second wavelet transform, which defines interactions over two hierarchies of scales. We estimate and sample these wavelet scattering models to generate 2D vorticity fields of turbulence, and images of dark matter densities.">

In particular, fixed-gain control offers more predictable closed-loop system behavior but requires the knowledge of uncertainty bounds. In contrast, while adaptive learning does not necessarily require such knowledge, it often results in less predictable closed-loop system behavior compared to fixed-gain control. To this end, this paper presents a novel symbiotic control framework that offers the strengths of fixed-gain control and adaptive learning architectures. Specifically, this framework synergistically integrates these architectures to mitigate the effects of uncertainties in a more predictable manner as compared to adaptive learning alone and it does not require any knowledge on such uncertainties. Both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties are considered, where we utilize neural networks to approximate the unknown uncertainty basis for the latter case. Counterintuitively, the proposed framework has the ability to achieve a desired level of closed-loop system behavior even with an insufficient number of neurons (e.g., when the neural network approximation error is large) or in the face of injudiciously selected adaptive learning parameters (e.g., high leakage term parameters).">

        <tr id="Real-world data typically exhibit aleatoric uncertainty which has to be considered during data-driven decision-making to assess the confidence of the decision provided by machine learning models. To propagate aleatoric uncertainty represented by probability distributions (PDs) through neural networks (NNs), both sampling-based and function approximation-based methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from significant approximation errors and are not able to accurately represent predictive uncertainty in the NN output. In this paper, we present a novel method, Piecewise Linear Transformation (PLT), for propagating PDs through NNs with piecewise linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU NNs). PLT does not require sampling or specific assumptions about the PDs. Instead, it harnesses the piecewise linear structure of such NNs to determine the propagated PD in the output space. In this way, PLT supports the accurate quantification of predictive uncertainty based on the criterion exactness of the propagated PD. We assess this exactness in theory by showing error bounds for our propagated PD. Further, our experimental evaluation validates that PLT outperforms competing methods on publicly available real-world classification and regression datasets regarding exactness. Thus, the PDs propagated by PLT allow to assess the uncertainty of the provided decisions, offering valuable support.">

The algorithm is derived by combining a proximal method of multipliers (PMM) with a standard semismooth Newton method (SSN), and is shown to be globally convergent under minimal assumptions. Further local linear (and potentially superlinear) convergence is shown under standard additional conditions. The major computational bottleneck of the proposed approach arises from the solution of the associated SSN linear systems. These are solved using a Krylov-subspace method, accelerated by certain novel general-purpose preconditioners which are shown to be optimal with respect to the proximal penalty parameters. The preconditioners are easy to store and invert, since they exploit the structure of the nonsmooth terms appearing in the problem's objective to significantly reduce their memory requirements. We showcase the efficiency, robustness, and scalability of the proposed solver on a variety of problems arising in risk-averse portfolio selection, $L^1$-regularized partial differential equation constrained optimization, quantile regression, and binary classification via linear support vector machines.

        <tr id="Homeostasis is concerned with regulatory mechanisms, present in biological systems, where some specific variable is kept close to a set value as some external disturbance affects the system. Mathematically, the notion of homeostasis can be formalized in terms of an input-output function that maps the parameter representing the external disturbance to the output variable that must be kept within a fairly narrow range. This observation inspired the introduction of the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis, namely, the derivative of the input-output function is zero at an isolated point. This point of view allows for the application of methods from singularity theory to characterize infinitesimal homeostasis points (i.e. critical points of the input-output function). In this paper we review the infinitesimal approach to the study of homeostasis in input-output networks. An input-output network is a network with two distinguished nodes `input' and `output', and the dynamics of the network determines the corresponding input-output function of the system. This class of dynamical systems provides an appropriate framework to study homeostasis and several important biological systems can be formulated in this context. Moreover, this approach, coupled to graph-theoretic ideas from combinatorial matrix theory, provides a systematic way for classifying different types of homeostasis (homeostatic mechanisms) in input-output networks, in terms of the network topology. In turn, this leads to new mathematical concepts, such as, homeostasis subnetworks, homeostasis patterns, homeostasis mode interaction. We illustrate the usefulness of this theory with several biological examples: biochemical networks, chemical reaction networks (CRN), gene regulatory networks (GRN), Intracellular metal ion regulation and so on.">

While prior works in optimization theory have derived optimal metrics for limited classes of problems, the results do not extend to many practical problem forms including general Quadratic Programming (QP). This paper shows how differentiable optimization can enable the end-to-end learning of proximal metrics, enhancing the convergence of proximal algorithms for QP problems beyond what is possible based on known theory. Additionally, the results illustrate a strong connection between the learned proximal metrics and active constraints at the optima, leading to an interpretation in which the learning of proximal metrics can be viewed as a form of active set learning.">

Those two techniques are based on a stochastic argument and thus will only enforce conservativeness up to a user-defined probability threshold.

We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments on artificial problems.

Based on the Liouville equation associated with the stochastic dynamical systems, a new temporal KRnet (tKRnet) is proposed to approximate the probability density functions (PDFs) of the state variables. The tKRnet gives an explicit density model for the solution of the Liouville equation, which alleviates the curse of dimensionality issue that limits the application of traditional grid based numerical methods. To efficiently train the tKRnet, an adaptive procedure is developed to generate collocation points for the corresponding residual loss function, where samples are generated iteratively using the approximate density function at each iteration. A temporal decomposition technique is also employed to improve the long-time integration. Theoretical analysis of our proposed method is provided, and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate its performance.">

However, common challenges in modeling data with GPLVMs include inadequate kernel flexibility and improper selection of the projection noise, which leads to a type of model collapse characterized primarily by vague latent representations that do not reflect the underlying structure of the data. This paper addresses these issues by, first, theoretically examining the impact of the projection variance on model collapse through the lens of a linear GPLVM. Second, we address the problem of model collapse due to inadequate kernel flexibility by integrating the spectral mixture (SM) kernel and a differentiable random Fourier feature (RFF) kernel approximation, which ensures computational scalability and efficiency through off-the-shelf automatic differentiation tools for learning the kernel hyperparameters, projection variance, and latent representations within the variational inference framework. The proposed GPLVM, named advisedRFLVM, is evaluated across diverse datasets and consistently outperforms various salient competing models, including state-of-the-art variational autoencoders (VAEs) and GPLVM variants, in terms of informative latent representations and missing data imputation.">

        <tr id="In complex systems with multiple variables monitored at high‐frequency, variables are not only temporally autocorrelated, but they may also be nonlinearly related or exhibit nonstationarity as the inputs or operation changes. One approach to handling such variables is to detrend them prior to monitoring and then apply control charts that assume independence and stationarity to the residuals. Monitoring controlled systems is even more challenging because the control strategy seeks to maintain variables at prespecified mean levels, and to compensate, correlations among variables may change, making monitoring the covariance essential. In this paper, a vector autoregressive model (VAR) is compared with a multivariate random forest (MRF) and a neural network (NN) for detrending multivariate time series prior to monitoring the covariance of the residuals using a multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) control chart. Machine learning models have an advantage when the data's structure is unknown or may change. We design a novel simulation study with nonlinear, nonstationary, and autocorrelated data to compare the different detrending models and subsequent covariance monitoring. The machine learning models have superior performance for nonlinear and strongly autocorrelated data and similar performance for linear data. An illustration with data from a reverse osmosis process is given.">

State-of-the-art structure learning methods for this setting have at least one of the following shortcomings: i) they cannot provide optimality guarantees and can suffer from learning sub-optimal models; ii) they rely on the stringent assumption that the noise is homoscedastic, and hence the underlying model is fully identifiable. We overcome these shortcomings and develop a computationally efficient mixed-integer programming framework for learning medium-sized problems that accounts for arbitrary heteroscedastic noise. We present an early stopping criterion under which we can terminate the branch-and-bound procedure to achieve an asymptotically optimal solution and establish the consistency of this approximate solution. In addition, we show via numerical experiments that our method outperforms three state-of-the-art algorithms and is robust to noise heteroscedasticity, whereas the performance of the competing methods deteriorates under strong violations of the identifiability assumption.

        <tr id="Scientific advancement is universally based on the dynamic interplay between theoretical insights, modelling, and experimental discoveries. However, this feedback loop is often slow, including delayed community interactions and the gradual integration of experimental data into theoretical frameworks. This challenge is particularly exacerbated in domains dealing with high-dimensional object spaces, such as molecules and complex microstructures. Hence, the integration of theory within automated and autonomous experimental setups, or theory in the loop automated experiment, is emerging as a crucial objective for accelerating scientific research. The critical aspect is not only to use theory but also on-the-fly theory updates during the experiment. Here, we introduce a method for integrating theory into the loop through Bayesian co-navigation of theoretical model space and experimentation. Our approach leverages the concurrent development of surrogate models for both simulation and experimental domains at the rates determined by latencies and costs of experiments and computation, alongside the adjustment of control parameters within theoretical models to minimize epistemic uncertainty over the experimental object spaces. This methodology facilitates the creation of digital twins of material structures, encompassing both the surrogate model of behavior that includes the correlative part and the theoretical model itself. While demonstrated here within the context of functional responses in ferroelectric materials, our approach holds promise for broader applications, the exploration of optical properties in nanoclusters, microstructure-dependent properties in complex materials, and properties of molecular systems.

For this, we investigate some regularity properties of the solution in certain function classes for a neural network approximation, verifying the sufficient condition for the solution to have the desired regularity.

However, the fault detection model for multirate data faces challenges in handling irregular data, complex modeling, and poor generalization capabilities. To effectively use and regularize multirate data and enhance detection models, this article proposes a multiscale hierarchical fault detection (MsHFD) model. This innovative model integrates and reconstructs irregular multirate data into multiscale data, progressively advancing through different scales, and uses variational autoencoder (VAE) for nonlinear feature extraction. The hierarchical model not only preserves data change trends but also incrementally incorporates variable relationships, thereby improving detection efficiency and providing a foundation for faulty variable identification. Finally, comparative experiments with traditional linear models and nonprobabilistic deep models demonstrate that the proposed model in multiphase flow (MPF) process achieves superior fault detection performance.">

The method interleaves a goal-oriented active learning algorithm selecting evaluation points and tolerances based on the expected impact on the Kullback-Leibler divergence of surrogated and true posterior with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior.

When used with carefully constructed Taylor-Verlet integrators, Verlet flows provide exact-likelihood generative models which generalize coupled flow architectures from a non-continuous setting while imposing minimal expressivity constraints. On experiments over toy densities, we demonstrate that the variance of the commonly used Hutchinson trace estimator is unsuitable for importance sampling, whereas Verlet flows perform comparably to full autograd trace computations while being significantly faster.">

Traditional derivative-free optimization techniques often rely on strong assumptions about objective functions, thereby failing at optimizing non-convex systems beyond 100 dimensions. Here, we present a tree search method for derivative-free optimization that enables accelerated optimal design of high-dimensional complex systems. Specifically, we introduce stochastic tree expansion, dynamic upper confidence bound, and short-range backpropagation mechanism to evade local optimum, iteratively approximating the global optimum using machine learning models. This development effectively confronts the dimensionally challenging problems, achieving convergence to global optima across various benchmark functions up to 2,000 dimensions, surpassing the existing methods by 10- to 20-fold. Our method demonstrates wide applicability to a wide range of real-world complex systems spanning materials, physics, and biology, considerably outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. This enables efficient autonomous knowledge discovery and facilitates self-driving virtual laboratories.

The novelty of the paper is that it gives strict criteria for selecting optimal collective variables via the properties of the effective dynamics. In particular, we show that the transition density of the effective dynamics of the optimal collective variable solves a relative entropy minimization problem from certain family of densities to the transition density of $X_n$. We also show that many transfer operator-based data-driven numerical approaches essentially learn quantities of the effective dynamics. Furthermore, we obtain various error estimates for the effective dynamics in approximating dominant timescales / eigenvalues and transition rates of the original process $X_n$ and how optimal collective variables minimize these errors. Our results contribute to the development of theoretical tools for the understanding of complex dynamical systems, e.g. molecular kinetics, on large timescales.

Novel approaches from machine learning to solve differential equations could provide a more generic way to find coarse level models for parallel-in-time algorithms. This paper demonstrates that a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator (PINO) is an effective coarse model for the parallelization in time of the two-asset Black-Scholes equation using Parareal. We demonstrate that PINO-Parareal converges as fast as a bespoke numerical coarse model and that, in combination with spatial parallelization by domain decomposition, it provides better overall speedup than both purely spatial parallelization and space-time parallelizaton with a numerical coarse propagator.">

        <tr id="Bayesian linear inverse problems aim to recover an unknown signal from noisy observations, incorporating prior knowledge. This paper analyses a data dependent method to choose the scale parameter of a Gaussian prior. The method we study arises from early stopping methods, which have been successfully applied to a range of problems for statistical inverse problems in the frequentist setting. These results are extended to the Bayesian setting. We study the use of a discrepancy based stopping rule in the setting of random noise. Our proposed stopping rule results in optimal rates under certain conditions on the prior covariance operator. We furthermore derive for which class of signals this method is adaptive. It is also shown that the associated posterior contracts at the optimal rate and provides a conservative measure of uncertainty. We implement the proposed stopping rule using the continuous-time ensemble Kalman--Bucy filter (EnKBF). The fictitious time parameter replaces the scale parameter, and the ensemble size is appropriately adjusted in order to not lose statistical optimality of the computed estimator. The EnKBF, then, gives a continuous process from the prior distribution to the posterior which is terminated using the proposed stopping rule.">

        <tr id="Mean-field control (MFC) problems aim to find the optimal policy to control massive populations of interacting agents. These problems are crucial in areas such as economics, physics, and biology. We consider the non-local setting, where the interactions between agents are governed by a suitable kernel. For $N$ agents, the interaction cost has $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity, which can be prohibitively slow to evaluate and differentiate when $N$ is large. To this end, we propose an efficient primal-dual algorithm that utilizes basis expansions of the kernels. The basis expansions reduce the cost of computing the interactions, while the primal-dual methodology decouples the agents at the expense of solving for a moderate number of dual variables. We also demonstrate that our approach can further be structured in a multi-resolution manner, where we estimate optimal dual variables using a moderate $N$ and solve decoupled trajectory optimization problems for large $N$. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on an optimal control of 5000 interacting quadrotors.">

        <tr id="Effective learning in neuronal networks requires the adaptation of individual synapses given their relative contribution to solving a task. However, physical neuronal systems -- whether biological or artificial -- are constrained by spatio-temporal locality. How such networks can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In Machine Learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space (BP) and time (BPTT). However, BP(TT) is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatiotemporal (non-)locality, while forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) suffer from prohibitive memory constraints. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of BPTT in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, performing an effective spatiotemporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint states necessary for useful parameter updates.">

However, it was initially designed to run in a single-core processor, accessing the whole input dataset. The surge in data volumes, coupled with the increase in parallel hardware architectures and specialised frameworks, has led to a growth in interest and a need for new algorithms able to deal with large-scale datasets and techniques to adapt traditional machine learning algorithms to this new paradigm. This paper presents several ensemble alternatives, based on model selection and combination, that allow for obtaining a continuous piecewise linear regression model from large-scale datasets using the learning algorithm of the LHM. Our empirical tests have proved that model combination outperforms model selection and that these methods can provide better results in terms of bias, variance, and execution time than the original algorithm executed over the entire dataset.">

        <tr id="We have developed an advanced workflow for reservoir characterization, effectively addressing the challenges of reservoir history matching through a novel approach. This method integrates a Physics Informed Neural Operator (PINO) as a forward model within a sophisticated Cluster Classify Regress (CCR) framework. The process is enhanced by an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman Inversion (aREKI), optimized for rapid uncertainty quantification in reservoir history matching. This innovative workflow parameterizes unknown permeability and porosity fields, capturing non-Gaussian posterior measures with techniques such as a variational convolution autoencoder and the CCR. Serving as exotic priors and a supervised model, the CCR synergizes with the PINO surrogate to accurately simulate the nonlinear dynamics of Peaceman well equations. The CCR approach allows for flexibility in applying distinct machine learning algorithms across its stages. Updates to the PINO reservoir surrogate are driven by a loss function derived from supervised data, initial conditions, and residuals of governing black oil PDEs. Our integrated model, termed PINO-Res-Sim, outputs crucial parameters including pressures, saturations, and production rates for oil, water, and gas. Validated against traditional simulators through controlled experiments on synthetic reservoirs and the Norne field, the methodology showed remarkable accuracy. Additionally, the PINO-Res-Sim in the aREKI workflow efficiently recovered unknown fields with a computational speedup of 100 to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. The learning phase for PINO-Res-Sim, conducted on an NVIDIA H100, was impressively efficient, compatible with ensemble-based methods for complex computational tasks.">

This paper proposes a novel Bayesian filtering algorithm that considers algorithmic computational cost and estimation accuracy for high-dimensional linear systems. The high-dimensional state vector is divided into several blocks to save computation resources by avoiding the calculation of error covariance with immense dimensions. After that, two sequential states are estimated simultaneously by introducing an auxiliary variable in the new probability space, mitigating the performance degradation caused by state segmentation. Moreover, the computational cost and error covariance of the proposed algorithm are analyzed analytically to show its distinct features compared with several existing methods. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed Bayesian filtering can maintain a higher estimation accuracy with reasonable computational cost when applied to high-dimensional linear systems.">

        <tr id="Of all the vector fields surrounding the minima of recurrent learning setups, the gradient field with its exploding and vanishing updates appears a poor choice for optimization, offering little beyond efficient computability. We seek to improve this suboptimal practice in the context of physics simulations, where backpropagating feedback through many unrolled time steps is considered crucial to acquiring temporally coherent behavior. The alternative vector field we propose follows from two principles: physics simulators, unlike neural networks, have a balanced gradient flow, and certain modifications to the backpropagation pass leave the positions of the original minima unchanged. As any modification of backpropagation decouples forward and backward pass, the rotation-free character of the gradient field is lost. Therefore, we discuss the negative implications of using such a rotational vector field for optimization and how to counteract them. Our final procedure is easily implementable via a sequence of gradient stopping and component-wise comparison operations, which do not negatively affect scalability. Our experiments on three control problems show that especially as we increase the complexity of each task, the unbalanced updates from the gradient can no longer provide the precise control signals necessary while our method still solves the tasks.

        <tr id="Local-nonlocal coupling approaches combine the computational efficiency of local models and the accuracy of nonlocal models. However, the coupling process is challenging, requiring expertise to identify the interface between local and nonlocal regions. This study introduces a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect the regions in which the local and nonlocal models should be used in a coupling approach. This identification process uses the loading functions and provides as output the selected model at the grid points. Training is based on datasets of loading functions for which reference coupling configurations are computed using accurate coupled solutions, where accuracy is measured in terms of the relative error between the solution to the coupling approach and the solution to the nonlocal model. We study two approaches that differ from one another in terms of the data structure. The first approach, referred to as the full-domain input data approach, inputs the full load vector and outputs a full label vector. In this case, the classification process is carried out globally. The second approach consists of a window-based approach, where loads are preprocessed and partitioned into windows and the problem is formulated as a node-wise classification approach in which the central point of each window is treated individually. The classification problems are solved via deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks. The performance of these approaches is studied on one-dimensional numerical examples using F1-scores and accuracy metrics. In particular, it is shown that the windowing approach provides promising results, achieving an accuracy of 0.96 and an F1-score of 0.97. These results underscore the potential of the approach to automate coupling processes, leading to more accurate and computationally efficient solutions for material science applications.">

Asymptotic convergence of weight learning, vital for good output prediction, was seldom guaranteed for online applications. Since linear regression is the most fundamental component in machine learning, we focus on this model in this paper. Aiming at online applications, a deterministic analysis method is developed based on LaSalle's invariance principle. Convergence conditions are derived for both the first-order and the second-order learning algorithms, without resorting to any stochastic argument. Moreover, the deterministic approach makes it easy to analyze the noise influence. Specifically, adaptive hyperparameters are derived in this framework and their tuning rules disclosed for the compensation of measurement noise. Comparison with four most popular algorithms validates that this approach has a higher learning capability and is quite promising in enhancing the weight learning performance.">

Contrarily, we propose a simple yet effective machine learning model that learns the horizontal movement in the dynamical core and vertical movement in the physical parameterization separately. By replacing the advection with a graph attention network and the convection with a multi-layer perceptron, our model provides a new and efficient perspective to simulate the transition of variables in atmospheric models. We also assess the model's performance over a 5-day iterative forecasting. Under the same input variables and training methods, our model outperforms existing data-driven methods with a significantly-reduced number of parameters with a resolution of 5.625 deg.

We demonstrate that under noiseless conditions, the replication dynamics can be uniquely identified by the proposed model. Computing a global solution to this optimization problem is specially challenging because of its multiple local minima. We present the DNA-inverse optimization method that is capable of finding this global solution even in the presence of noise. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art optimization methods highlights the superior computational efficiency of our approach. DNA-inverse enables the automatic recovery of all configurations of the replication dynamics, which was not possible with previous methods.">

        <tr id="We introduce a conditional pseudo-reversible normalizing flow for constructing surrogate models of a physical model polluted by additive noise to efficiently quantify forward and inverse uncertainty propagation. Existing surrogate modeling approaches usually focus on approximating the deterministic component of physical model. However, this strategy necessitates knowledge of noise and resorts to auxiliary sampling methods for quantifying inverse uncertainty propagation. In this work, we develop the conditional pseudo-reversible normalizing flow model to directly learn and efficiently generate samples from the conditional probability density functions. The training process utilizes dataset consisting of input-output pairs without requiring prior knowledge about the noise and the function. Our model, once trained, can generate samples from any conditional probability density functions whose high probability regions are covered by the training set. Moreover, the pseudo-reversibility feature allows for the use of fully-connected neural network architectures, which simplifies the implementation and enables theoretical analysis. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the conditional pseudo-reversible normalizing flow model, showing its ability to converge to the target conditional probability density function using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to several benchmark tests and a real-world geologic carbon storage problem.">

        <tr id="This study presents a novel approach to quantifying uncertainties in Bayesian model updating, which is effective in sparse or single observations. Conventional uncertainty quantification metrics such as the Euclidean and Bhattacharyya distance-based metrics are potential in scenarios with ample observations. However, their validation is limited in situations with insufficient data, particularly for nonlinear responses like post-yield behavior. Our method addresses this challenge by using the latent space of a Variational Auto-encoder (VAE), a generative model that enables nonparametric likelihood evaluation. This approach is valuable in updating model parameters based on nonlinear seismic responses of structure, wherein data scarcity is a common challenge. Our numerical experiments confirm the ability of the proposed method to accurately update parameters and quantify uncertainties using limited observations. Additionally, these numerical experiments reveal a tendency for increased information about nonlinear behavior to result in decreased uncertainty in terms of estimations. This study provides a robust tool for quantifying uncertainty in scenarios characterized by considerable uncertainty, thereby expanding the applicability of Bayesian updating methods in data-constrained environments.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to time series forecasting, leveraging their adaptive activation functions for enhanced predictive modeling. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs replace traditional linear weights with spline-parametrized univariate functions, allowing them to learn activation patterns dynamically. We demonstrate that KANs outperforms conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in a real-world satellite traffic forecasting task, providing more accurate results with considerably fewer number of learnable parameters. We also provide an ablation study of KAN-specific parameters impact on performance. The proposed approach opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, emphasizing the potential of KANs as a powerful tool in predictive analytics.">

        <tr id="An issue for molecular dynamics simulations is that events of interest often involve timescales that are much longer than the simulation time step, which is set by the fastest timescales of the model. Because of this timescale separation, direct simulation of many events is prohibitively computationally costly. This issue can be overcome by aggregating information from many relatively short simulations that sample segments of trajectories involving events of interest. This is the strategy of Markov state models (MSMs) and related approaches, but such methods suffer from approximation error because the variables defining the states generally do not capture the dynamics fully. By contrast, once converged, the weighted ensemble (WE) method aggregates information from trajectory segments so as to yield unbiased estimates of both thermodynamic and kinetic statistics. Unfortunately, errors decay no faster than unbiased simulation in WE. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for describing WE that shows that introduction of an element of stratification, as in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS), accelerates convergence. Then, building on ideas from MSMs and related methods, we propose an improved stratification that allows approximation error to be reduced systematically. We show that the improved stratification can decrease simulation times required to achieve a desired precision by orders of magnitude.">
