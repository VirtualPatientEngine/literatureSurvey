        <tr id="Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.">

        <tr id="In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different time points. Here, we introduce RAINDROP, a graph neural network that embeds irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. RAINDROP represents every sample as a separate sensor graph and models time-varying dependencies between sensors with a novel message passing operator. It estimates the latent sensor graph structure and leverages the structure together with nearby observations to predict misaligned readouts. This model can be interpreted as a graph neural network that sends messages over graphs that are optimized for capturing time-varying dependencies among sensors. We use RAINDROP to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. RAINDROP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.4% (absolute F1-score points), including techniques that deal with irregular sampling using fixed discretization and set functions. RAINDROP shows superiority in diverse setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have shown to be effective in time series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global) inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate predictions.">

        <tr id="Outstanding achievements of graph neural networks for spatiotemporal time series analysis show that relational constraints introduce an effective inductive bias into neural forecasting architectures. Often, however, the relational information characterizing the underlying data-generating process is unavailable and the practitioner is left with the problem of inferring from data which relational graph to use in the subsequent processing stages. We propose novel, principled - yet practical - probabilistic score-based methods that learn the relational dependencies as distributions over graphs while maximizing end-to-end the performance at task. The proposed graph learning framework is based on consolidated variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo score-based gradient estimation, is theoretically grounded, and, as we show, effective in practice. In this paper, we focus on the time series forecasting problem and show that, by tailoring the gradient estimators to the graph learning problem, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance while controlling the sparsity of the learned graph and the computational scalability. We empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that the proposed solution can be used as a stand-alone graph identification procedure as well as a graph learning component of an end-to-end forecasting architecture.">

        <tr id="Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic) graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed, recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions.">

        <tr id="By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.">

        <tr id="Attention mechanisms have been widely used to capture long-range dependencies among nodes in Graph Transformers. Bottlenecked by the quadratic computational cost, attention mechanisms fail to scale in large graphs. Recent improvements in computational efficiency are mainly achieved by attention sparsification with random or heuristic-based graph subsampling, which falls short in data-dependent context reasoning. State space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained prominence for their effectiveness and efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, adapting SSMs to non-sequential graph data presents a notable challenge. In this work, we introduce Graph-Mamba, the first attempt to enhance long-range context modeling in graph networks by integrating a Mamba block with the input-dependent node selection mechanism. Specifically, we formulate graph-centric node prioritization and permutation strategies to enhance context-aware reasoning, leading to a substantial improvement in predictive performance. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-range graph prediction tasks, with a fraction of the computational cost in both FLOPs and GPU memory consumption.

        <tr id="Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.">

        <tr id="Large pre-trained models excel in zero/few-shot learning for language and vision tasks but face challenges in multivariate time series (TS) forecasting due to diverse data characteristics. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1.

        <tr id="Pre-training on time series poses a unique challenge due to the potential mismatch between pre-training and target domains, such as shifts in temporal dynamics, fast-evolving trends, and long-range and short-cyclic effects, which can lead to poor downstream performance. While domain adaptation methods can mitigate these shifts, most methods need examples directly from the target domain, making them suboptimal for pre-training. To address this challenge, methods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and be capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training. Relative to other modalities, in time series, we expect that time-based and frequency-based representations of the same example are located close together in the time-frequency space. To this end, we posit that time-frequency consistency (TF-C) -- embedding a time-based neighborhood of an example close to its frequency-based neighborhood -- is desirable for pre-training. Motivated by TF-C, we define a decomposable pre-training model, where the self-supervised signal is provided by the distance between time and frequency components, each individually trained by contrastive estimation. We evaluate the new method on eight datasets, including electrodiagnostic testing, human activity recognition, mechanical fault detection, and physical status monitoring. Experiments against eight state-of-the-art methods show that TF-C outperforms baselines by 15.4% (F1 score) on average in one-to-one settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model on EMG data) and by 8.4% (precision) in challenging one-to-many settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model for either hand-gesture recognition or mechanical fault prediction), reflecting the breadth of scenarios that arise in real-world applications.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that Raincoat can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.">

The proposed AZ-test can be intended as a spatio-temporal extension of traditional tests designed for system identiﬁcation to graph signals. The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes over time, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as it is the case in many application scenarios like sensor and transportation networks. The asymptotic distribution of the designed test can be derived under the null hypothesis without assuming identically distributed data. We show the effectiveness of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and illustrate how it can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graph stream.">

The manuscript aims, for the first time, at filling this gap by matching state-space modeling and spatio-temporal data where the relational information, say the functional graph capturing latent dependencies, is learned directly from data and is allowed to change over time. Within a probabilistic formulation that accounts for the uncertainty in the data-generating process, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn the state-space model end-to-end on a downstream task.

        <tr id="The challenge of effectively learning inter-series correlations for multivariate time series forecasting remains a substantial and unresolved problem. Traditional deep learning models, which are largely dependent on the Transformer paradigm for modeling long sequences, often fail to integrate information from multiple time series into a coherent and universally applicable model. To bridge this gap, our paper presents ForecastGrapher, a framework reconceptualizes multivariate time series forecasting as a node regression task, providing a unique avenue for capturing the intricate temporal dynamics and inter-series correlations. Our approach is underpinned by three pivotal steps: firstly, generating custom node embeddings to reflect the temporal variations within each series; secondly, constructing an adaptive adjacency matrix to encode the inter-series correlations; and thirdly, augmenting the GNNs' expressive power by diversifying the node feature distribution. To enhance this expressive power, we introduce the Group Feature Convolution GNN (GFC-GNN). This model employs a learnable scaler to segment node features into multiple groups and applies one-dimensional convolutions with different kernel lengths to each group prior to the aggregation phase. Consequently, the GFC-GNN method enriches the diversity of node feature distribution in a fully end-to-end fashion. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that ForecastGrapher surpasses strong baselines and leading published techniques in the domain of multivariate time series forecasting.">

        <tr id="Time series data are ubiquitous across various domains, making time series analysis critically important. Traditional time series models are task-specific, featuring singular functionality and limited generalization capacity. Recently, large language foundation models have unveiled their remarkable capabilities for cross-task transferability, zero-shot/few-shot learning, and decision-making explainability. This success has sparked interest in the exploration of foundation models to solve multiple time series challenges simultaneously. There are two main research lines, namely pre-training foundation models from scratch for time series and adapting large language foundation models for time series. They both contribute to the development of a unified model that is highly generalizable, versatile, and comprehensible for time series analysis. This survey offers a 3E analytical framework for comprehensive examination of related research. Specifically, we examine existing works from three dimensions, namely Effectiveness, Efficiency and Explainability. In each dimension, we focus on discussing how related works devise tailored solution by considering unique challenges in the realm of time series. Furthermore, we provide a domain taxonomy to help followers keep up with the domain-specific advancements. In addition, we introduce extensive resources to facilitate the field's development, including datasets, open-source, time series libraries.

        <tr id="The widespread adoption of scalable mobile sensing has led to large amounts of time series data for real-world applications. A fundamental application is multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which aims to predict future time series values based on historical observations. Existing MTSF methods suffer from limited parameterization and small-scale training data. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced in time series, which achieve promising forecasting performance but incur heavy computational costs. To solve these challenges, we propose TimeCMA, an LLM-empowered framework for time series forecasting with cross-modality alignment. We design a dual-modality encoding module with two branches, where the time series encoding branch extracts relatively low-quality yet pure embeddings of time series through an inverted Transformer. In addition, the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series as prompts to obtain high-quality yet entangled prompt embeddings via a Pre-trained LLM. Then, we design a cross-modality alignment module to retrieve high-quality and pure time series embeddings from the prompt embeddings. Moreover, we develop a time series forecasting module to decode the aligned embeddings while capturing dependencies among multiple variables for forecasting. Notably, we tailor the prompt to encode sufficient temporal information into a last token and design the last token embedding storage to reduce computational costs. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.">

        <tr id="Time series imputation plays a crucial role in various real-world systems and has been extensively explored. Models for time series imputation often require specialization, necessitating distinct designs for different domains and missing patterns. In this study, we introduce NuwaTS, a framework to repurpose Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for general time series imputation. Once trained, this model can be applied to imputation tasks on incomplete time series from any domain with any missing patterns. We begin by devising specific embeddings for each sub-series patch of the incomplete time series. These embeddings encapsulate information about the patch itself, the missing data patterns within the patch, and the patch's statistical characteristics. To enhance the model's adaptability to different missing patterns, we propose a contrastive learning approach to make representations of the same patch more similar across different missing patterns. By combining this contrastive loss with the missing data imputation task, we train PLMs to obtain a one-for-all imputation model. Furthermore, we utilize a plug-and-play layer-wise fine-tuning approach to train domain-specific models. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging a dataset of over seventeen million time series from diverse domains, we obtain a one-for-all imputation model which outperforms existing domain-specific models across various datasets and missing patterns. Additionally, we find that NuwaTS can be generalized to other time series tasks such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.">

        <tr id="Unlike natural language processing and computer vision, the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for time series forecasting is blocked due to data scarcity. While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained significant traction in the forecasting domain, especially for their capacity to simultaneously account for intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series relationships. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical GNN (DeepHGNN) framework, explicitly designed for forecasting in complex hierarchical structures. The uniqueness of DeepHGNN lies in its innovative graph-based hierarchical interpolation and an end-to-end reconciliation mechanism. This approach ensures forecast accuracy and coherence across various hierarchical levels while sharing signals across them, addressing a key challenge in hierarchical forecasting. A critical insight in hierarchical time series is the variance in forecastability across levels, with upper levels typically presenting more predictable components. DeepHGNN capitalizes on this insight by pooling and leveraging knowledge from all hierarchy levels, thereby enhancing the overall forecast accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation set against several state-of-the-art models confirm the superior performance of DeepHGNN. This research not only demonstrates DeepHGNN's effectiveness in achieving significantly improved forecast accuracy but also contributes to the understanding of graph-based methods in hierarchical time series forecasting.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based models have emerged as powerful tools for multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, existing Transformer models often fall short of capturing both intricate dependencies across variate and temporal dimensions in MTS data. Some recent models are proposed to separately capture variate and temporal dependencies through either two sequential or parallel attention mechanisms. However, these methods cannot directly and explicitly learn the intricate inter-series and intra-series dependencies. In this work, we first demonstrate that these dependencies are very important as they usually exist in real-world data. To directly model these dependencies, we propose a transformer-based model UniTST containing a unified attention mechanism on the flattened patch tokens. Additionally, we add a dispatcher module which reduces the complexity and makes the model feasible for a potentially large number of variates. Although our proposed model employs a simple architecture, it offers compelling performance as shown in our extensive experiments on several datasets for time series forecasting.">

Recent findings have indicated that simpler linear models might outperform complex Transformer-based approaches, highlighting the potential for more streamlined architectures.

To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional Transformer framework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention mechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as queries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term forecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory usage.

        <tr id="With the increasing collection of time series data from various domains, there arises a strong demand for general time series forecasting models pre-trained on a large number of time-series datasets to support a variety of downstream prediction tasks. Enabling general time series forecasting faces two challenges: how to obtain unified representations from multi-domian time series data, and how to capture domain-specific features from time series data across various domains for adaptive transfer in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a Register Assisted General Time Series Forecasting Model with Decomposed Frequency Learning (ROSE), a novel pre-trained model for time series forecasting. ROSE employs Decomposed Frequency Learning for the pre-training task, which decomposes coupled semantic and periodic information in time series with frequency-based masking and reconstruction to obtain unified representations across domains. We also equip ROSE with a Time Series Register, which learns to generate a register codebook to capture domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances domain-adaptive transfer by selecting related register tokens on downstream tasks. After pre-training on large-scale time series data, ROSE achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 8 real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, even in few-shot scenarios, it demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods trained with full data.">

A recent model, Mamba, based on selective state space models (SSMs), has emerged as a competitive alternative to Transformer, offering comparable performance with higher throughput and linear complexity related to sequence length. In this study, we analyze the limitations of current Mamba in LTSF and propose four targeted improvements, leading to MambaTS. We first introduce variable scan along time to arrange the historical information of all the variables together. We suggest that causal convolution in Mamba is not necessary for LTSF and propose the Temporal Mamba Block (TMB). We further incorporate a dropout mechanism for selective parameters of TMB to mitigate model overfitting. Moreover, we tackle the issue of variable scan order sensitivity by introducing variable permutation training. We further propose variable-aware scan along time to dynamically discover variable relationships during training and decode the optimal variable scan order by solving the shortest path visiting all nodes problem during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on eight public datasets demonstrate that MambaTS achieves new state-of-the-art performance.">

Multivariate models like multivariate attention and graph neural networks can explicitly incorporate inter-series information, thus addressing the shortcomings of global models. However, these techniques exhibit quadratic complexity per timestep, limiting scalability. This paper introduces the Context Neural Network, an efficient linear complexity approach for augmenting time series models with relevant contextual insights from neighbouring time series without significant computational overhead.

Recent progress on state space models (SSMs) have shown impressive performance on modeling long range dependency due to their subquadratic complexity.

Particularly, the emergence of pre-trained LLMs-based temporal works, compared to previous deep model approaches, has demonstrated superior generalization and robustness, showcasing the potential of generative pre-trained paradigms as foundation models for time series. However, those LLMs-based works mainly focus on cross-modal research, i.e., leveraging the language capabilities of LLMs in time series contexts. Although they have achieved impressive performance, there still exist the issues of concept drift caused by differences in data distribution and inflexibility caused by misalignment of dimensions. To this end, inspired by recent work on LVMs, we reconsider the paradigm of time series modeling. In this paper, we comprehensively explore, for the first time, the effectiveness and superiority of the Generative Pre-trained Diffusion (GPD) paradigm in real-world multivariate time series forecasting (TSF). Specifically, to mitigate performance bias introduced by sophisticated networks, we propose a straightforward MLP diffusion network for unconditional modeling of time series. Then we employ a zero-shot and tuning-free method to predict (generate) future data using historical data as prompts. The GPD paradigm is established on the time series modality, effectively preventing the phenomenon of concept drift, and enabling flexible forecasting of arbitrary lengths. We demonstrate that the GPD paradigm achieves comprehensive performance and generalization comparable to current SOTA LLM-based and deep model paradigms on mainstream benchmarks and various TSF tasks. Extensive experiments validate the potential of the GPD paradigm and its assistance in future related research.">

        <tr id="Time series prediction is crucial for understanding and forecasting complex dynamics in various domains, ranging from finance and economics to climate and healthcare. Based on Transformer architecture, one approach involves encoding multiple variables from the same timestamp into a single temporal token to model global dependencies. In contrast, another approach embeds the time points of individual series into separate variate tokens. The former method faces challenges in learning variate-centric representations, while the latter risks missing essential temporal information critical for accurate forecasting. In our work, we introduce GridTST, a model that combines the benefits of two approaches using innovative multi-directional attentions based on a vanilla Transformer. We regard the input time series data as a grid, where the $x$-axis represents the time steps and the $y$-axis represents the variates. A vertical slicing of this grid combines the variates at each time step into a \textit{time token}, while a horizontal slicing embeds the individual series across all time steps into a \textit{variate token}. Correspondingly, a \textit{horizontal attention mechanism} focuses on time tokens to comprehend the correlations between data at various time steps, while a \textit{vertical}, variate-aware \textit{attention} is employed to grasp multivariate correlations. This combination enables efficient processing of information across both time and variate dimensions, thereby enhancing the model's analytical strength. % We also integrate the patch technique, segmenting time tokens into subseries-level patches, ensuring that local semantic information is retained in the embedding. The GridTST model consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across various real-world datasets.">

        <tr id="Time series analysis remains a major challenge due to its sparse characteristics, high dimensionality, and inconsistent data quality. Recent advancements in transformer-based techniques have enhanced capabilities in forecasting and imputation; however, these methods are still resource-heavy, lack adaptability, and face difficulties in integrating both local and global attributes of time series. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new architectural concept for time series analysis based on introspection. Central to this concept is the self-supervised pretraining of Time Series Representation Models (TSRMs), which once learned can be easily tailored and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, in an automated and resource-efficient manner. Our architecture is equipped with a flexible and hierarchical representation learning process, which is robust against missing data and outliers. It can capture and learn both local and global features of the structure, semantics, and crucial patterns of a given time series category, such as heart rate data. Our learned time series representation models can be efficiently adapted to a specific task, such as forecasting or imputation, without manual intervention. Furthermore, our architecture's design supports explainability by highlighting the significance of each input value for the task at hand. Our empirical study using four benchmark datasets shows that, compared to investigated state-of-the-art baseline methods, our architecture improves imputation and forecasting errors by up to 90.34% and 71.54%, respectively, while reducing the required trainable parameters by up to 92.43%.

        <tr id="In recent years, significant progress has been made in multivariate time series forecasting using Linear-based, Transformer-based, and Convolution-based models. However, these approaches face notable limitations: linear forecasters struggle with representation capacities, attention mechanisms suffer from quadratic complexity, and convolutional models have a restricted receptive field. These constraints impede their effectiveness in modeling complex time series, particularly those with numerous variables. Additionally, many models adopt the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy, treating multivariate time series as uncorrelated univariate series while ignoring their correlations. For models considering inter-channel relationships, whether through the self-attention mechanism, linear combination, or convolution, they all incur high computational costs and focus solely on weighted summation relationships, neglecting potential proportional relationships between channels. In this work, we address these issues by leveraging the newly introduced state space model and propose \textbf{C-Mamba}, a novel approach that captures cross-channel dependencies while maintaining linear complexity without losing the global receptive field. Our model consists of two key components: (i) channel mixup, where two channels are mixed to enhance the training sets; (ii) channel attention enhanced patch-wise Mamba encoder that leverages the ability of the state space models to capture cross-time dependencies and models correlations between channels by mining their weight relationships. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven real-world time series datasets. Moreover, the proposed mixup and attention strategy exhibits strong generalizability across other frameworks.">

        <tr id="Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.">

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs.

Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon.">

Traditional Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in TSRL fall into four main categories: reconstructive, adversarial, contrastive, and predictive, each with a common challenge of sensitivity to noise and intricate data nuances. Recently, diffusion-based methods have shown advanced generative capabilities. However, they primarily target specific application scenarios like imputation and forecasting, leaving a gap in leveraging diffusion models for generic TSRL. Our work, Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE), bridges this gap as the first diffusion-based SSL TSRL approach. TSDE segments TS data into observed and masked parts using an Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask. It applies a trainable embedding function, featuring dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders with a crossover mechanism, to the observed part. We train a reverse diffusion process conditioned on the embeddings, designed to predict noise added to the masked part. Extensive experiments demonstrate TSDE's superiority in imputation, interpolation, forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and clustering. We also conduct an ablation study, present embedding visualizations, and compare inference speed, further substantiating TSDE's efficiency and validity in learning representations of TS data.">

        <tr id="Deep learning methods have been exerting their strengths in long-term time series forecasting. However, they often struggle to strike a balance between expressive power and computational efficiency. Resorting to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) provides a compromising solution, yet they suffer from two critical problems caused by the intrinsic point-wise mapping mode, in terms of deficient contextual dependencies and inadequate information bottleneck. Here, we propose the Coarsened Perceptron Network (CP-Net), featured by a coarsening strategy that alleviates the above problems associated with the prototype MLPs by forming information granules in place of solitary temporal points. The CP-Net utilizes primarily a two-stage framework for extracting semantic and contextual patterns, which preserves correlations over larger timespans and filters out volatile noises. This is further enhanced by a multi-scale setting, where patterns of diverse granularities are fused towards a comprehensive prediction. Based purely on convolutions of structural simplicity, CP-Net is able to maintain a linear computational complexity and low runtime, while demonstrates an improvement of 4.1% compared with the SOTA method on seven forecasting benchmarks.">

        <tr id="In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, existing state-of-the-art deep learning approaches tend to focus on autoregressive formulations and overlook the information within exogenous indicators. To address this limitation, we present DeformTime, a neural network architecture that attempts to capture correlated temporal patterns from the input space, and hence, improve forecasting accuracy. It deploys two core operations performed by deformable attention blocks (DABs): learning dependencies across variables from different time steps (variable DAB), and preserving temporal dependencies in data from previous time steps (temporal DAB). Input data transformation is explicitly designed to enhance learning from the deformed series of information while passing through a DAB. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 MTS data sets, using previously established benchmarks as well as challenging infectious disease modelling tasks with more exogenous variables. The results demonstrate that DeformTime improves accuracy against previous competitive methods across the vast majority of MTS forecasting tasks, reducing the mean absolute error by 10% on average. Notably, performance gains remain consistent across longer forecasting horizons.">

Prior research has established that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) deliver impressive outcomes in graph-centric tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite these advancements, challenges like data sparsity and limited generalization capabilities continue to persist. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention in natural language processing. They excel in language comprehension and summarization. Integrating LLMs with graph learning techniques has attracted interest as a way to enhance performance in graph learning tasks. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth review of the latest state-of-the-art LLMs applied in graph learning and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize existing methods based on their framework design. We detail four unique designs: i) GNNs as Prefix, ii) LLMs as Prefix, iii) LLMs-Graphs Integration, and iv) LLMs-Only, highlighting key methodologies within each category. We explore the strengths and limitations of each framework, and emphasize potential avenues for future research, including overcoming current integration challenges between LLMs and graph learning techniques, and venturing into new application areas.

        <tr id="Multivariate time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as finance, traffic management, energy, and healthcare. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of channel independence to resist distribution drift but neglect channel correlations, limiting further enhancements. Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Redistribute (STAR) module. Unlike traditional approaches that manage channel interactions through distributed structures, \textit{e.g.}, attention, STAR employs a centralized strategy to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on the quality of each channel. It aggregates all series to form a global core representation, which is then dispatched and fused with individual series representations to facilitate channel interactions effectively.SOFTS achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods with only linear complexity. The broad applicability of the STAR module across different forecasting models is also demonstrated empirically. For further research and development, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/Secilia-Cxy/SOFTS.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting is widely used in extensive applications, such as traffic planning and weather forecasting. However, real-world time series usually present intricate temporal variations, making forecasting extremely challenging. Going beyond the mainstream paradigms of plain decomposition and multiperiodicity analysis, we analyze temporal variations in a novel view of multiscale-mixing, which is based on an intuitive but important observation that time series present distinct patterns in different sampling scales. The microscopic and the macroscopic information are reflected in fine and coarse scales respectively, and thereby complex variations can be inherently disentangled. Based on this observation, we propose TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM) blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases. Concretely, PDM applies the decomposition to multiscale series and further mixes the decomposed seasonal and trend components in fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions separately, which successively aggregates the microscopic seasonal and macroscopic trend information. FMM further ensembles multiple predictors to utilize complementary forecasting capabilities in multiscale observations. Consequently, TimeMixer is able to achieve consistent state-of-the-art performances in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency.">

        <tr id="Recently, multivariate time series forecasting tasks have garnered increasing attention due to their significant practical applications, leading to the emergence of various deep forecasting models. However, real-world time series exhibit pronounced non-stationary distribution characteristics. These characteristics are not solely limited to time-varying statistical properties highlighted by non-stationary Transformer but also encompass three key aspects: nested periodicity, absence of periodic distributions, and hysteresis among time variables. In this paper, we begin by validating this theory through wavelet analysis and propose the Transformer-based TwinS model, which consists of three modules to address the non-stationary periodic distributions: Wavelet Convolution, Period-Aware Attention, and Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP. Specifically, The Wavelet Convolution models nested periods by scaling the convolution kernel size like wavelet transform. The Period-Aware Attention guides attention computation by generating period relevance scores through a convolutional sub-network. The Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP captures the overall relationships between time series through channel-time mixing learning. TwinS achieves SOTA performance compared to mainstream TS models, with a maximum improvement in MSE of 25.8\% over PatchTST.">

Unfortunately, the majority of current time series prediction models fail to simultaneously learn the correlations of multivariate time series at multi-grained levels, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Multi-Grained Correlations-based Prediction (MGCP) Network, which simultaneously considers the correlations at three granularity levels to enhance prediction performance. Specifically, MGCP utilizes Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators and Graph Convolutional Networks to learn the global spatiotemporal correlations and inter-series correlations, enabling the extraction of potential features from multivariate time series at fine-grained and medium-grained levels. Additionally, MGCP employs adversarial training with an attention mechanism-based predictor and conditional discriminator to optimize prediction results at coarse-grained level, ensuring high fidelity between the generated forecast results and the actual data distribution. Finally, we compare MGCP with several state-of-the-art time series prediction algorithms on real-world benchmark datasets, and our results demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the proposed model.">

In this work, we go beyond computer vision and perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both time series transformers and state-space models. To effectively scale token merging to long sequences, we introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, adjusting the computational complexity from linear to quadratic based on the neighborhood size. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that token merging offers substantial computational benefits with minimal impact on accuracy across various models and datasets. On the recently proposed Chronos foundation model, we achieve accelerations up to 5400% with only minor accuracy degradations.">

However, despite their considerable advantages over traditional statistical approaches, current deep learning-based predictive models often exhibit a significant deviation between their forecasting outcomes and the ground truth. This discrepancy is largely due to an insufficient emphasis on extracting the sequence's latent information, particularly its global information within the frequency domain and the relationship between different variables. To address this issue, we propose a novel model Frequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons, which decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components using a multi-scale sequence adaptive decomposition and fusion architecture, and processes them separately. FAITH utilizes Frequency Channel feature Extraction Module and Frequency Temporal feature Extraction Module to capture inter-channel relationships and temporal global information in the sequence, significantly improving its ability to handle long-term dependencies and complex patterns. Furthermore, FAITH achieves theoretically linear complexity by modifying the time-frequency domain transformation method, effectively reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks for long-term forecasting and 3 benchmarks for short-term forecasting demonstrate that FAITH outperforms existing models in many fields, such as electricity, weather and traffic, proving its effectiveness and superiority both in long-term and short-term time series forecasting tasks.

        <tr id="Time series clustering is fundamental in data analysis for discovering temporal patterns. Despite recent advancements, learning cluster-friendly representations is still challenging, particularly with long and complex time series. Deep temporal clustering methods have been trying to integrate the canonical k-means into end-to-end training of neural networks but fall back on surrogate losses due to the non-differentiability of the hard cluster assignment, yielding sub-optimal solutions. In addition, the autoregressive strategy used in the state-of-the-art RNNs is subject to error accumulation and slow training, while recent research findings have revealed that Transformers are less effective due to time points lacking semantic meaning, to the permutation invariance of attention that discards the chronological order and high computation cost. In light of these observations, we present LoSTer which is a novel dense autoencoder architecture for the long-sequence time series clustering problem (LSTC) capable of optimizing the k-means objective via the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization trick and designed specifically for accurate and fast clustering of long time series. Extensive experiments on numerous benchmark datasets and two real-world applications prove the effectiveness of LoSTer over state-of-the-art RNNs and Transformer-based deep clustering methods.">

        <tr id="Machine learning on graphs has recently found extensive applications across domains. However, the commonly used Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) suffer from limited expressive power and struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Graph transformers offer a strong alternative due to their global attention mechanism, but they come with great computational overheads, especially for large graphs. In recent years, State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a compelling approach to replace full attention in transformers to model sequential data. It blends the strengths of RNNs and CNNs, offering a) efficient computation, b) the ability to capture long-range dependencies, and c) good generalization across sequences of various lengths. However, extending SSMs to graph-structured data presents unique challenges due to the lack of canonical node ordering in graphs. In this work, we propose Graph State Space Convolution (GSSC) as a principled extension of SSMs to graph-structured data. By leveraging global permutation-equivariant set aggregation and factorizable graph kernels that rely on relative node distances as the convolution kernels, GSSC preserves all three advantages of SSMs. We demonstrate the provably stronger expressiveness of GSSC than MPNNs in counting graph substructures and show its effectiveness across 10 real-world, widely used benchmark datasets, where GSSC achieves best results on 7 out of 10 datasets with all significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art baselines and second-best results on the other 3 datasets. Our findings highlight the potential of GSSC as a powerful and scalable model for graph machine learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/GSSC.">

Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have gradually become the theme of MTSF model as their powerful capability in mining spatial-temporal dependencies, but almost of them heavily rely on the assumption of historical data integrity. In reality, due to factors such as data collector failures and time-consuming repairment, it is extremely challenging to collect the whole historical observations without missing any variable. In this case, STGNNs can only utilize a subset of normal variables and easily suffer from the incorrect spatial-temporal dependency modeling issue, resulting in the degradation of their forecasting performance. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Interpolation Attention Recursive Network (named GinAR) to precisely model the spatial-temporal dependencies over the limited collected data for forecasting. In GinAR, it consists of two key components, that is, interpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution to take place of the fully connected layer of simple recursive units, and thus are capable of recovering all missing variables and reconstructing the correct spatial-temporal dependencies for recursively modeling of multivariate time series data, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GinAR outperforms 11 SOTA baselines, and even when 90% of variables are missing, it can still accurately predict the future values of all variables.">

        <tr id="Traffic flow prediction, a critical aspect of intelligent transportation systems, has been increasingly popular in the field of artificial intelligence, driven by the availability of extensive traffic data. The current challenges of traffic flow prediction lie in integrating diverse factors while balancing the trade-off between computational complexity and the precision necessary for effective long-range and large-scale predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-Mamba) model, which is the first to leverage the power of spatial-temporal learning in traffic flow prediction without using graph modeling. The ST-Mamba model can effectively capture the long-range dependency for traffic flow data, thereby avoiding the issue of over-smoothing. The proposed ST-Mamba model incorporates an effective Spatial-Temporal Mixer (ST-Mixer) to seamlessly integrate spatial and temporal data processing into a unified framework and employs a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-SSM) block to improve computational efficiency. The proposed ST-Mamba model, specifically designed for spatial-temporal data, simplifies processing procedure and enhances generalization capabilities, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of long-range traffic flow prediction. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the proposed ST-Mamba model achieves a 61.11\% improvement in computational speed and increases prediction accuracy by 0.67\%. Extensive experiments with real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the \textsf{ST-Mamba} model sets a new benchmark in traffic flow prediction, achieving SOTA performance in computational efficiency for both long- and short-range predictions and significantly improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of traffic management.">

        <tr id="In multivariate time series forecasting, the Transformer architecture encounters two significant challenges: effectively mining features from historical sequences and avoiding overfitting during the learning of temporal dependencies. To tackle these challenges, this paper deconstructs time series forecasting into the learning of historical sequences and prediction sequences, introducing the Cross-Variable and Time Network (CVTN). This unique method divides multivariate time series forecasting into two phases: cross-variable learning for effectively mining fea tures from historical sequences, and cross-time learning to capture the temporal dependencies of prediction sequences. Separating these two phases helps avoid the impact of overfitting in cross-time learning on cross-variable learning. Exten sive experiments on various real-world datasets have confirmed its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. CVTN emphasizes three key dimensions in time series fore casting: the short-term and long-term nature of time series (locality and longevity), feature mining from both historical and prediction sequences, and the integration of cross-variable and cross-time learning. This approach not only advances the current state of time series forecasting but also provides a more comprehensive framework for future research in this field.">

        <tr id="Multivariant time series (MTS) data are usually incomplete in real scenarios, and imputing the incomplete MTS is practically important to facilitate various time series mining tasks. Recently, diffusion model-based MTS imputation methods have achieved promising results by utilizing CNN or attention mechanisms for temporal feature learning. However, it is hard to adaptively trade off the diverse effects of local and global temporal features by simply combining CNN and attention. To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.">

The gradual application of the latest architectures of deep learning in the field of time series forecasting (TSF), such as Transformers, has shown excellent performance and results compared to traditional statistical methods.

Deep learning-based TSF tasks stand out as one of the most valuable AI scenarios for research, playing an important role in explaining complex real-world phenomena. However, deep learning models still face challenges: they need to deal with the challenge of large-scale data in the information age, achieve longer forecasting ranges, reduce excessively high computational complexity, etc. Therefore, novel methods and more effective solutions are essential. In this paper, we review the latest developments in deep learning for TSF. We begin by introducing the recent development trends in the field of TSF and then propose a new taxonomy from the perspective of deep neural network models, comprehensively covering articles published over the past five years. We also organize commonly used experimental evaluation metrics and datasets. Finally, we point out current issues with the existing solutions and suggest promising future directions in the field of deep learning combined with TSF.

To address this challenge, we formally reformulate MTSC as a weakly supervised problem, introducing a novel multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework for better localization of patterns of interest and modeling time dependencies within time series. Our novel approach, TimeMIL, formulates the temporal correlation and ordering within a time-aware MIL pooling, leveraging a tokenized transformer with a specialized learnable wavelet positional token.

        <tr id="Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Networks are widely employed in time-series forecasting tasks, demonstrating effectiveness in univariate and certain multivariate scenarios. However, their inherent structure does not readily accommodate the integration of future, time-dependent covariates. A proposed solution, outlined by Salinas et al 2019, suggests forecasting both covariates and the target variable in a multivariate framework. In this study, we conducted comprehensive tests on publicly available time-series datasets, artificially introducing highly correlated covariates to future time-step values. Our evaluation aimed to assess the performance of an LSTM network when considering these covariates and compare it against a univariate baseline. As part of this study we introduce a novel approach using seasonal time segments in combination with an RNN architecture, which is both simple and extremely effective over long forecast horizons with comparable performance to many state of the art architectures. Our findings from the results of more than 120 models reveal that under certain conditions jointly training covariates with target variables can improve overall performance of the model, but often there exists a significant performance disparity between multivariate and univariate predictions. Surprisingly, even when provided with covariates informing the network about future target values, multivariate predictions exhibited inferior performance. In essence, compelling the network to predict multiple values can prove detrimental to model performance, even in the presence of informative covariates. These results suggest that LSTM architectures may not be suitable for forecasting tasks where predicting covariates would typically be expected to enhance model accuracy.">

Conversely, graph transformers (GTs) enable information exchange between all nodes but oversimplify the graph structure by treating them as a set of fixed-length vectors. This work proposes a novel architecture, NeuralWalker, that overcomes the limitations of both methods by combining random walks with message passing. NeuralWalker achieves this by treating random walks as sequences, allowing for the application of recent advances in sequence models in order to capture long-range dependencies within these walks. Based on this concept, we propose a framework that offers (1) more expressive graph representations through random walk sequences, (2) the ability to utilize any sequence model for capturing long-range dependencies, and (3) the flexibility by integrating various GNN and GT architectures. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuralWalker achieves significant performance improvements on 19 graph and node benchmark datasets, notably outperforming existing methods by up to 13% on the PascalVoc-SP and COCO-SP datasets.

Traditional State Space Models (SSMs) are classical approaches for univariate time series modeling due to their simplicity and expressive power to represent linear dependencies. They, however, have fundamentally limited expressive power to capture non-linear dependencies, are slow in practice, and fail to model the inter-variate information flow. Despite recent attempts to improve the expressive power of SSMs by using deep structured SSMs, the existing methods are either limited to univariate time series, fail to model complex patterns (e.g., seasonal patterns), fail to dynamically model the dependencies of variate and time dimensions, and/or are input-independent. We present Chimera that uses two input-dependent 2-D SSM heads with different discretization processes to learn long-term progression and seasonal patterns. To improve the efficiency of complex 2D recurrence, we present a fast training using a new 2-dimensional parallel selective scan. We further present and discuss 2-dimensional Mamba and Mamba-2 as the spacial cases of our 2D SSM.

Therefore, during the time series forecasting process, extracting the local and global time series patterns and understanding the potential nonlinear features among different time observations are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information at different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture potential nonlinear features among time observations. Building upon this, we propose ACNet, an adaptive convolutional network designed to effectively model the local and global temporal dependencies and the nonlinear features between observations in multivariate time series. Specifically, by extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, we capture both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed nonlinear feature adaptive extraction module captures the nonlinear features among different time observations in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ACNet across twelve real-world datasets.

Capturing contextual information from textual data for event forecasting poses significant challenges due to the intricate structure of the documents and the evolving nature of events. Recently, dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been introduced to capture the dynamic patterns of input text graphs. However, these models only utilize node-level representation, causing the loss of the global information from graph-level representation. On the other hand, both node-level and graph-level representations are essential for effective event prediction as node-level representation gives insight into the local structure, and the graph-level representation provides an understanding of the global structure of the temporal graph. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning (DyGCL) method for event prediction. Our model DyGCL employs a local view encoder to learn the evolving node representations, which effectively captures the local dynamic structure of input graphs. Additionally, it harnesses a global view encoder to perceive the hierarchical dynamic graph representation of the input graphs. Then we update the graph representations from both encoders using contrastive learning. In the final stage, DyGCL combines both representations using an attention mechanism and optimizes its capability to predict future events.

        <tr id="Existing approaches for learning representations of time-series keep the temporal arrangement of the time-steps intact with the presumption that the original order is the most optimal for learning. However, non-adjacent sections of real-world time-series may have strong dependencies. Accordingly we raise the question: Is there an alternative arrangement for time-series which could enable more effective representation learning? To address this, we propose a simple plug-and-play mechanism called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3) designed to improve time-series representation learning of existing models. S3 works by creating non-overlapping segments from the original sequence and shuffling them in a learned manner that is the most optimal for the task at hand. It then re-attaches the shuffled segments back together and performs a learned weighted sum with the original input to capture both the newly shuffled sequence along with the original sequence. S3 is modular and can be stacked to create various degrees of granularity, and can be added to many forms of neural architectures including CNNs or Transformers with negligible computation overhead. Through extensive experiments on several datasets and state-of-the-art baselines, we show that incorporating S3 results in significant improvements for the tasks of time-series classification and forecasting, improving performance on certain datasets by up to 68\%. We also show that S3 makes the learning more stable with a smoother training loss curve and loss landscape compared to the original baseline.

While MLP-based models succeed at capturing the moving average and seasonal patterns in data, they struggle with trends and sudden changes. To address this issue, we propose a Univariate Multi-Scale Linear (UMS-Linear) model that leverages timestamps and multi-scale decomposition.

        <tr id="Deep learning has significantly advanced time series forecasting through its powerful capacity to capture sequence relationships. However, training these models with the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss often results in over-smooth predictions, making it challenging to handle the complexity and learn high-entropy features from time series data with high variability and unpredictability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by tokenizing time series values to train forecasting models via cross-entropy loss, while considering the continuous nature of time series data. Specifically, we propose Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network, HCAN, a general model-agnostic component that can be integrated with any forecasting model. HCAN is based on a Hierarchy-Aware Attention module that integrates multi-granularity high-entropy features at different hierarchy levels. At each level, we assign a class label for timesteps to train an Uncertainty-Aware Classifier. This classifier mitigates the over-confidence in softmax loss via evidence theory. We also implement a Hierarchical Consistency Loss to maintain prediction consistency across hierarchy levels. Extensive experiments integrating HCAN with state-of-the-art forecasting models demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines on several real-world datasets.

        <tr id="Time-series data in real-world settings typically exhibit long-range dependencies and are observed at non-uniform intervals. In these settings, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose \textit{multi-view signature attention}, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has become an increasingly popular research area due to its critical applications in various real-world domains such as traffic management, weather prediction, and financial analysis. Despite significant advancements, existing models face notable challenges, including the necessity of manual hyperparameter tuning for different datasets, and difficulty in effectively distinguishing signal from redundant features in data characterized by strong seasonality. These issues hinder the generalization and practical application of time series forecasting models. To solve this issues, we propose an innovative time series forecasting model TimeSieve designed to address these challenges. Our approach employs wavelet transforms to preprocess time series data, effectively capturing multi-scale features without the need for additional parameters or manual hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we introduce the information bottleneck theory that filters out redundant features from both detail and approximation coefficients, retaining only the most predictive information. This combination reduces significantly improves the model's accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 70\% of the datasets, achieving higher predictive accuracy and better generalization across diverse datasets. Our results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the key challenges in time series forecasting, paving the way for more reliable and efficient predictive models in practical applications.

This paper introduces the Adaptive Wavelet Network (AdaWaveNet), a novel approach that employs Adaptive Wavelet Transformation for multi-scale analysis of non-stationary time series data. AdaWaveNet designed a lifting scheme-based wavelet decomposition and construction mechanism for adaptive and learnable wavelet transforms, which offers enhanced flexibility and robustness in analysis.

        <tr id="Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due to the dynamic nature of time-series data, it is crucial to equip TSF models with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities, as historical training data and future test data can have different distributions. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the inherent OOD problem in TSF via invariant learning. We identify fundamental challenges of invariant learning for TSF. First, the target variables in TSF may not be sufficiently determined by the input due to unobserved core variables in TSF, breaking the conventional assumption of invariant learning. Second, time-series datasets lack adequate environment labels, while existing environmental inference methods are not suitable for TSF. To address these challenges, we propose FOIL, a model-agnostic framework that enables timeseries Forecasting for Out-of-distribution generalization via Invariant Learning. FOIL employs a novel surrogate loss to mitigate the impact of unobserved variables. Further, FOIL implements a joint optimization by alternately inferring environments effectively with a multi-head network while preserving the temporal adjacency structure, and learning invariant representations across inferred environments for OOD generalized TSF. We demonstrate that the proposed FOIL significantly improves the performance of various TSF models, achieving gains of up to 85%.">

Moreover, existing graph-specific normalization layers often struggle to offer substantial and consistent benefits. In this paper, we propose GRANOLA, a novel graph-adaptive normalization layer. Unlike existing normalization layers, GRANOLA normalizes node features by adapting to the specific characteristics of the graph, particularly by generating expressive representations of its neighborhood structure, obtained by leveraging the propagation of Random Node Features (RNF) in the graph. We present theoretical results that support our design choices. Our extensive empirical evaluation of various graph benchmarks underscores the superior performance of GRANOLA over existing normalization techniques.

        <tr id="Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation. However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET). Specifically, ICST-DENT consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives. Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road's historical and future traffic conditions. For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations. Extensive experimental results prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.">

Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain.

Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data.

        <tr id="Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learn- ing models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irreg- ular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based mod- els, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experi- ments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.">

        <tr id="Predicting user preferences and sequential dependencies based on historical behavior is the core goal of sequential recommendation. Although attention-based models have shown effectiveness in this field, they often struggle with inference inefficiency due to the quadratic computational complexity inherent in attention mechanisms, especially with long-range behavior sequences. Drawing inspiration from the recent advancements of state space models (SSMs) in control theory, which provide a robust framework for modeling and controlling dynamic systems, we introduce EchoMamba4Rec. Control theory emphasizes the use of SSMs for managing long-range dependencies and maintaining inferential efficiency through structured state matrices. EchoMamba4Rec leverages these control relationships in sequential recommendation and integrates bi-directional processing with frequency-domain filtering to capture complex patterns and dependencies in user interaction data more effectively. Our model benefits from the ability of state space models (SSMs) to learn and perform parallel computations, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and scalability. It features a bi-directional Mamba module that incorporates both forward and reverse Mamba components, leveraging information from both past and future interactions. Additionally, a filter layer operates in the frequency domain using learnable Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and learnable filters, followed by an inverse FFT to refine item embeddings and reduce noise. We also integrate Gate Linear Units (GLU) to dynamically control information flow, enhancing the model's expressiveness and training stability. Experimental results demonstrate that EchoMamba significantly outperforms existing models, providing more accurate and personalized recommendations.">

        <tr id="Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However, the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd, Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures, Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video, audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile, ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast, COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets.

While automatic augmentation has demonstrated success in image classification tasks, its application to time-series problems, particularly in long-term forecasting, has received comparatively less attention. To address this gap, we introduce a time-series automatic augmentation approach named TSAA, which is both efficient and easy to implement. The solution involves tackling the associated bilevel optimization problem through a two-step process: initially training a non-augmented model for a limited number of epochs, followed by an iterative split procedure. During this iterative process, we alternate between identifying a robust augmentation policy through Bayesian optimization and refining the model while discarding suboptimal runs. Extensive evaluations on challenging univariate and multivariate forecasting benchmark problems demonstrate that TSAA consistently outperforms several robust baselines, suggesting its potential integration into prediction pipelines.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of machine learning on non-Euclidean data such as graphs and networks. GNNs effectively implement node representation learning through neighborhood aggregation and achieve impressive results in many graph-related tasks. However, most neighborhood aggregation approaches are summation-based, which can be problematic as they may not be sufficiently expressive to encode informative graph structures. Furthermore, though the graph pooling module is also of vital importance for graph learning, especially for the task of graph classification, research on graph down-sampling mechanisms is rather limited. To address the above challenges, we propose a concatenation-based graph convolution mechanism that injectively updates node representations to maximize the discriminative power in distinguishing non-isomorphic subgraphs. In addition, we design a novel graph pooling module, called WL-SortPool, to learn important subgraph patterns in a deep-learning manner. WL-SortPool layer-wise sorts node representations (i.e. continuous WL colors) to separately learn the relative importance of subtrees with different depths for the purpose of classification, thus better characterizing the complex graph topology and rich information encoded in the graph. We propose a novel Subgraph Pattern GNN (SPGNN) architecture that incorporates these enhancements. We test the proposed SPGNN architecture on many graph classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method can achieve highly competitive results with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other GNN approaches.">

Pre-training Transformers on massive text datasets from the Internet has led to unmatched generalization for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. However, such language models remain fragile when tasked with algorithmic forms of reasoning, where computations must be precise and robust. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that combines the Transformer's language understanding with the robustness of graph neural network (GNN)-based neural algorithmic reasoners (NARs). Such NARs proved effective as generic solvers for algorithmic tasks, when specified in graph form. To make their embeddings accessible to a Transformer, we propose a hybrid architecture with a two-phase training procedure, allowing the tokens in the language model to cross-attend to the node embeddings from the NAR. We evaluate our resulting TransNAR model on CLRS-Text, the text-based version of the CLRS-30 benchmark, and demonstrate significant gains over Transformer-only models for algorithmic reasoning, both in and out of distribution.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have attempted to refine the Transformer architecture to demonstrate its effectiveness in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Despite surpassing many linear forecasting models with ever-improving performance, we remain skeptical of Transformers as a solution for LTSF. We attribute the effectiveness of these models largely to the adopted Patch mechanism, which enhances sequence locality to an extent yet fails to fully address the loss of temporal information inherent to the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism. Further investigation suggests that simple linear layers augmented with the Patch mechanism may outperform complex Transformer-based LTSF models. Moreover, diverging from models that use channel independence, our research underscores the importance of cross-variable interactions in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series forecasting. The interaction information between variables is highly valuable but has been misapplied in past studies, leading to suboptimal cross-variable models. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and simple Patch-based Decomposed MLP (PDMLP) for LTSF tasks. Specifically, we employ simple moving averages to extract smooth components and noise-containing residuals from time series data, engaging in semantic information interchange through channel mixing and specializing in random noise with channel independence processing. The PDMLP model consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several real-world datasets. We hope this surprising finding will spur new research directions in the LTSF field and pave the way for more efficient and concise solutions.">

To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet practical objective function for time series explainable learning. The design of the objective function builds upon the principle of information bottleneck (IB), and modifies the IB objective function to avoid trivial solutions and distributional shift issues.

For example, dynamic relationship networks between companies that evolve across time due to changes in business strategies and alliances, which are associated with dynamic company attributes from multiple modalities such as textual online news, categorical events, and numerical financial-related data. Such information can be useful in predictive tasks involving companies. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings of companies are important for assessing the sustainability risks of companies. The process of generating ESG ratings by expert analysts is however laborious and time-intensive. We thus explore the use of dynamic multimodal networks extracted from the web for forecasting ESG ratings. Learning such dynamic multimodal networks from the web for forecasting ESG ratings is however challenging due to its heterogeneity, and the low signal-to-noise ratios and non-stationary distributions of web information. Human analysts cope with such issues by learning concepts from past experience through relational thinking, and scanning for such concepts when analyzing new information about a company. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Multimodal Slot Concept Attention-based Network (DynScan) model. DynScan utilizes slot attention mechanisms together with slot concept alignment and disentanglement loss functions to learn latent slot concepts from dynamic multimodal networks to improve performance on ESG rating forecasting tasks. DynScan is evaluated on forecasting tasks on six data sets, comprising three ESG ratings across two sets of companies. Our experiments show that DynScan outperforms other state-of-the-art models on these forecasting tasks. We also visualize the slot concepts learnt by DynScan on five synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets and observe distinct and meaningful slot concepts being learnt by DynScan across both synthetic and real-world datasets.">

        <tr id="Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

        <tr id="This work proposes a time series prediction method based on the kernel view of linear reservoirs. In particular, the time series motifs of the reservoir kernel are used as representational basis on which general readouts are constructed. We provide a geometric interpretation of our approach shedding light on how our approach is related to the core reservoir models and in what way the two approaches differ. Empirical experiments then compare predictive performances of our suggested model with those of recent state-of-art transformer based models, as well as the established recurrent network model - LSTM. The experiments are performed on both univariate and multivariate time series and with a variety of prediction horizons. Rather surprisingly we show that even when linear readout is employed, our method has the capacity to outperform transformer models on univariate time series and attain competitive results on multivariate benchmark datasets. We conclude that simple models with easily controllable capacity but capturing enough memory and subsequence structure can outperform potentially over-complicated deep learning models. This does not mean that reservoir motif based models are preferable to other more complex alternatives - rather, when introducing a new complex time series model one should employ as a sanity check simple, but potentially powerful alternatives/baselines such as reservoir models or the models introduced here.">

        <tr id="Most forecasting methods use recent past observations (lags) to model the future values of univariate time series. Selecting an adequate number of lags is important for training accurate forecasting models. Several approaches and heuristics have been devised to solve this task. However, there is no consensus about what the best approach is. Besides, lag selection procedures have been developed based on local models and classical forecasting techniques such as ARIMA. We bridge this gap in the literature by carrying out an extensive empirical analysis of different lag selection methods. We focus on deep learning methods trained in a global approach, i.e., on datasets comprising multiple univariate time series. The experiments were carried out using three benchmark databases that contain a total of 2411 univariate time series. The results indicate that the lag size is a relevant parameter for accurate forecasts. In particular, excessively small or excessively large lag sizes have a considerable negative impact on forecasting performance. Cross-validation approaches show the best performance for lag selection, but this performance is comparable with simple heuristics.">

However, learning comprehensive region representations presents two significant challenges: first, the deficiency of effective intra-region feature representation; and second, the difficulty of learning from intricate inter-region dependencies. In this paper, we present GeoHG, an effective heterogeneous graph structure for learning comprehensive region embeddings for various downstream tasks. Specifically, we tailor satellite image representation learning through geo-entity segmentation and point-of-interest (POI) integration for expressive intra-regional features. Furthermore, GeoHG unifies informative spatial interdependencies and socio-environmental attributes into a powerful heterogeneous graph to encourage explicit modeling of higher-order inter-regional relationships. The intra-regional features and inter-regional correlations are seamlessly integrated by a model-agnostic graph learning framework for diverse downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoHG in geo-prediction tasks compared to existing methods, even under extreme data scarcity (with just 5% of training data). With interpretable region representations, GeoHG exhibits strong generalization capabilities across regions. We will release code and data upon paper notification.">

        <tr id="Accurate traffic flow forecasting is a crucial research topic in transportation management. However, it is a challenging problem due to rapidly changing traffic conditions, high nonlinearity of traffic flow, and complex spatial and temporal correlations of road networks. Most existing studies either try to capture the spatial dependencies between roads using the same semantic graph over different time steps, or assume all sensors on the roads are equally likely to be connected regardless of the distance between them. However, we observe that the spatial dependencies between roads indeed change over time, and two distant roads are not likely to be helpful to each other when predicting the traffic flow, both of which limit the performance of existing studies. In this paper, we propose Temporal Graph Learning Recurrent Neural Network (TGLRN) to address these problems. More precisely, to effectively model the nature of time series, we leverage Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to dynamically construct a graph at each time step, thereby capturing the time-evolving spatial dependencies between roads (i.e., microscopic view). Simultaneously, we provide the Adaptive Structure Information to the model, ensuring that close and consecutive sensors are considered to be more important for predicting the traffic flow (i.e., macroscopic view). Furthermore, to endow TGLRN with robustness, we introduce an edge sampling strategy when constructing the graph at each time step, which eventually leads to further improvements on the model performance. Experimental results on four commonly used real-world benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of TGLRN.">

To extract local geometric features simultaneously, we design a parallel branch to encode the point cloud efficiently in a fixed radius near-neighbors graph with a graph stabilizer. Furthermore, we design PointRWKV as a multi-scale framework for hierarchical feature learning of 3D point clouds, facilitating various downstream tasks.

        <tr id="The accurate prediction of stock movements is crucial for investment strategies. Stock prices are subject to the influence of various forms of information, including financial indicators, sentiment analysis, news documents, and relational structures. Predominant analytical approaches, however, tend to address only unimodal or bimodal sources, neglecting the complexity of multimodal data. Further complicating the landscape are the issues of data sparsity and semantic conflicts between these modalities, which are frequently overlooked by current models, leading to unstable performance and limiting practical applicability. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a novel architecture, named Multimodal Stable Fusion with Gated Cross-Attention (MSGCA), designed to robustly integrate multimodal input for stock movement prediction. The MSGCA framework consists of three integral components: (1) a trimodal encoding module, responsible for processing indicator sequences, dynamic documents, and a relational graph, and standardizing their feature representations; (2) a cross-feature fusion module, where primary and consistent features guide the multimodal fusion of the three modalities via a pair of gated cross-attention networks; and (3) a prediction module, which refines the fused features through temporal and dimensional reduction to execute precise movement forecasting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the MSGCA framework exceeds current leading methods, achieving performance gains of 8.1%, 6.1%, 21.7% and 31.6% on four multimodal datasets, respectively, attributed to its enhanced multimodal fusion stability.">

        <tr id="Objective This study focuses on enhancing the precision of epidemic time series data prediction by integrating Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) into a Graph Neural Network (GNN), forming the GRGNN. The accuracy of the GNN (Graph Neural Network) network with introduced GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) is validated by comparing it with seven commonly used prediction methods. Method The GRGNN methodology involves multivariate time series prediction using a GNN (Graph Neural Network) network improved by the integration of GRU (Gated Recurrent Units). Additionally, Graphical Fourier Transform (GFT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) are introduced. GFT captures inter-sequence correlations in the spectral domain, while DFT transforms data from the time domain to the frequency domain, revealing temporal node correlations. Following GFT and DFT, outbreak data are predicted through one-dimensional convolution and gated linear regression in the frequency domain, graph convolution in the spectral domain, and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) in the time domain. The inverse transformation of GFT and DFT is employed, and final predictions are obtained after passing through a fully connected layer. Evaluation is conducted on three datasets: the COVID-19 datasets of 38 African countries and 42 European countries from worldometers, and the chickenpox dataset of 20 Hungarian regions from Kaggle. Metrics include Average Root Mean Square Error (ARMSE) and Average Mean Absolute Error (AMAE). Result For African COVID-19 dataset and Hungarian Chickenpox dataset, GRGNN consistently outperforms other methods in ARMSE and AMAE across various prediction step lengths. Optimal results are achieved even at extended prediction steps, highlighting the model’s robustness. Conclusion GRGNN proves effective in predicting epidemic time series data with high accuracy, demonstrating its potential in epidemic surveillance and early warning applications. However, further discussions and studies are warranted to refine its application and judgment methods, emphasizing the ongoing need for exploration and research in this domain.">

To assess their efficacy, models are evaluated on publicly available benchmark datasets involving continuous-time and discrete-time temporal graphs. However, as we show in this work, the suitability of common batch-oriented evaluation depends on the datasets' characteristics, which can cause two issues: First, for continuous-time temporal graphs, fixed-size batches create time windows with different durations, resulting in an inconsistent dynamic link prediction task. Second, for discrete-time temporal graphs, the sequence of batches can additionally introduce temporal dependencies that are not present in the data. In this work, we empirically show that this common evaluation approach leads to skewed model performance and hinders the fair comparison of methods. We mitigate this problem by reformulating dynamic link prediction as a link forecasting task that better accounts for temporal information present in the data.

Our model introduces two key innovations: first, a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is employed to effectively capture time series data characteristics, bypassing the traditional decomposition into trend and seasonal components. Second, a multi-level fusion structure is developed to integrate deep and shallow features seamlessly. Empirically, FPN-fusion outperforms DLiner in 31 out of 32 test cases on eight open-source datasets, with an average reduction of 16.8% in mean squared error (MSE) and 11.8% in mean absolute error (MAE). Additionally, compared to the transformer-based PatchTST, FPN-fusion achieves 10 best MSE and 15 best MAE results, using only 8% of PatchTST's total computational load in the 32 test projects.">

        <tr id="Limited by the scale and diversity of time series data, the neural networks trained on time series data often overfit and show unsatisfacotry performances. In comparison, large language models (LLMs) recently exhibit impressive generalization in diverse fields. Although massive LLM based approaches are proposed for time series tasks, these methods require to load the whole LLM in both training and reference. This high computational demands limit practical applications in resource-constrained settings, like edge-computing and IoT devices. To address this issue, we propose Knowledge Pruning (KP), a novel paradigm for time series learning in this paper. For a specific downstream task, we argue that the world knowledge learned by LLMs is much redundant and only the related knowledge termed as"pertinent knowledge"is useful. Unlike other methods, our KP targets to prune the redundant knowledge and only distill the pertinent knowledge into the target model. This reduces model size and computational costs significantly. Additionally, different from existing LLM based approaches, our KP does not require to load the LLM in the process of training and testing, further easing computational burdens. With our proposed KP, a lightweight network can effectively learn the pertinent knowledge, achieving satisfactory performances with a low computation cost. To verify the effectiveness of our KP, two fundamental tasks on edge-computing devices are investigated in our experiments, where eight diverse environments or benchmarks with different networks are used to verify the generalization of our KP. Through experiments, our KP demonstrates effective learning of pertinent knowledge, achieving notable performance improvements in regression (19.7% on average) and classification (up to 13.7%) tasks, showcasing state-of-the-art results.">

        <tr id="Deep learning approaches are increasingly used to tackle forecasting tasks. A key factor in the successful application of these methods is a large enough training sample size, which is not always available. In these scenarios, synthetic data generation techniques are usually applied to augment the dataset. Data augmentation is typically applied before fitting a model. However, these approaches create a single augmented dataset, potentially limiting their effectiveness. This work introduces OnDAT (On-the-fly Data Augmentation for Time series) to address this issue by applying data augmentation during training and validation. Contrary to traditional methods that create a single, static augmented dataset beforehand, OnDAT performs augmentation on-the-fly. By generating a new augmented dataset on each iteration, the model is exposed to a constantly changing augmented data variations. We hypothesize this process enables a better exploration of the data space, which reduces the potential for overfitting and improves forecasting performance. We validated the proposed approach using a state-of-the-art deep learning forecasting method and 8 benchmark datasets containing a total of 75797 time series. The experiments suggest that OnDAT leads to better forecasting performance than a strategy that applies data augmentation before training as well as a strategy that does not involve data augmentation. The method and experiments are publicly available.">

        <tr id="Inductive representation learning on temporal heterogeneous graphs is crucial for scalable deep learning on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) which are time-varying, such as citation networks. However, most existing approaches are not inductive and thus cannot handle new nodes or edges. Moreover, previous temporal graph embedding methods are often trained with the temporal link prediction task to simulate the link formation process of temporal graphs, while ignoring the evolution of high-order topological structures on temporal graphs. To fill these gaps, we propose a Continuous-Time Representation Learning (CTRL) model on temporal HINs. To preserve heterogeneous node features and temporal structures, CTRL integrates three parts in a single layer, they are 1) a \emph{heterogeneous attention} unit that measures the semantic correlation between nodes, 2) a \emph{edge-based Hawkes process} to capture temporal influence between heterogeneous nodes, and 3) \emph{dynamic centrality} that indicates the dynamic importance of a node. We train the CTRL model with a future event (a subgraph) prediction task to capture the evolution of the high-order network structure. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our model significantly boosts performance and outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model design.">

Data-driven approaches based on machine learning models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to numerical weather prediction models given their potential to capture physics of different scales from historical data and the significantly lower computational cost during the prediction stage. Renowned for its state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, the Transformer model has also gained popularity in machine learning weather prediction. Yet applying Transformer architectures to weather forecasting, particularly on a global scale is computationally challenging due to the quadratic complexity of attention and the quadratic increase in spatial points as resolution increases. In this work, we propose a factorized-attention-based model tailored for spherical geometries to mitigate this issue. More specifically, it utilizes multi-dimensional factorized kernels that convolve over different axes where the computational complexity of the kernel is only quadratic to the axial resolution instead of overall resolution. The deterministic forecasting accuracy of the proposed model on $1.5^\circ$ and 0-7 days' lead time is on par with state-of-the-art purely data-driven machine learning weather prediction models. We also showcase the proposed model holds great potential to push forward the Pareto front of accuracy-efficiency for Transformer weather models, where it can achieve better accuracy with less computational cost compared to Transformer based models with standard attention.">

In this work, we propose Mulan, a unified multi-modal causal structure learning method designed to identify root causes in microservice systems. We leverage a log-tailored language model to facilitate log representation learning, converting log sequences into time-series data. To explore intricate relationships across different modalities, we propose a contrastive learning-based approach to extract modality-invariant and modality-specific representations within a shared latent space. Additionally, we introduce a novel key performance indicator-aware attention mechanism for assessing modality reliability and co-learning a final causal graph. Finally, we employ random walk with restart to simulate system fault propagation and identify potential root causes.

Recently, some studies have exploited Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to impute/fill the missing values in multivariate time-series data. However, when faced with datasets with high missing rates, the imputation error of these methods increases dramatically. To this end, we propose a neural network model based on dynamic contribution and attention, denoted as ContrAttNet. ContrAttNet consists of three novel modules: feature attention module, iLSTM (imputation Long Short-Term Memory) module, and 1D-CNN (1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network) module. ContrAttNet exploits temporal information and spatial feature information to predict missing values, where iLSTM attenuates the memory of LSTM according to the characteristics of the missing values, to learn the contributions of different features. Moreover, the feature attention module introduces an attention mechanism based on contributions, to calculate supervised weights. Furthermore, under the influence of these supervised weights, 1D-CNN processes the time-series data by treating them as spatial features. Experimental results show that ContrAttNet outperforms other state-of-the-art models in the missing value imputation of multivariate time-series data, with average 6% MAPE and 9% MAE on the benchmark datasets.">

Despite their successes, GNNs are limited by neglecting the context of relationships across graphs, i.e., inter-graph relationships. Recognizing the potential to extend this capability, we introduce Relating-Up, a plug-and-play module that enhances GNNs by exploiting inter-graph relationships. This module incorporates a relation-aware encoder and a feedback training strategy. The former enables GNNs to capture relationships across graphs, enriching relation-aware graph representation through collective context. The latter utilizes a feedback loop mechanism for the recursively refinement of these representations, leveraging insights from refining inter-graph dynamics to conduct feedback loop. The synergy between these two innovations results in a robust and versatile module. Relating-Up enhances the expressiveness of GNNs, enabling them to encapsulate a wider spectrum of graph relationships with greater precision.

Yet, despite the promising results, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models (SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying continuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention and achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In this work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to temporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online approximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term.

However, this would not be possible for structure property prediction tasks unless an effective method is found to pass atomic-level geometric features to the transformer model. To address this problem, we employ a compound model in which GPT-2 acts on the output of geometry-aware graph neural networks to adapt in-context information.

        <tr id="Traffic prediction is pivotal for rational transportation supply scheduling and allocation. Existing researches into short-term traffic prediction, however, face challenges in adequately addressing exceptional circumstances and integrating non-numerical contextual information like weather into models. While, Large language models offer a promising solution due to their inherent world knowledge. However, directly using them for traffic prediction presents drawbacks such as high cost, lack of determinism, and limited mathematical capability. To mitigate these issues, this study proposes a novel approach. Instead of directly employing large models for prediction, it utilizes them to process textual information and obtain embeddings. These embeddings are then combined with historical traffic data and inputted into traditional spatiotemporal forecasting models. The study investigates two types of special scenarios: regional-level and node-level. For regional-level scenarios, textual information is represented as a node connected to the entire network. For node-level scenarios, embeddings from the large model represent additional nodes connected only to corresponding nodes. This approach shows a significant improvement in prediction accuracy according to our experiment of New York Bike dataset.">

        <tr id="In recent years, deep learning on graphs has achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, the reliance on annotated graph data remains a significant bottleneck due to its prohibitive cost and time-intensive nature. To address this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs has gained increasing attention and has made significant progress. SSL enables machine learning models to produce informative representations from unlabeled graph data, reducing the reliance on expensive labeled data. While SSL on graphs has witnessed widespread adoption, one critical component, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), has not been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. Thus, this survey aims to fill this gap by offering a dedicated survey on GCL. We provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles of GCL, including data augmentation strategies, contrastive modes, and contrastive optimization objectives. Furthermore, we explore the extensions of GCL to other aspects of data-efficient graph learning, such as weakly supervised learning, transfer learning, and related scenarios. We also discuss practical applications spanning domains such as drug discovery, genomics analysis, recommender systems, and finally outline the challenges and potential future directions in this field.">

Mainstream pre-trained models like DNABERT-2 and Nucleotide Transformer have demonstrated remarkable achievements across a spectrum of DNA analysis tasks. Yet, these models still face the pivotal challenge of (1) genetic language diversity, or the capability to capture genetic variations across individuals or populations in the foundation models; (2) model efficiency, specifically how to enhance performance at scalable costs for large-scale genetic foundational models; (3) length extrapolation, or the ability to accurately interpret sequences ranging from short to long within a unified model framework. In response, we introduce DeepGene, a model leveraging Pan-genome and Minigraph representations to encompass the broad diversity of genetic language. DeepGene employs the rotary position embedding to improve the length extrapolation in various genetic analysis tasks. On the 28 tasks in Genome Understanding Evaluation, DeepGene reaches the top position in 9 tasks, second in 5, and achieves the overall best score. DeepGene outperforms other cutting-edge models for its compact model size and superior efficiency in processing sequences of varying lengths.

By relating the parameters of a target time series model to features, Hyper-Trees address the issue of parameter non-stationarity and enable tree-based forecasts to extend beyond their training range.

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for graph classification. One important operation for GNNs is the downsampling or pooling that can learn effective embeddings from the node representations. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical pooling operation, namely the Edge-Node Attention-based Differentiable Pooling (ENADPool), for GNNs to learn effective graph representations. Unlike the classical hierarchical pooling operation that is based on the unclear node assignment and simply computes the averaged feature over the nodes of each cluster, the proposed ENADPool not only employs a hard clustering strategy to assign each node into an unique cluster, but also compress the node features as well as their edge connectivity strengths into the resulting hierarchical structure based on the attention mechanism after each pooling step. As a result, the proposed ENADPool simultaneously identifies the importance of different nodes within each separated cluster and edges between corresponding clusters, that significantly addresses the shortcomings of the uniform edge-node based structure information aggregation arising in the classical hierarchical pooling operation. Moreover, to mitigate the over-smoothing problem arising in existing GNNs, we propose a Multi-distance GNN (MD-GNN) model associated with the proposed ENADPool operation, allowing the nodes to actively and directly receive the feature information from neighbors at different random walk steps. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MD-GNN associated with the proposed ENADPool.">

        <tr id="This paper presents the Block Transformer architecture which adopts hierarchical global-to-local modeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks of self-attention. To apply self-attention, the key-value (KV) cache of all previous sequences must be retrieved from memory at every decoding step. Thereby, this KV cache IO becomes a significant bottleneck in batch inference. We notice that these costs stem from applying self-attention on the global context, therefore we isolate the expensive bottlenecks of global modeling to lower layers and apply fast local modeling in upper layers. To mitigate the remaining costs in the lower layers, we aggregate input tokens into fixed size blocks and then apply self-attention at this coarse level. Context information is aggregated into a single embedding to enable upper layers to decode the next block of tokens, without global attention. Free of global attention bottlenecks, the upper layers can fully utilize the compute hardware to maximize inference throughput. By leveraging global and local modules, the Block Transformer architecture demonstrates 10-20x gains in inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent perplexity. Our work introduces a new approach to optimize language model inference through novel application of global-to-local modeling. Code is available at https://github.com/itsnamgyu/block-transformer.">

        <tr id="Recent state-of-the-art forecasting methods are trained on collections of time series. These methods, often referred to as global models, can capture common patterns in different time series to improve their generalization performance. However, they require large amounts of data that might not be readily available. Besides this, global models sometimes fail to capture relevant patterns unique to a particular time series. In these cases, data augmentation can be useful to increase the sample size of time series datasets. The main contribution of this work is a novel method for generating univariate time series synthetic samples. Our approach stems from the insight that the observations concerning a particular time series of interest represent only a small fraction of all observations. In this context, we frame the problem of training a forecasting model as an imbalanced learning task. Oversampling strategies are popular approaches used to deal with the imbalance problem in machine learning. We use these techniques to create synthetic time series observations and improve the accuracy of forecasting models. We carried out experiments using 7 different databases that contain a total of 5502 univariate time series. We found that the proposed solution outperforms both a global and a local model, thus providing a better trade-off between these two approaches.">

        <tr id="A promising approach to preserving model performance in linearized transformers is to employ position-based re-weighting functions. However, state-of-the-art re-weighting functions rely heavily on target sequence lengths, making it difficult or impossible to apply them to autoregressive and simultaneous tasks, where the target and sometimes even the input sequence length are unknown. To address this issue, we propose Learned Proportions (LeaP) and LeaPformers. Our contribution is built on two major components. First, we generalize the dependence on explicit positional representations and sequence lengths into dependence on sequence proportions for re-weighting. Second, we replace static positional representations with dynamic proportions derived via a compact module, enabling more flexible attention concentration patterns. We evaluate LeaPformer against eight representative efficient transformers on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, showing that LeaPformer achieves the best quality-throughput trade-off, as well as LeaPformer to Wikitext-103 autoregressive language modeling and simultaneous speech-to-text translation for two language pairs, achieving competitive results.">

        <tr id="Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a key tool in identifying optimal configurations of deep neural networks tailored to specific tasks. However, training and assessing numerous architectures introduces considerable computational overhead. One method to mitigating this is through performance predictors, which offer a means to estimate the potential of an architecture without exhaustive training. Given that neural architectures fundamentally resemble Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) become an apparent choice for such predictive tasks. Nevertheless, the scarcity of training data can impact the precision of GNN-based predictors. To address this, we introduce a novel GNN predictor for NAS. This predictor renders neural architectures into vector representations by combining both the conventional and inverse graph views. Additionally, we incorporate a customized training loss within the GNN predictor to ensure efficient utilization of both types of representations. We subsequently assessed our method through experiments on benchmark datasets including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and the DARTS search space, with a training dataset ranging from 50 to 400 samples. Benchmarked against leading GNN predictors, the experimental results showcase a significant improvement in prediction accuracy, with a 3%--16% increase in Kendall-tau correlation.

Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future works.\footnote{Codes for our experiments will be made public at: \url{https://github.com/JingzheShi/ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting}.">

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel causal inference model, namely the Independent and Confounded Causal Model (ICCM).

        <tr id="Numerous real-world networks are represented as temporal graphs, which capture the dynamics of connections over time. Identifying important nodes on temporal graphs has a plethora of real-life applications, such as information propagation and influential user identification, etc. Temporal Katz centrality, a popular temporal metric, gauges the importance of nodes by taking into account both the number of temporal walks and the timespan between the interactions. The computation of traditional temporal Katz centrality is computationally expensive, especially when applied to massive temporal graphs. Therefore, in this paper, we design a temporal graph neural network to approximate temporal Katz centrality computation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address temporal Katz centrality computation purely from a learning-based perspective. We propose a time-injected self-attention model that consists of two phases. In the first phase, we utilize a time-injected self-attention mechanism to acquire node representations that encompass both structural information and temporal relevance. The second phase is structured as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) which uses the learned node representation to predict node rankings. Furthermore, normalization and neighbor sampling strategies are integrated into the model to enhance its overall performance. Extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of TATKC.">

        <tr id="Accurate customer LifeTime Value (LTV) predictions are crucial for customer relationship management, especially in Supply Chain Platforms (SCP), which involve effectively managing the service resources in business decision-making. Previous LTV prediction methods usually rely on ample historical customer data, which is not available in the early stages of a customer's lifecycle. It makes the modeling of the historical customer data a difficult task due to the data sparsity. Besides, the long-tail distribution of customer LTV also brings new challenges to the prediction of LTV. To tackle the above issues, we propose CDLtvS, a novel Cross Domain method for customer Lifetime value prediction in SCP. It leverages rich cross-domain information from upstream platforms to enhance LTV predictions in downstream platforms. Firstly, CDLtvS pre-trains the customer representations by an LTV modeling framework named LtvS in source and target domains separately. Specifically, LtvS incorporates the Expert Mask Network (ExMN), which not only effectively models the long-tail distribution of LTV in single-domain but also resolves cross-domain learning model bias resulting from this distribution. Then, the various-level alignment mechanism is introduced to keep the consistency of knowledge transferring from source to target domains on both sparse and non-sparse data. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data from JD, one of the world's largest supply chain platforms, demonstrate that CDLtvS achieves a normalized mean average error of 0.3378 in LTV prediction, outperforming 16.3% to the baseline. Additionally, the improvements of ≥2.3% across various data sparsity levels (0% -- 80%) provide valuable insights into cross-domain LTV modeling.">

Recent advances attempt to incorporate prior physical knowledge into the deep learning framework to estimate the unknown governing partial differential equations (PDEs), which have shown promising results in spatiotemporal prediction tasks. However, previous approaches only restrict neural network architectures or loss functions to acquire physical or PDE features, which decreases the representative capacity of a neural network. Meanwhile, the updating process of the physical state cannot be effectively estimated. To solve the above mentioned problems, this paper proposes a physical-guided neural network, which utilizes the frequency-enhanced Fourier module and moment loss to strengthen the model's ability to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive second-order Runge-Kutta method with physical constraints to model the physical states more precisely. We evaluate our model on both spatiotemporal and video prediction tasks. The experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and performs best in several datasets, with a much smaller parameter count.">

        <tr id="Recent works have introduced GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation (KD) frameworks to combine both GNN's superior performance and MLP's fast inference speed. However, existing KD frameworks are primarily designed for node classification within single graphs, leaving their applicability to graph classification largely unexplored. Two main challenges arise when extending KD for node classification to graph classification: (1) The inherent sparsity of learning signals due to soft labels being generated at the graph level; (2) The limited expressiveness of student MLPs, especially in datasets with limited input feature spaces. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MuGSI, a novel KD framework that employs Multi-granularity Structural Information for graph classification. Specifically, we propose multi-granularity distillation loss in MuGSI to tackle the first challenge. This loss function is composed of three distinct components: graph-level distillation, subgraph-level distillation, and node-level distillation. Each component targets a specific granularity of the graph structure, ensuring a comprehensive transfer of structural knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. To tackle the second challenge, MuGSI proposes to incorporate a node feature augmentation component, thereby enhancing the expressiveness of the student MLPs and making them more capable learners. We perform extensive experiments across a variety of datasets and different teacher/student model architectures. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of MuGSI. Codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/tianyao-aka/MuGSI.">

        <tr id="Subgraph federated learning (subgraph-FL) is a new distributed paradigm that facilitates the collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client subgraphs. Unfortunately, a significant challenge of subgraph-FL arises from subgraph heterogeneity, which stems from node and topology variation, causing the impaired performance of the global GNN. Despite various studies, they have not yet thoroughly investigated the impact mechanism of subgraph heterogeneity. To this end, we decouple node and topology variation, revealing that they correspond to differences in label distribution and structure homophily. Remarkably, these variations lead to significant differences in the class-wise knowledge reliability of multiple local GNNs, misguiding the model aggregation with varying degrees. Building on this insight, we propose topology-aware data-free knowledge distillation technology (FedTAD), enhancing reliable knowledge transfer from the local model to the global model. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedTAD over state-of-the-art baselines.">

        <tr id="In recent years, Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved great success in learning tasks for graphs that change over time. These dynamic/temporal graphs represent topology changes as either discrete static graph snapshots (called DTDGs), or a continuous stream of timestamped edges (called CTDGs). Because continuous-time graphs have richer time information, it will be crucial to have abstractions for programming CTDG-based models so that practitioners can easily explore new designs and optimizations in this space. A few recent frameworks have been proposed for programming and accelerating TGNN models, but these either do not support continuous-time graphs, lack easy composability, and/or do not facilitate CTDG-specific optimizations. In this paper, we propose a lightweight framework called TGLite to fill this apparent gap in the status quo. It provides abstractions that serve as composable building blocks for implementing TGNN models for CTDGs. It introduces a novel TBlock representation for capturing message-flow dependencies between nodes, with explicit support for temporal-related attributes, which is well-suited for common TGNN computation patterns. TBlocks serve as a central representation on which many different operators can be defined, such as temporal neighborhood sampling, scatter/segmented computations, as well as optimizations tailored to CTDGs. We use TGLite to implement four existing TGNN models. Compared to the TGL framework, TGLite is able to accelerate runtime performance of training (1.06 -- 3.43×) and inference (1.09 -- 4.65×) of these models on V100 and A100 GPUs across different experimental settings. Notably, when scaling to larger datasets, TGL runs out-of-memory in some cases on the V100 while TGLite is able to run successfully.">

Besides intensive computational requirements, conventional DSSE methods need high-quality measurements to obtain accurate states, whereas missing values often occur due to sensor failures or communication delays. To address these challenging issues, a forecast-then-estimate framework of edge learning is proposed for DSSE, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to forecast missing measurements and provide pseudo-measurements. Firstly, natural language-based prompts and measurement sequences are integrated by the proposed LLM to learn patterns from historical data and provide accurate forecasting results. Secondly, a convolutional layer-based neural network model is introduced to improve the robustness of state estimation under missing measurement. Thirdly, to alleviate the overfitting of the deep learning-based DSSE, it is reformulated as a multi-task learning framework containing shared and task-specific layers. The uncertainty weighting algorithm is applied to find the optimal weights to balance different tasks. The numerical simulation on the Simbench case is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forecast-then-estimate framework.">

        <tr id="In recent years, the field of action recognition using spatio-temporal graph convolution models for human skeletal data has made significant progress. However, current methodologies tend to prioritize spatial graph convolution, which leads to an underutilization of valuable information present in skeletal data. It limits the model’s ability to effectively capture complex data patterns, especially in time-series data, ultimately impacting recognition accuracy significantly. To address the above issues, this article introduces an attention-based semantic-guided multistream graph convolution network (ASMGCN), which can extract the deep features in skeletal data more fully. Specifically, ASMGCN incorporates a novel temporal convolutional module featuring an attention mechanism and a multiscale residual network, which can dynamically adjust the weights between skeleton graphs at different time points, enabling better capture of relational features. In addition, semantic information is introduced into the loss function, enhancing the model’s ability to distinguish similar actions. Furthermore, the coordinate information of different joints within the same frame is explored to generate new relative position features known as centripetal and centrifugal streams based on the center of gravity. These features are integrated with the original position and motion features of skeleton, including joints and bones, enriching the inputs to the GCN. Experimental results on the NW-UCLA, NTU RGB + D (NTU60), and NTU RGB + D 120 (NTU120) datasets demonstrate that ASMGCN outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) human action recognition (HAR) methods, signifying its potential in advancing the field of action recognition using skeletal data.">

However, prior work has shown that the data can actually be recovered by the server using so-called gradient inversion attacks. While these attacks perform well when applied on images, they are limited in the text domain and only permit approximate reconstruction of small batches and short input sequences. In this work, we propose DAGER, the first algorithm to recover whole batches of input text exactly. DAGER leverages the low-rank structure of self-attention layer gradients and the discrete nature of token embeddings to efficiently check if a given token sequence is part of the client data. We use this check to exactly recover full batches in the honest-but-curious setting without any prior on the data for both encoder- and decoder-based architectures using exhaustive heuristic search and a greedy approach, respectively. We provide an efficient GPU implementation of DAGER and show experimentally that it recovers full batches of size up to 128 on large language models (LLMs), beating prior attacks in speed (20x at same batch size), scalability (10x larger batches), and reconstruction quality (ROUGE-1/2>0.99).">

Diffusion generative models, as an emerging research focus, have been applied to graph generation tasks. Overall, according to the space of states and time steps, diffusion generative models can be categorized into discrete-/continuous-state discrete-/continuous-time fashions. In this paper, we formulate the graph diffusion generation in a discrete-state continuous-time setting, which has never been studied in previous graph diffusion models. The rationale of such a formulation is to preserve the discrete nature of graph-structured data and meanwhile provide flexible sampling trade-offs between sample quality and efficiency. Analysis shows that our training objective is closely related to generation quality, and our proposed generation framework enjoys ideal invariant/equivariant properties concerning the permutation of node ordering. Our proposed model shows competitive empirical performance against state-of-the-art graph generation solutions on various benchmarks and, at the same time, can flexibly trade off the generation quality and efficiency in the sampling phase.">

        <tr id="Large Generative Models (LGMs) such as GPT, Stable Diffusion, Sora, and Suno are trained on a huge amount of language corpus, images, videos, and audio that are extremely diverse from numerous domains. This training paradigm over diverse well-curated data lies at the heart of generating creative and sensible content. However, all previous graph generative models (e.g., GraphRNN, MDVAE, MoFlow, GDSS, and DiGress) have been trained only on one dataset each time, which cannot replicate the revolutionary success achieved by LGMs in other fields. To remedy this crucial gap, we propose a new class of graph generative model called Large Graph Generative Model (LGGM) that is trained on a large corpus of graphs (over 5000 graphs) from 13 different domains. We empirically demonstrate that the pre-trained LGGM has superior zero-shot generative capability to existing graph generative models. Furthermore, our pre-trained LGGM can be easily fine-tuned with graphs from target domains and demonstrate even better performance than those directly trained from scratch, behaving as a solid starting point for real-world customization. Inspired by Stable Diffusion, we further equip LGGM with the capability to generate graphs given text prompts (Text-to-Graph), such as the description of the network name and domain (i.e.,"The power-1138-bus graph represents a network of buses in a power distribution system."), and network statistics (i.e.,"The graph has a low average degree, suitable for modeling social media interactions."). This Text-to-Graph capability integrates the extensive world knowledge in the underlying language model, offering users fine-grained control of the generated graphs. We release the code, the model checkpoint, and the datasets at https://lggm-lg.github.io/.">

The evolution of deep learning methods for time series prediction has progressed from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to the recently popularized Transformer network. However, each of these methods has encountered specific issues. Recent studies have questioned the effectiveness of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers for time series prediction, prompting a reevaluation of approaches to LTSF (Long Time Series Forecasting) problems. To circumvent the limitations present in current models, this paper introduces a novel hybrid network, Temporal Convolutional Network-Linear (TCN-Linear), which leverages the temporal prediction capabilities of the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to enhance the capacity of LSTF-Linear. Time series from three classical chaotic systems (Lorenz, Mackey–Glass, and Rossler) and real-world stock data serve as experimental datasets. Numerical simulation results indicate that, compared to classical networks and novel hybrid models, our model achieves the lowest RMSE, MAE, and MSE with the fewest training parameters, and its R2 value is the closest to 1.">

However, existing TKG approaches still face two main challenges, i.e., the limited capability to model arbitrary timestamps continuously and the lack of rich inference patterns under temporal constraints. In this paper, we propose an innovative TKGE method (PTBox) via polynomial decomposition-based temporal representation and box embedding-based entity representation to tackle the above-mentioned problems. Specifically, we decompose time information by polynomials and then enhance the model’s capability to represent arbitrary timestamps flexibly by incorporating the learnable temporal basis tensor. In addition, we model every entity as a hyperrectangle box and define each relation as a transformation on the head and tail entity boxes. The entity boxes can capture complex geometric structures and learn robust representations, improving the model’s inductive capability for rich inference patterns. Theoretically, our PTBox can encode arbitrary time information or even unseen timestamps while capturing rich inference patterns and higher-arity relations of the knowledge base. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.">

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments.

We generalize the diffusion equation with stochastic diffusivity at each time step, which aims to capture the multi-faceted information flows among interdependent data. Furthermore, we derive a new learning objective through causal inference, which can guide the model to learn generalizable patterns of interdependence that are insensitive across domains.

To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our rigorous benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738%), RMSE (4.8553%), MAE (3.9991%), and MAPE (20.1575%). Additionally, MCDFN's predictions were statistically indistinguishable from actual values, confirmed by a paired t-test with a 5% p-value and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability.

Existing learning techniques often rely on labels or clean versions of signals for detecting the periodicity, and those employing self-supervised learning methods are required to apply proper augmentations, which is already challenging for time series and can result in collapse -- all representations collapse to a single point due to strong augmentations. In this work, we propose a novel method to detect the periodicity in time series without the need for any labels or requiring tailored positive or negative data generation mechanisms with specific augmentations. We mitigate the collapse issue by ensuring the learned representations retain information from the original samples without imposing any random variance constraints on the batch.

        <tr id="While graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the de-facto standard for graph-based node classification, they impose a strong assumption on the availability of sufficient labeled samples. This assumption restricts the classification performance of prevailing GNNs on many real-world applications suffering from low-data regimes. Specifically, features extracted from scarce labeled nodes could not provide sufficient supervision for the unlabeled samples, leading to severe over-fitting. In this work, we point out that leveraging subgraphs to capture long-range dependencies can augment the representation of a node with homophily properties, thus alleviating the low-data regime. However, prior works leveraging subgraphs fail to capture the long-range dependencies among nodes. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised learning framework, called multi-view subgraph neural networks (Muse), for handling long-range dependencies. In particular, we propose an information theory-based identification mechanism to identify two types of subgraphs from the views of input space and latent space, respectively. The former is to capture the local structure of the graph, while the latter captures the long-range dependencies among nodes. By fusing these two views of subgraphs, the learned representations can preserve the topological properties of the graph at large, including the local structure and long-range dependencies, thus maximizing their expressiveness for downstream node classification tasks. Experimental results show that Muse outperforms the alternative methods on node classification tasks with limited labeled data.">

To address these challenges, we propose a novel MLP-based Adaptive Multi-Scale Decomposition (AMD) framework for TSF. Our framework decomposes time series into distinct temporal patterns at multiple scales, leveraging the Multi-Scale Decomposable Mixing (MDM) block to dissect and aggregate these patterns in a residual manner.

The accurate prediction of USV motion, particularly crucial parameters, such as the roll angle and pitch angle, is imperative for ensuring safe navigation. However, traditional and single prediction models often struggle with low accuracy and fail to capture the intricate spatial–temporal dependencies among multiple input variables. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a prediction approach integrating temporal convolutional network (TCN) and bi-directional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) models, augmented with a temporal pattern attention (TPA) mechanism, termed the TCN-Bi-LSTM-TPA (TBT) USV motion predictor. This hybrid model effectively combines the strengths of TCN and Bi-LSTM architectures to extract long-term temporal features and bi-directional dependencies. The introduction of the TPA mechanism enhances the model’s capability to extract spatial information, crucial for understanding the intricate interplay of various motion data. By integrating the features extracted by TCN with the output of the attention mechanism, the model incorporates additional contextual information, thereby improving prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conducted experiments using real USV motion data and calculated four evaluation metrics: mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R-squared (R2). The results demonstrate the superior accuracy of the TCN-Bi-LSTM-TPA hybrid model in predicting USV roll angle and pitch angle, validating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of multivariate USV motion prediction.">

        <tr id="Industrial process monitoring is a critical application of multivariate time-series (MTS) anomaly detection, especially crucial for safety-critical systems such as nuclear power plants (NPPs). However, some current data-driven process monitoring approaches may not fully capitalize on the temporal-spatial correlations inherent in operational MTS data. Particularly, asynchronous time-lagged correlations may exist among variables in actual NPPs, which further complicates this challenge. In this work, a reconstruction-based MTS anomaly detection approach based on a temporal-spatial transformer is proposed. It employs a two-stage temporal-spatial attention mechanism combined with a multi-scale strategy to learn the dependencies within normal operational data at various scales, thereby facilitating the extraction of temporal-spatial correlations from asynchronous MTS. Experiments on simulated datasets and real NPP datasets demonstrate that the proposed model possesses stronger feature learning capabilities, as evidenced by its improved performance in signal reconstruction and anomaly detection for asynchronous MTS data. Moreover, the proposed TS-Trans model enables earlier detection of anomalous events, which holds significant importance for enhancing operational safety and reducing potential losses in NPPs.">

However, existing models suffer from repetitive topic and unassociated topic issues, failing to reveal the evolution and hindering further applications. To address these issues, we break the tradition of simply chaining topics in existing work and propose a novel neural \modelfullname. We introduce a new evolution-tracking contrastive learning method that builds the similarity relations among dynamic topics. This not only tracks topic evolution but also maintains topic diversity, mitigating the repetitive topic issue. To avoid unassociated topics, we further present an unassociated word exclusion method that consistently excludes unassociated words from discovered topics. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, tracking topic evolution with high-quality topics, showing better performance on downstream tasks, and remaining robust to the hyperparameter for evolution intensities.

        <tr id="Anomaly detection in continuous-time dynamic graphs is an emerging field yet under-explored in the context of learning-based approaches. In this paper, we pioneer structured analyses of link-level anomalies and graph representation learning for identifying anomalous links in these graphs. First, we introduce a fine-grain taxonomy for edge-level anomalies leveraging structural, temporal, and contextual graph properties. We present a method for generating and injecting such typed anomalies into graphs. Next, we introduce a novel method to generate continuous-time dynamic graphs with consistent patterns across time, structure, and context. To allow temporal graph methods to learn the link anomaly detection task, we extend the generic link prediction setting by: (1) conditioning link existence on contextual edge attributes; and (2) refining the training regime to accommodate diverse perturbations in the negative edge sampler. Building on this, we benchmark methods for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets -- featuring synthetic and labeled organic anomalies and employing six state-of-the-art learning methods -- validate our taxonomy and generation processes for anomalies and benign graphs, as well as our approach to adapting link prediction methods for anomaly detection. Our results further reveal that different learning methods excel in capturing different aspects of graph normality and detecting different types of anomalies. We conclude with a comprehensive list of findings highlighting opportunities for future research.">

The accurate prediction of future values in a time series is vital for informed planning and resource allocation. The aim of this study is to explore whether the utilization of seasonal decomposition techniques, such as classical decomposition, X-12-ARIMA, and seasonal decomposition of time series (STL), can improve the effectiveness of time series forecasting models by separating the data into its distinct components, including trend and seasonality. We conduct a comprehensive analysis using real-world time series data, employing popular forecasting models like ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and machine learning-based approaches. By comparing the forecasting accuracy of these models with and without the application of seasonal decomposition techniques, we provide empirical evidence to support the hypothesis. Our research results provide valuable insights into the tangible ad- vantages of integrating seasonal decomposition techniques in time series forecasting, potentially contributing to enhanced decision support systems across diverse application domains.">

        <tr id="Default risk assessment for small companies is a tough problem in financial services. Recent efforts utilize advanced Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with metapaths to exploit interactive features in corporate activities for risk analysis. However, few works are proposed for commercial banks. Given a real financial graph, how to detect corporate default risks? We identify two challenges for the task. (1) Massive noisy connections hinder HGNNs to achieve strong results. (2) Multiple semantic connections greatly increase transitive default risk, while existing aggregation schemes do not leverage such connection patterns. In this work, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Co-Attention Network for corporate default risk assessment. Our model takes advantage of collaborative metapaths to distill risky features by a co-attentive aggregation mechanism. First, the local attention score models the importance of neighbors under each metapath by holistic metapath context. Second, the global attention score fuse local attention scores to filter valuable/noisy signals. Then, pairwise importance learning aims to enhance attention scores of multi-metapath neighbors for risky feature distillation. Extensive experiments on large-scale banking datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.">

While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is the more expressive model with better predictive performance, we will show that it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: it does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. Also, TACTiS does not provide any guarantees for marginalization consistency. We develop a novel probabilistic irregular time series forecasting model, Marginalization Consistent Mixtures of Separable Flows (moses), that mixes several normalizing flows with (i) Gaussian Processes with full covariance matrix as source distributions and (ii) a separable invertible transformation, aiming to combine the expressivity of normalizing flows with the marginalization consistency of Gaussians.

Compared with graph learning models, LLMs enjoy superior advantages in addressing the challenges of generalizing graph tasks by eliminating the need for training graph learning models and reducing the cost of manual annotation. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of existing LLM studies on graph data, which summarizes the relevant graph analytics tasks solved by advanced LLM models and points out the existing remaining challenges and future directions.

LLM-GQP focuses on an integration of graph analytics techniques and LLM prompts, including graph understanding and knowledge graph (KG) based augmented retrieval, while LLM-GIL focuses on learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning and graph representation. We summarize the useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks.

 Time series forecasting is a well-known deep learning application field in which previous data are used to predict the future behavior of the series. Recently, several deep learning approaches have been proposed in which several nonlinear functions are applied to the input to obtain the output. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to improve the performance of deep learning models in time series forecasting. This method divides the model into hierarchies or levels from simpler to more complex ones. Simpler levels handle smoothed versions of the input, whereas the most complex level processes the original time series. This method follows the human learning process where general/simpler tasks are performed first, and afterward, more precise/harder ones are accomplished. Our proposed methodology has been applied to the LSTM architecture, showing remarkable performance in various time series. In addition, a comparison is reported including a standard LSTM and novel methods such as DeepAR, Temporal Fusion Transformer, NBEATS and Echo State Network.">

Recent advancements in the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and attention mechanisms have markedly enhanced the accuracy of runoff forecasting models. This article introduces an innovative hybrid model, ResTCN-DAM, which synergizes the strengths of deep residual network (ResNet), temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), and dual attention mechanisms (DAMs). The proposed ResTCN-DAM is designed to leverage the unique attributes of these three modules: TCN has outstanding capability to process time series data in parallel. By combining with modified ResNet, multiple TCN layers can be densely stacked to capture more hidden information in the temporal dimension. DAM module adeptly captures the interdependencies within both temporal and feature dimensions, adeptly accentuating relevant time steps/features while diminishing less significant ones with minimal computational cost. Furthermore, the snapshot ensemble method is able to obtain the effect of training multiple models through one single training process, which ensures the accuracy and robustness of the forecasts. The deep integration and collaborative cooperation of these modules comprehensively enhance the model's forecasting capability from various perspectives. Ablation studies conducted validate the efficacy of each module, and through multiple sets of comparative experiments, it is shown that the proposed ResTCN-DAM has exceptional and consistent performance across varying lead times. We also employ visualization techniques to display heatmaps of the model's weights, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. When compared with the prevailing neural network-based runoff forecasting models, ResTCN-DAM exhibits state-of-the-art accuracy, temporal robustness, and interpretability, positioning it at the forefront of contemporary research.">

        <tr id="Link prediction is an important learning task for graph-structured data, and has become increasingly popular due to its wide application areas. Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches including Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) have achieved promising performance on link prediction outperforming conventional models which use hand-crafted features. VGAE learns latent node representations and predicts links based on the similarities between nodes. While the inner product based decoder effectively utilizes the node representations for link prediction, it exhibits sub-optimal performance due to the intrinsic limitation of the inner product. We found that the the cosine similarity and norm simultaneously try to explain the link probability, which hinders the gradient flow during training. We also point out the message passing scheme is unexpectedly dominated by the nodes with large norm values. In this paper, we propose a stochastic VGAE-based method that can effectively decouple the norm and angle in the embeddings. Specifically, we relate the cosine similarity and norm to two fundamental principles in graph: homophily and node popularity respectively. Our learning scheme is based on a hard expectation maximization learning method; we infer which of the two has been exerted for link formation, and subsequently optimize based on this guess. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on link prediction and achieves comparable performances on other downstream tasks such as node classification and clustering.

        <tr id="Recently, multiple models proposed for link prediction (LP) demonstrate impressive results on benchmark datasets. However, many popular benchmark datasets often assume that dataset samples are drawn from the same distribution (i.e., IID samples). In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; since uncontrolled factors may lead train and test samples to come from separate distributions. To tackle the distribution shift problem, recent work focuses on creating datasets that feature distribution shifts and designing generalization methods that perform well on the new data. However, those studies only consider distribution shifts that affect {\it node-} and {\it graph-level} tasks, thus ignoring link-level tasks. Furthermore, relatively few LP generalization methods exist. To bridge this gap, we introduce a set of LP-specific data splits which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift. We verify the shift's effect empirically through evaluation of different SOTA LP methods and subsequently couple these methods with generalization techniques. Interestingly, LP-specific methods frequently generalize poorly relative to heuristics or basic GNN methods. Finally, this work provides analysis to uncover insights for enhancing LP generalization.

We develop a novel convolutional graph neural network that integrates learnable DAG filters to account for the partial ordering induced by the graph topology, thus providing valuable inductive bias to learn effective representations of DAG-supported data. We discuss the salient advantages and potential limitations of the proposed DAG convolutional network (DCN) and evaluate its performance on two learning tasks using synthetic data: network diffusion estimation and source identification.

It operates mainly by imposing a data, learning or inductive bias with simulation data, Partial Differential Equations or equivariance and invariance properties.

To address this challenge, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach together with Graph Neural Network. We thus propose Neural Bond Graph Encoder (NBgE), a model agnostic physical-informed encoder tailored for multi-physics systems.

Existing models often overlook the temporal dimension in their training process, leading to suboptimal performance of those models over time, as they treat training data as a single homogeneous block. To address this, we introduce ChronosLex, an incremental training paradigm that trains models on chronological splits, preserving the temporal order of the data. However, this incremental approach raises concerns about overfitting to recent data, prompting an assessment of mitigation strategies using continual learning and temporal invariant methods. Our experimental results over six legal multi-label text classification datasets reveal that continual learning methods prove effective in preventing overfitting thereby enhancing temporal generalizability, while temporal invariant methods struggle to capture these dynamics of temporal shifts.">

        <tr id="Data assimilation is a vital component in modern global medium-range weather forecasting systems to obtain the best estimation of the atmospheric state by combining the short-term forecast and observations. Recently, AI-based data assimilation approaches have attracted increasing attention for their significant advantages over traditional techniques in terms of computational consumption. However, existing AI-based data assimilation methods can only handle observations with a specific resolution, lacking the compatibility and generalization ability to assimilate observations with other resolutions. Considering that complex real-world observations often have different resolutions, we propose the \textit{\textbf{Fourier Neural Processes}} (FNP) for \textit{arbitrary-resolution data assimilation} in this paper. Leveraging the efficiency of the designed modules and flexible structure of neural processes, FNP achieves state-of-the-art results in assimilating observations with varying resolutions, and also exhibits increasing advantages over the counterparts as the resolution and the amount of observations increase. Moreover, our FNP trained on a fixed resolution can directly handle the assimilation of observations with out-of-distribution resolutions and the observational information reconstruction task without additional fine-tuning, demonstrating its excellent generalization ability across data resolutions as well as across tasks.">

Analyzing these data can be challenging due to rare failure types, leading to imbalanced classes in multiclass classification.

This approach transforms the data into a graph using the GFT to address class imbalance, whereas the MPNN extracts features and models dependencies between network components. This combined approach identifies failure types in real and simulated NDT environments, demonstrating its potential for accurate failure classification in 5G and beyond (B5G) networks. Moreover, the MPNN is adept at learning complex local structures among neighbors in an end-to-end setting. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach can identify failure types in three multiclass domain datasets at multiple failure points in real networks and NDT environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed GFT-MPNN can accurately classify network failures in B5G networks, especially when employed within NDTs to detect failure types.">

However, classical GNNs face scalability challenges when dealing with large-scale graphs. This paper proposes frameworks for implementing GNNs on quantum computers to potentially address the challenges. We devise quantum algorithms corresponding to the three fundamental types of classical GNNs: Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks, and Message-Passing GNNs. A complexity analysis of our quantum implementation of the Simplified Graph Convolutional (SGC) Network shows potential quantum advantages over its classical counterpart, with significant improvements in time and space complexities. Our complexities can have trade-offs between the two: when optimizing for minimal circuit depth, our quantum SGC achieves logarithmic time complexity in the input sizes (albeit at the cost of linear space complexity). When optimizing for minimal qubit usage, the quantum SGC exhibits space complexity logarithmic in the input sizes, offering an exponential reduction compared to classical SGCs, while still maintaining better time complexity. These results suggest our Quantum GNN frameworks could efficiently process large-scale graphs. This work paves the way for implementing more advanced Graph Neural Network models on quantum computers, opening new possibilities in quantum machine learning for analyzing graph-structured data.">

        <tr id="Time-series analysis plays a pivotal role across a range of critical applications, from finance to healthcare, which involves various tasks, such as forecasting and classification. To handle the inherent complexities of time-series data, such as high dimensionality and noise, traditional supervised learning methods first annotate extensive labels for time-series data in each task, which is very costly and impractical in real-world applications. In contrast, pre-trained foundation models offer a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data to capture general time series patterns, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, existing approaches to pre-training such models typically suffer from high-bias and low-generality issues due to the use of predefined and rigid augmentation operations and domain-specific data training. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces UniCL, a universal and scalable contrastive learning framework designed for pretraining time-series foundation models across cross-domain datasets. Specifically, we propose a unified and trainable time-series augmentation operation to generate pattern-preserved, diverse, and low-bias time-series data by leveraging spectral information. Besides, we introduce a scalable augmentation algorithm capable of handling datasets with varying lengths, facilitating cross-domain pretraining. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across eleven domains validate the effectiveness of UniCL, demonstrating its high generalization on time-series analysis across various fields.">

Inspired by geographical analysis, the proposed CSA exploits the spatial relationships between channels of feature maps to produce an effective channel descriptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the f irst time that the concept of geographical spatial analysis is utilized in deep CNNs. The proposed CSA imposes negligible learning parameters and light computational overhead to the deep model, making it a powerful yet efficient attention module of choice. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed CSA networks (CSA-Nets) through extensive experiments and analysis on ImageNet, and MS COCO benchmark datasets for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.

        <tr id="The open-world test dataset is often mixed with out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, where the deployed models will struggle to make accurate predictions. Traditional detection methods need to trade off OOD detection and in-distribution (ID) classification performance since they share the same representation learning model. In this work, we propose to detect OOD molecules by adopting an auxiliary diffusion model-based framework, which compares similarities between input molecules and reconstructed graphs. Due to the generative bias towards reconstructing ID training samples, the similarity scores of OOD molecules will be much lower to facilitate detection. Although it is conceptually simple, extending this vanilla framework to practical detection applications is still limited by two significant challenges. First, the popular similarity metrics based on Euclidian distance fail to consider the complex graph structure. Second, the generative model involving iterative denoising steps is time-consuming especially when it runs on the enormous pool of drugs. To address these challenges, our research pioneers an approach of Prototypical Graph Reconstruction for Molecular OOD Detection, dubbed as PGR-MOOD and hinges on three innovations: i) An effective metric to comprehensively quantify the matching degree of input and reconstructed molecules; ii) A creative graph generator to construct prototypical graphs that are in line with ID but away from OOD; iii) An efficient and scalable OOD detector to compare the similarity between test samples and pre-constructed prototypical graphs and omit the generative process on every new molecule.

        <tr id="Modeling the dynamics of interacting entities using an evolving graph is an essential problem in fields such as financial networks and e-commerce. Traditional approaches focus primarily on pairwise interactions, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of real-world interactions involving multiple entities and their intricate relationship structures. This work addresses the problem of forecasting higher-order interaction events in multi-relational recursive hypergraphs. This is done using a dynamic graph representation learning framework that can capture complex relationships involving multiple entities. The proposed model, \textit{Relational Recursive Hyperedge Temporal Point Process} (RRHyperTPP) uses an encoder that learns a dynamic node representation based on the historical interaction patterns and then a hyperedge link prediction based decoder to model the event's occurrence. These learned representations are then used for downstream tasks involving forecasting the type and time of interactions. The main challenge in learning from hyperedge events is that the number of possible hyperedges grows exponentially with the number of nodes in the network. This will make the computation of negative log-likelihood of the temporal point process expensive, as the calculation of survival function requires a summation over all possible hyperedges. In our work, we use noise contrastive estimation to learn the parameters of our model, and we have experimentally shown that our models perform better than previous state-of-the-art methods for interaction forecasting.">

        <tr id="This study proposes a vessel position prediction method using attention spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks, which addresses the issue of low prediction accuracy due to less consideration of inter-feature dependencies in current vessel trajectory prediction methods. First, the method cleans the vessel trajectory data and uses the Time-ratio trajectory compression algorithm to compress the trajectory data, avoiding data redundancy and providing feature points for vessel trajectories. Second, the Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) extracts the correlation matrix that describes the relationship between multiple variables as a priori matrix input to the prediction model. Then the vessel trajectory prediction model is constructed, and the attention mechanism is added to the spatial and temporal dimensions of the trajectory data based on the spatio-temporal graph convolutional network at the same time as the above operations are performed on different time scales. Finally, the features extracted from different time scales are fused through the full connectivity layer to predict the future trajectories. Experimental results show that this method achieves higher accuracy and more stable prediction results in trajectory prediction. The attention-based spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks effectively capture the spatio-temporal correlations of the main features in vessel trajectories, and the spatio-temporal attention mechanism and graph convolution have certain interpretability for the prediction results.">

As the performance of the most capable models begin to saturate on tasks where humans already achieve high accuracy, it becomes necessary to benchmark models on increasingly complex abilities. One such task is forecasting the future outcome of events. In this work we describe experiments using a novel dataset of real world events and associated human predictions, an evaluation metric to measure forecasting ability, and the accuracy of a number of different LLM based forecasting designs on the provided dataset. Additionally, we analyze the performance of the LLM forecasters against human predictions and find that models still struggle to make accurate predictions about the future. Our follow-up experiments indicate this is likely due to models' tendency to guess that most events are unlikely to occur (which tends to be true for many prediction datasets, but does not reflect actual forecasting abilities). We reflect on next steps for developing a systematic and reliable approach to studying LLM forecasting.">

However, accurately portraying the performance of DLP algorithms poses challenges that might impede progress in the field. Importantly, common evaluation pipelines usually calculate ranking or binary classification metrics, where the scores of observed interactions (positives) are compared with those of randomly generated ones (negatives). However, a single metric is not sufficient to fully capture the differences between DLP algorithms, and is prone to overly optimistic performance evaluation. Instead, an in-depth evaluation should reflect performance variations across different nodes, edges, and time segments. In this work, we contribute tools to perform such a comprehensive evaluation. (1) We propose Birth–Death diagrams, a simple but powerful visualization technique that illustrates the effect of time-based train–test splitting on the difficulty of DLP on a given dataset. (2) We describe an exhaustive taxonomy of negative sampling methods that can be used at evaluation time. (3) We carry out an empirical study of the effect of the different negative sampling strategies. Our comparison between heuristics and state-of-the-art memory-based methods on various real-world datasets confirms a strong effect of using different negative sampling strategies on the test area under the curve (AUC). Moreover, we conduct a visual exploration of the prediction, with additional insights on which different types of errors are prominent over time.">

        <tr id="Large autoregressive models like Transformers can solve tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without learning new weights, suggesting avenues for efficiently solving new tasks. For many tasks, e.g., linear regression, the data factorizes: examples are independent given a task latent that generates the data, e.g., linear coefficients. While an optimal predictor leverages this factorization by inferring task latents, it is unclear if Transformers implicitly do so or if they instead exploit heuristics and statistical shortcuts enabled by attention layers. Both scenarios have inspired active ongoing work. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of explicitly inferring task latents. We minimally modify the Transformer architecture with a bottleneck designed to prevent shortcuts in favor of more structured solutions, and then compare performance against standard Transformers across various ICL tasks. Contrary to intuition and some recent works, we find little discernible difference between the two; biasing towards task-relevant latent variables does not lead to better out-of-distribution performance, in general. Curiously, we find that while the bottleneck effectively learns to extract latent task variables from context, downstream processing struggles to utilize them for robust prediction. Our study highlights the intrinsic limitations of Transformers in achieving structured ICL solutions that generalize, and shows that while inferring the right latents aids interpretability, it is not sufficient to alleviate this problem.">

        <tr id="Missing value imputation is a crucial preprocessing step for many machine learning problems. However, it is often considered as a separate subtask from downstream applications such as classification, regression, or clustering, and thus is not optimized together with them. We hypothesize that treating the imputation model and downstream task model together and optimizing over full pipelines will yield better results than treating them separately. Our work describes a novel AutoML technique for making downstream predictions with missing data that automatically handles preprocessing, model weighting, and selection during inference time, with minimal compute overhead. Specifically we develop M-DEW, a Dynamic missingness-aware Ensemble Weighting (DEW) approach, that constructs a set of two-stage imputation-prediction pipelines, trains each component separately, and dynamically calculates a set of pipeline weights for each sample during inference time. We thus extend previous work on dynamic ensemble weighting to handle missing data at the level of full imputation-prediction pipelines, improving performance and calibration on downstream machine learning tasks over standard model averaging techniques. M-DEW is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art in that it produces statistically significant reductions in model perplexity in 17 out of 18 experiments, while improving average precision in 13 out of 18 experiments.">

        <tr id="In recent years, analyzing the explanation for the prediction of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has attracted increasing attention. Despite this progress, most existing methods do not adequately consider the inherent uncertainties stemming from the randomness of model parameters and graph data, which may lead to overconfidence and misguiding explanations. However, it is challenging for most of GNN explanation methods to quantify these uncertainties since they obtain the prediction explanation in a post-hoc and model-agnostic manner without considering the randomness of graph data and model parameters. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a novel uncertainty quantification framework for GNN explanations. For mitigating the randomness of graph data in the explanation, our framework accounts for two distinct data uncertainties, allowing for a direct assessment of the uncertainty in GNN explanations. For mitigating the randomness of learned model parameters, our method learns the parameter distribution directly from the data, obviating the need for assumptions about specific distributions. Moreover, the explanation uncertainty within model parameters is also quantified based on the learned parameter distributions. This holistic approach can integrate with any post-hoc GNN explanation methods. Empirical results from our study show that our proposed method sets a new standard for GNN explanation performance across diverse real-world graph benchmarks.">

Although the THP has gained increasing studies, it still suffers from the {sequence prediction issue}, i.e., training on history sequences and inferencing about the future, which is a prevalent paradigm in realistic sequence analysis tasks. What's more, conventional THP and its variants simply adopt initial sinusoid embedding in transformers, which shows performance sensitivity to temporal change or noise in sequence data analysis by our empirical study.

This study proposes a novel TSF model designed to address the challenges posed by real-life data, delivering accurate forecasts in both multivariate and univariate settings. First, we propose methods termed “weak-stationarizing” and “non-stationarity restoring” to mitigate distributional shift. These methods enable the removal and restoration of non-stationary components from individual data points as needed. Second, we utilize the spectral decomposition of weak-stationary time series to extract informative features for forecasting. To learn features from the spectral decomposition of weak-stationary time series, we exploit a mixer architecture to find inter- and intra-series dependencies from the unraveled representation of the overall time series.

This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go. NKDCD also utilizes sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights of the lag matrices, encouraging the model to select only the needed causal dependencies within the data. Through extensive testing on practically applicable datasets, it is shown that the NKDCD outperforms the existing nonlinear Granger causality discovery approaches.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks are becoming increasingly popular in the field of machine learning due to their unique ability to process data structured in graphs. They have also been applied in safety-critical environments where perturbations inherently occur. However, these perturbations require us to formally verify neural networks before their deployment in safety-critical environments as neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks. While there exists research on the formal verification of neural networks, there is no work verifying the robustness of generic graph convolutional network architectures with uncertainty in the node features and in the graph structure over multiple message-passing steps. This work addresses this research gap by explicitly preserving the non-convex dependencies of all elements in the underlying computations through reachability analysis with (matrix) polynomial zonotopes. We demonstrate our approach on three popular benchmark datasets.">

For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique, which are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs. However, existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DyGPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and dynamic variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DyGPrompt through extensive experiments on three public datasets.">

However, the black-box nature of those models makes the results difficult to interpret by users. This study aims to leverage an Explainable AI approach, counterfactual explanations, to enhance the explainability and usability of deep learning-based traffic forecasting models. Specifically, the goal is to elucidate relationships between various input contextual features and their corresponding predictions. We present a comprehensive framework that generates counterfactual explanations for traffic forecasting and provides usable insights through the proposed scenario-driven counterfactual explanations. The study first implements a deep learning model to predict traffic speed based on historical traffic data and contextual variables. Counterfactual explanations are then used to illuminate how alterations in these input variables affect predicted outcomes, thereby enhancing the transparency of the deep learning model. We investigated the impact of contextual features on traffic speed prediction under varying spatial and temporal conditions. The scenario-driven counterfactual explanations integrate two types of user-defined constraints, directional and weighting constraints, to tailor the search for counterfactual explanations to specific use cases. These tailored explanations benefit machine learning practitioners who aim to understand the model's learning mechanisms and domain experts who seek insights for real-world applications. The results showcase the effectiveness of counterfactual explanations in revealing traffic patterns learned by deep learning models, showing its potential for interpreting black-box deep learning models used for spatiotemporal predictions in general.">

        <tr id="An essential component of autonomous transportation system management and decision-making is precise and real-time traffic flow forecast. Predicting future traffic conditionsis a difficult undertaking because of the intricate spatio-temporal relationships involved. Existing techniques often employ separate modules to model spatio-temporal features independently, thereby neglecting the temporally and spatially heterogeneous features among nodes. Simultaneously, many existing methods overlook the long-term relationships included in traffic data, subsequently impacting prediction accuracy. We introduce a novel method to traffic flow forecasting based on the combination of the feature-augmented down-sampling dynamic graph convolutional network and multi-head attention mechanism. Our method presents a feature augmentation mechanism to integrate traffic data features at different scales. The subsampled convolutional network enhances information interaction in spatio-temporal data, and the dynamic graph convolutional network utilizes the generated graph structure to better simulate the dynamic relationships between nodes, enhancing the model’s capacity for capturing spatial heterogeneity. Through the feature-enhanced subsampled dynamic graph convolutional network, the model can simultaneously capture spatio-temporal dependencies, and coupled with the process of multi-head temporal attention, it achieves long-term traffic flow forecasting. The findings demonstrate that the ADDGCN model demonstrates superior prediction capabilities on two real datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08). Notably, for the PEMS04 dataset, compared to the best baseline, the performance of ADDGCN is improved by 2.46% in MAE and 2.90% in RMSE; for the PEMS08 dataset, compared to the best baseline, the ADDGCN performance is improved by 1.50% in RMSE, 3.46% in MAE, and 0.21% in MAPE, indicating our method’s superior performance.">

These methods often struggle to generalize and automate complex tasks in networking, as they require extensive labeled data, domain-specific feature engineering, and frequent retraining to adapt to new scenarios. However, the recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a new wave of possibilities in addressing these challenges. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning. These models, trained on extensive data, can benefit the networking domain. Some efforts have already explored the application of LLMs in the networking domain and revealed promising results.

We introduce the highlights of existing works by category and explain in detail how they operate at different stages of the workflow.

When ML methods are responsible for making critical decisions, stakeholders often require insights into how to alter these decisions. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) have emerged as a solution, offering interpretations of opaque ML models and providing a pathway to transition from one decision to another. However, most existing CFE methods require access to the model's training dataset, few methods can handle multivariate time-series, and none can handle multivariate time-series without training datasets. These limitations can be formidable in many scenarios. In this paper, we present CFWoT, a novel reinforcement-learning-based CFE method that generates CFEs when training datasets are unavailable. CFWoT is model-agnostic and suitable for both static and multivariate time-series datasets with continuous and discrete features. Users have the flexibility to specify non-actionable, immutable, and preferred features, as well as causal constraints which CFWoT guarantees will be respected. We demonstrate the performance of CFWoT against four baselines on several datasets and find that, despite not having access to a training dataset, CFWoT finds CFEs that make significantly fewer and significantly smaller changes to the input time-series. These properties make CFEs more actionable, as the magnitude of change required to alter an outcome is vastly reduced.">

Accurately predicting patient care demand, however, is a ubiquitous challenge for hospitals across the world due, in part, to the demand's time-varying temporal variability, and, in part, to the difficulty in modelling trends in advance. To address this issue, here, we develop two methods, a relatively simple time-vary linear model, and a more advanced neural network model. The former forecasts patient arrivals hourly over a week based on factors such as day of the week and previous 7-day arrival patterns. The latter leverages a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, capturing non-linear relationships between past data and a three-day forecasting window. We evaluate the predictive capabilities of the two proposed approaches compared to two na\"ive approaches - a reduced-rank vector autoregressive (VAR) model and the TBATS model. Using patient care demand data from Rambam Medical Center in Israel, our results show that both proposed models effectively capture hourly variations of patient demand. Additionally, the linear model is more explainable thanks to its simple architecture, whereas, by accurately modelling weekly seasonal trends, the LSTM model delivers lower prediction errors. Taken together, our explorations suggest the utility of machine learning in predicting time-varying patient care demand; additionally, it is possible to predict patient care demand with good accuracy (around 4 patients) three days or a week in advance using machine learning.">

The core innovation is identifying similar samples via instance normalization statistics and clustering into groups which provides consistent class-irrelevant representations. Specifically, Our DYN consists of layer-wise instance statistics clustering (LISC) and cluster-aware batch normalization (CABN). In LISC, we perform layer-wise clustering of approximate feature samples at each BN layer by calculating the cosine similarity of instance normalization statistics across the batch. CABN then aggregates SBN and TCN statistics to collaboratively characterize the target distribution, enabling more robust representations. Experimental results validate DYN's robustness and effectiveness, demonstrating maintained performance under dynamic data stream patterns.">

Traditional models focusing on internet traffic (INT) analysis often fail to capture the rich temporal and spatial contexts essential for accurate INT predictions.

This study proposes a multi-source CNN-RNN (MSCR) model that leverages a rich dataset, including periodic, weather, news, and social data to address these limitations. This model enables the capture and fusion of diverse data sources for improved INT prediction accuracy. An advanced deep learning model, the transformer-enhanced CNN-RNN (TE-CNN-RNN), has been introduced. This model is specifically designed to predict INT data only. This model demonstrates the effectiveness of transformers in extracting detailed temporal-spatial features, outperforming conventional CNN-RNN models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSCR and TE-CNN-RNN models outperform existing state-of-the-art models for traffic forecasting. These findings underscore the transformative power of transformers for capturing intricate temporal-spatial features and the importance of multi-source data and deep learning techniques for optimizing cell site management in the B5G era.">

        <tr id="In the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), ensuring reliable travel time predictions is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of transportation management systems and supporting long-term planning. Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated the ability to effectively leverage large datasets for accurate travel time predictions. These innovations are particularly vital as they address both short-term and long-term travel demands, which are essential for effective traffic management and scheduled routing planning. Despite advances in deep learning applications for traffic analysis, the dynamic nature of traffic patterns frequently challenges the forecasting capabilities of existing models, especially when forecasting both immediate and future traffic conditions across various time horizons. Additionally, the area of long-term travel time forecasting still remains not fully explored in current research due to these complexities. In response to these challenges, this study introduces the Periodic Transformer Encoder (PTE). PTE is a Transformer-based model designed to enhance traffic time predictions by effectively capturing temporal dependencies across various horizons. Utilizing attention mechanisms, PTE learns from long-range periodic traffic data for handling both short-term and long-term fluctuations. Furthermore, PTE employs a streamlined encoder-only architecture that eliminates the need for a traditional decoder, thus significantly simplifying the model’s structure and reducing its computational demands. This architecture enhances both the training efficiency and the performance of direct travel time predictions. With these enhancements, PTE effectively tackles the challenges presented by dynamic traffic patterns, significantly improving prediction performance across multiple time horizons. Comprehensive evaluations on an extensive real-world traffic dataset demonstrate PTE’s superior performance in predicting travel times over multiple horizons compared to existing methods. PTE is notably effective in adapting to high-variability road segments and peak traffic hours. These results prove PTE’s effectiveness and robustness across diverse traffic environments, indicating its significant contribution to advancing traffic prediction capabilities within ITS.">

Signal analysis, data statistical learning, and conventional deep learning techniques face constraints under these conditions due to their substantial data requirements and the necessity for transfer learning to accommodate new failure modes. To effectively leverage information and extract the intrinsic characteristics of faults across different domains under limited sample conditions, this paper introduces a fault diagnosis approach employing Multi-Scale Graph Convolution Filtering (MSGCF). MSGCF enhances the traditional Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework by integrating both local and global information fusion modules within the graph convolution filter block. This advancement effectively mitigates the over-smoothing issue associated with excessive layering of graph convolutional layers while preserving a broad receptive field. It also reduces the risk of overfitting in few-shot diagnosis, thereby augmenting the model's representational capacity. Experiments on the University of Paderborn bearing dataset (PU) demonstrate that the MSGCF method proposed herein surpasses alternative approaches in accuracy, thereby offering valuable insights for industrial fault diagnosis in few-shot learning scenarios.">

The novelty compared to classical neural network architecture is that it explicitly incorporates time warping ability, as well as a new way of considering attention. In addition, this architecture is capable of learning a dropout strategy, thus optimizing its own architecture.Behind the design of this architecture, our overall objective is threefold: firstly, we are aiming at improving the accuracy of instance based classification approaches that shows quite good performances as far as enough training data is available. Secondly we seek to reduce the computational complexity inherent to these methods to improve their scalability. Ideally, we seek to find an acceptable balance between these first two criteria. And finally, we seek to enhance the explainability of the decision provided by this kind of neural architecture.The experiment demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent implemented to train a teNN is quite effective. To the extent that the selection of some critical meta-parameters is correct, convergence is generally smooth and fast.While maintaining good accuracy, we get a drastic gain in scalability by first reducing the required number of reference time series, i.e. the number of teNN cells required. Secondly, we demonstrate that, during the training process, the teNN succeeds in reducing the number of neurons required within each cell. Finally, we show that the analysis of the activation and attention matrices as well as the reference time series after training provides relevant information to interpret and explain the classification results.The comparative study that we have carried out and which concerns around thirty diverse and multivariate datasets shows that the teNN obtains results comparable to those of the state of the art, in particular similar to those of a network mixing LSTM and CNN architectures for example.">

On the other hand, the perspective of multi-source information fusion effectively improves the accuracy of forecasting. Due to the fact that BPA is generated by fuzzy theory, TEFN also has considerable interpretability. In real data experiments, the TEFN partially achieved state-of-the-art, with low errors comparable to PatchTST, and operating efficiency surpass performance models such as Dlinear. Meanwhile, TEFN has high robustness and small error fluctuations in the random hyperparameter selection.

In this paper, we propose a method that combines advanced machine learning with rigorous time series analysis to improve prediction accuracy by integrating different datasets, providing a prescriptive example for passenger flow prediction in urban rail transit systems. The study employs advanced machine learning algorithms and proposes a novel prediction model that combines two-stage decomposition (seasonal and trend decomposition using LOESS–ensemble empirical mode decomposition (STL-EEMD)) and gated recurrent units. First, the STL decomposition algorithm is applied to break down the preprocessed data into trend terms, periodic terms, and irregular fluctuation terms. Then, the EEMD decomposition algorithm is employed to further decompose the irregular fluctuation terms, yielding multiple IMF components and residual residuals. Subsequently, the decomposed data from STL and EEMD are partitioned into training and test sets and normalized. The training set is utilized to train the model for optimal performance in predicting subway short-time passenger flow. The synthesis of these sophisticated methodologies serves to substantially enhance both the predictive precision and the broad applicability of the forecasting models. The efficacy of the proposed approach is rigorously evaluated through its application to empirical metro passenger flow datasets from diverse urban centers, demonstrating marked superiority in predictive performance over traditional forecasting methods. The insights gleaned from this study bear significant ramifications for the strategic planning and administration of public transportation infrastructures, potentially leading to more strategic resource allocation and an enhanced commuter experience.">

However, DPMs have an arbitrary noisy latent space with no interpretable or controllable semantics. Although there has been significant research effort to improve image sample quality, there is little work on representation-controlled generation using diffusion models. Specifically, causal modeling and controllable counterfactual generation using DPMs is an underexplored area. In this work, we propose CausalDiffAE, a diffusion-based causal representation learning framework to enable counterfactual generation according to a specified causal model. Our key idea is to use an encoder to extract high-level semantically meaningful causal variables from high-dimensional data and model stochastic variation using reverse diffusion. We propose a causal encoding mechanism that maps high-dimensional data to causally related latent factors and parameterize the causal mechanisms among latent factors using neural networks. To enforce the disentanglement of causal variables, we formulate a variational objective and leverage auxiliary label information in a prior to regularize the latent space. We propose a DDIM-based counterfactual generation procedure subject to do-interventions. Finally, to address the limited label supervision scenario, we also study the application of CausalDiffAE when a part of the training data is unlabeled, which also enables granular control over the strength of interventions in generating counterfactuals during inference. We empirically show that CausalDiffAE learns a disentangled latent space and is capable of generating high-quality counterfactual images.">

Our key findings are: i) Time steps can be empirically divided into acceleration, deceleration, and convergence areas based on the process increment. ii) These time steps are imbalanced, with many concentrated in the convergence area. iii) The concentrated steps provide limited benefits for diffusion training. To address this, we design an asymmetric sampling strategy that reduces the frequency of steps from the convergence area while increasing the sampling probability for steps from other areas. Additionally, we propose a weighting strategy to emphasize the importance of time steps with rapid-change process increments. As a plug-and-play and architecture-agnostic approach, SpeeD consistently achieves 3-times acceleration across various diffusion architectures, datasets, and tasks. Notably, due to its simple design, our approach significantly reduces the cost of diffusion model training with minimal overhead. Our research enables more researchers to train diffusion models at a lower cost.">

Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.">

The forecast uncertainty, particularly for precipitation, serves as a crucial indicator of the reliability of deterministic forecasts. Traditionally, forecast uncertainty is estimated by ensemble forecasting, which is computationally expensive since the forecast model is run multiple times with perturbations. Recently, deep learning methods have been explored to learn the statistical properties of ensemble prediction systems due to their low computational costs. However, accurately and effectively capturing the uncertainty information in precipitation forecasts remains challenging. In this study, we present a novel spatiotemporal transformer network (ST-TransNet) as an alternative approach to estimate uncertainty with ensemble spread and probabilistic forecasts, by learning from historical ensemble forecasts. ST-TransNet features a hierarchical structure for extracting multiscale features and incorporates a spatiotemporal transformer module with window-based attention to capture correlations in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, window-based attention can not only extract local precipitation patterns but also reduce computational costs. The proposed ST-TransNet is evaluated on the TIGGE ensemble forecast dataset and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation products. Results show that ST-TransNet outperforms both traditional and deep learning methods across various metrics. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to generate reasonable and accurate spread and probability forecasts from a single deterministic precipitation forecast. It demonstrates the capacity and efficiency of neural networks in estimating precipitation forecast uncertainty.">

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.">

        <tr id="Time series analysis is an essential field in data analysis, particularly within forecasting and prediction domains. Researching and building time series models play a crucial role in understanding and predicting the temporal dynamics of various phenomena. In mathematics, time series data is defined as data points indexed in chronological order and have a consistent time interval between consecutive observations. This can include data such as daily stock prices, annual national income, quarterly company revenue, and more. The advantage of time series data is that it can capture the state of a variable over time. In contrast, the world is constantly changing, and phenomena rarely remain static they typically exhibit variations over time. Therefore, time series data has highly practical applications and is used in various fields, including statistics, econometrics, financial mathematics, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, electroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy, telecommunications, and signal processing. ARIMA, which stands for Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average, is a widely used time series forecasting method in data science. It is a popular model for analyzing and predicting time-dependent data points. ARIMA combines autoregression, differencing, and moving averages to capture different aspects of time series data. In this paper, we study ARIMA, which is a significant model for analyzing and predicting time series data.">

        <tr id="Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) addresses the challenge of training predictive models under temporally varying data distributions. Traditional TDG approaches typically focus on domain data collected at fixed, discrete time intervals, which limits their capability to capture the inherent dynamics within continuous-evolving and irregularly-observed temporal domains. To overcome this, this work formalizes the concept of Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), where domain data are derived from continuous times and are collected at arbitrary times. CTDG tackles critical challenges including: 1) Characterizing the continuous dynamics of both data and models, 2) Learning complex high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and 3) Optimizing and controlling the generalization across continuous temporal domains. To address them, we propose a Koopman operator-driven continuous temporal domain generalization (Koodos) framework. We formulate the problem within a continuous dynamic system and leverage the Koopman theory to learn the underlying dynamics; the framework is further enhanced with a comprehensive optimization strategy equipped with analysis and control driven by prior knowledge of the dynamics patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.">

        <tr id="Time series is a typical data type in numerous domains; however, labeling large amounts of time series data can be costly and time-consuming. Learning effective representation from unlabeled time series data is a challenging task. Contrastive learning stands out as a promising method to acquire representations of unlabeled time series data. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised time-series representation learning framework via Time-Frequency Fusion Contrasting (TF-FC) to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. Specifically, TF-FC combines time-domain augmentation with frequency-domain augmentation to generate the diverse samples. For time-domain augmentation, the raw time series data pass through the time-domain augmentation bank (such as jitter, scaling, permutation, and masking) and get time-domain augmentation data. For frequency-domain augmentation, first, the raw time series undergoes conversion into frequency domain data following Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. Then, the frequency data passes through the frequency-domain augmentation bank (such as low pass filter, remove frequency, add frequency, and phase shift) and gets frequency-domain augmentation data. The fusion method of time-domain augmentation data and frequency-domain augmentation data is kernel PCA, which is useful for extracting nonlinear features in high-dimensional spaces. By capturing both the time and frequency domains of the time series, the proposed approach is able to extract more informative features from the data, enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish between different time series. To verify the effectiveness of the TF-FC method, we conducted experiments on four time series domain datasets (i.e., SleepEEG, HAR, Gesture, and Epilepsy). Experimental results show that TF-FC significantly improves in recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.">

To address these challenges, a correntropy-based two-dimensional long short-term memory (TLSTM) model is developed to handle noisy process data. First, the multidimensional time series samples are reconstructed into numerous two-dimensional input matrices in the feature and time directions. Then, the convolution and pooling operations are used to extract useful information in the process variables related to the quality variable. Meanwhile, a gating mechanism is employed to learn the internal representation of time series.

Crucially, the model includes (one or more) graph changepoints, which are learned jointly with all model parameters and incorporate graph dynamics.

        <tr id="Abstract. Current multi-epoch InSAR techniques heavily rely on the assumption of linear deformation. This can sometimes overlook crucial deformation signals when using velocities for evaluation. The process of interpreting InSAR time series is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also requires a certain level of expertise. This study refines existing InSAR deformation categories, such as stable, linear, step, piecewise linear, power, and undefined, to define 'canonical deformation time series patterns.' We propose an innovative approach for InSAR post-processing using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and transfer learning. Due to the limited availability of real data, we use simulated data to train a pre-existing model. We then assess the effectiveness of our method in identifying urban deformation patterns. This research could significantly improve our understanding of large-scale InSAR time series deformation and reveal the underlying patterns.

        <tr id="Transformer-based long context generative models power emerging AI applications like hour-long video understanding and project-level coding agent. Deploying long context transformers (e.g., 100K to 10M tokens) is prohibitively expensive compared to short context (e.g., 4K tokens) model variants. Reducing the cost of long-context transformers is becoming a pressing research and engineering challenge starting from the year of 2024. This work describes a concurrent programming framework for quantitatively analyzing the efficiency challenges in serving multiple long-context requests under limited size of GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) regime. We give a detailed analysis of how all additional computational costs, compared to 4K context, trace back to \textit{one single source: the large size of the KV cache}. We use a 34B GPT-3.5 level model of 50K context on A100 NVLink as a running example, and describe how its large KV cache causes four types of deployment challenges: (1) prefilling long inputs takes much longer compute time and GPU memory than short inputs; (2) after prefilling, the large KV cache residing on the GPU HBM substantially restricts the number of concurrent users being served; (3) during decoding, repeatedly reading the KV cache from HBM to SM largely increases latency; (4) when KV cache memory overflows, swapping it from HBM to DDR causes significant context switching latency. We use this framework to analyze existing works and identify possibilities of combining them to build end-to-end systems. Overall, this work offers a foundational framework for analyzing long context transformer deployment and identifies directions towards reducing the inference cost of 1M context to be as cheap as 4K.">

Moreover, the performance of these models on in-distribution data is a poor indicator of their performance on data from unseen domains. Thus, it is essential to develop metrics that can provide insights into the model's performance at test time and can be computed only with the information available at test time (such as their model parameters, the training data or its statistics, and the unlabeled test data). To this end, we propose a metric based on Optimal Transport that is highly correlated with the model's performance on unseen domains and is efficiently computable only using information available at test time. Concretely, our metric characterizes the model's performance on unseen domains using only a small amount of unlabeled data from these domains and data or statistics from the training (source) domain(s). Through extensive empirical evaluation using standard benchmark datasets, and their corruptions, we demonstrate the utility of our metric in estimating the model's performance in various practical applications. These include the problems of selecting the source data and architecture that leads to the best performance on data from an unseen domain and the problem of predicting a deployed model's performance at test time on unseen domains. Our empirical results show that our metric, which uses information from both the source and the unseen domain, is highly correlated with the model's performance, achieving a significantly better correlation than that obtained via the popular prediction entropy-based metric, which is computed solely using the data from the unseen domain.">

Applying semi-supervised learning to time series data presents unique challenges due to its inherent temporal complexities. Efficient contrastive learning for time series requires specialized methods, particularly in the development of tailored data augmentation techniques.

Moreover, our framework presents a novel data augmentation method, which selectively augments only the trend component of the data, effectively preserving their inherent periodic properties and facilitating effective training. For training, we introduce a novel contrastive loss that utilizes the nearest neighbors of augmented data for positive and negative representations.

In our study, we enhance conventional convolutional neural network models, specifically those based on the embedded temporal convolutional network framework, thus transforming them into models that inherently understand and interpret multidimensional correlations and dependencies. This transformation involves recasting the existing problem as a generalized case of N-dimensional observation analysis, which is followed by deriving essential forward and backward pass equations through tensor decompositions and compounded convolutions. Consequently, we adapt integral components of established embedded temporal convolutional network models, like encoder and decoder networks, thus enabling them to process 4D spatial time series data that encompass all essential climate variables concurrently. Through the rigorous exploration of diverse model architectures and an extensive evaluation of their forecasting prowess against top-tier methods, we utilize two new, long-term essential climate variables datasets with monthly intervals extending over four decades.

        <tr id="In this paper, we aim to both borrow information from existing units and incorporate the target unit's history data in time series forecasting. We consider a situation when we have time series data from multiple units that share similar patterns when aligned in terms of an internal time. The internal time is defined as an index according to evolving features of interest. When mapped back to the calendar time, these time series can span different time intervals that can include the future calendar time of the targeted unit, over which we can borrow the information from other units in forecasting the targeted unit. We first build a hierarchical state space model for the multiple time series data in terms of the internal time, where the shared components capture the similarities among different units while allowing for unit‐specific deviations. A conditional state space model is then constructed to incorporate the information of existing units as the prior information in forecasting the targeted unit. By running the Kalman filtering based on the conditional state space model on the targeted unit, we incorporate both the information from the other units and the history of the targeted unit. The forecasts are then transformed from internal time back into calendar time for ease of interpretation. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance. Forecasting state‐level new COVID‐19 cases in United States is used for illustration.">

We present the Label-Prior Graph Attention (LPGA) model, which significantly enhances the performance of news-driven stock price movement forecasting. This model is comprised of a unique graph attention architecture, incorporating a label encoder and a text encoder, designed to effectively capture and utilize the relationships between labels in a graph-based context. Our model demonstrates superior performance over several benchmark models. The LPGA model's efficacy is further validated through experiments on two multi-label datasets.

        <tr id="Multi-relational networks among entities are frequently observed in the era of big data. Quantifying the effects of multiple networks have attracted significant research interest recently. In this work, we model multiple network effects through an autoregressive framework for tensor-valued time series. To characterize the potential heterogeneity of the networks and handle the high dimensionality of the time series data simultaneously, we assume a separate group structure for entities in each network and estimate all group memberships in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we propose a group tensor network autoregression (GTNAR) model, which assumes that within each network, entities in the same group share the same set of model parameters, and the parameters differ across networks. An iterative algorithm is developed to estimate the model parameters and the latent group memberships simultaneously. Theoretically, we show that the group-wise parameters and group memberships can be consistently estimated when the group numbers are correctly- or possibly over-specified. An information criterion for group number estimation of each network is also provided to consistently select the group numbers. Lastly, we implement the method on a Yelp dataset to illustrate the usefulness of the method.">

        <tr id="Predicting how social networks change in the future is important in many applications. Results in social network research have shown that the change in the network can be explained by a small number of concepts, such as "homophily" and "transitivity". However, existing prediction methods require many latent features that are not connected to such concepts, making the methods' black boxes and their prediction results difficult to interpret, making them harder to derive scientific knowledge about social networks. In this study, we propose NetEvolve a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based method that predicts changes in a given social network. Given a sequence of changes as training data, NetEvolve learns the characteristics of the nodes with interpretable features, such as how the node feels rewards for connecting with similar people and the cost of the connection itself. Based on the learned feature, NetEvolve makes a forecast based on multi-agent simulation. The method achieves comparable or better accuracy than existing methods in predicting network changes in real-world social networks while keeping the prediction results interpretable.">

        <tr id="Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular het-erogeneity in complex biological systems. However, analyzing and integrating scRNA-seq data poses unique computational challenges due to sparsity, high variability, and technical batch effects. Here, we propose a novel framework called scDecorr for robust representation learning and data integration for scRNA-seq analysis. Our approach leverages the idea of feature decorrelation-based self-supervised learning (SSL) to obtain efficient low-dimensional representations of individual cells without relying on negative samples. By maximizing similarity among distorted embeddings while decorrelating their components, scDecorr captures the biological signature while eliminating technical noise. Furthermore, scDecorr incorporates unsupervised domain adaptation to bridge the gap between batches with different probability distributions, enabling effective integration of scRNA-seq data from diverse sources. Our framework achieves domain-invariant representations by learning cell embeddings independently across domains and employing domain-specific batch normalization. We evaluate scDecorr on a variety of single cell datasets and demonstrate its ability to integrate batches without losing the inherent biological variance, thereby facilitating optimal clustering. The representations generated by scDecorr also exhibit robustness in label transfer tasks, allowing for effective transfer of cell-type labels from reference to query datasets. Overall, scDecorr offers a powerful tool for efficient analysis and integration of large and complex scRNA-seq datasets, advancing our understanding of cellular processes and disease mechanisms.

        <tr id="Recently, memory consumption of Deep Neural Network (DNN) rapidly increases, mainly due to long lifetimes and large shapes of tensors. Graph scheduling has emerged as an effective memory optimization technique, which determines the optimal execution, re-computation, swap-out, and swap-in timings for each operator/tensor. However, it often hurts performance significantly and can only manipulate tensors' lifetimes but not shapes, limiting the optimization space. We find that graph transformation, which can change the tensor shapes and graph structure, creates a new trade-off space between memory and performance. Nevertheless, graph transformation are applied separately so far, with primary focus on optimizing performance and not memory. In this paper, we propose MAGIS, a DNN memory optimization framework that coordinates graph transformation with graph scheduling. MAGIS uses a hierarchical tree to represent Fission Transformation (F-Trans), a type of transformation which can effectively reduce tensor shapes in a sub-graph. To keep the complexity low, we build a light-weight search space based on graph structure analysis. MAGIS decomposes graph scheduling into graph transformation and re-ordering and designs an incremental scheduling algorithm to alleviate the scheduling overhead after each graph transformation step to efficiently coordinate them. Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art works, MAGIS only uses 15%~85% of their peak memory usage with the same latency1 constraint and obtains a better Pareto boundary in dual-objective optimization of memory and performance. Our code is now available at https://github.com/pku-liang/MAGIS.">

        <tr id="Effectively learning from sequential data is a longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the case of long sequences. From the dawn of Machine Learning, several researchers engaged in the search of algorithms and architectures capable of processing sequences of patterns, retaining information about the past inputs while still leveraging the upcoming data, without losing precious long-term dependencies and correlations. While such an ultimate goal is inspired by the human hallmark of continuous real-time processing of sensory information, several solutions simplified the learning paradigm by artificially limiting the processed context or dealing with sequences of limited length, given in advance. These solutions were further emphasized by the large ubiquity of Transformers, that have initially shaded the role of Recurrent Neural Nets. However, recurrent networks are facing a strong recent revival due to the growing popularity of (deep) State-Space models and novel instances of large-context Transformers, which are both based on recurrent computations to go beyond several limits of currently ubiquitous technologies. In fact, the fast development of Large Language Models enhanced the interest in efficient solutions to process data over time. This survey provides an in-depth summary of the latest approaches that are based on recurrent models for sequential data processing. A complete taxonomy over the latest trends in architectural and algorithmic solutions is reported and discussed, guiding researchers in this appealing research field. The emerging picture suggests that there is room for thinking of novel routes, constituted by learning algorithms which depart from the standard Backpropagation Through Time, towards a more realistic scenario where patterns are effectively processed online, leveraging local-forward computations, opening to further research on this topic.">

        <tr id="Subgraph representation learning is a technique for analyzing local structures (or shapes) within complex networks. Enabled by recent developments in scalable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this approach encodes relational information at a subgroup level (multiple connected nodes) rather than at a node level of abstraction. We posit that certain domain applications, such as anti-money laundering (AML), are inherently subgraph problems and mainstream graph techniques have been operating at a suboptimal level of abstraction. This is due in part to the scarcity of annotated datasets of real-world size and complexity, as well as the lack of software tools for managing subgraph GNN workflows at scale. To enable work in fundamental algorithms as well as domain applications in AML and beyond, we introduce Elliptic2, a large graph dataset containing 122K labeled subgraphs of Bitcoin clusters within a background graph consisting of 49M node clusters and 196M edge transactions. The dataset provides subgraphs known to be linked to illicit activity for learning the set of"shapes"that money laundering exhibits in cryptocurrency and accurately classifying new criminal activity. Along with the dataset we share our graph techniques, software tooling, promising early experimental results, and new domain insights already gleaned from this approach. Taken together, we find immediate practical value in this approach and the potential for a new standard in anti-money laundering and forensic analytics in cryptocurrencies and other financial networks.">

        <tr id="Background: Open Source Software is the building block of modern software. However, the prevalence of project deprecation in the open source world weakens the integrity of the downstream systems and the broad ecosystem. Therefore it calls for efforts in monitoring and predicting project deprecations, empowering stakeholders to take proactive measures. Challenge: Existing techniques mainly focus on static features on a point in time to make predictions, resulting in limited effects. Goal: We propose a novel metric from the user-repository network, and leverage the metric to fit project deprecation predictors and prove its real-life implications. Method: We establish a comprehensive dataset containing 103,354 non-fork GitHub OSS projects spanning from 2011 to 2023. We propose repository centrality, a family of HITS weights that captures shifts in the popularity of a repository in the repository-user star network. Further with the metric, we utilize the advancements in gradient boosting and deep learning to fit survival analysis models to predict project lifespan or its survival hazard. Results: Our study reveals a correlation between the HITS centrality metrics and the repository deprecation risk. A drop in the HITS weights of a repository indicates a decline in its centrality and prevalence, leading to an increase in its deprecation risk and a decrease in its expected lifespan. Our predictive models powered by repository centrality and other repository features achieve satisfactory accuracy on the test set, with repository centrality being the most significant feature among all. Implications: This research offers a novel perspective on understanding the effect of prevalence on the deprecation of OSS repositories. Our approach to predict repository deprecation help detect health status of project and take actions in advance, fostering a more resilient OSS ecosystem.">

TS3IM evaluates multiple dimensions of similarity-trend, variability, and structural integrity-offering a more nuanced and comprehensive measure. This metric represents a significant leap forward, providing a robust tool for analyzing temporal data and offering more accurate and comprehensive sequence analysis and decision support in fields such as monitoring power consumption, analyzing traffic flow, and adversarial recognition. Our extensive experimental results also show that compared with traditional methods that rely heavily on computational correlation, TS3IM is 1.87 times more similar to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in evaluation results and improves by more than 50% in adversarial recognition.">

        <tr id="For industrial processes, it is significant to carry out the dynamic modeling of data series for quality prediction. However, there are often different sampling rates between the input and output sequences. For the most traditional data series models, they have to carefully select the labeled sample sequence to build the dynamic prediction model, while the massive unlabeled input sequences between labeled samples are directly discarded. Moreover, the interactions of the variables and samples are usually not fully considered for quality prediction at each labeled step. To handle these problems, a hierarchical self-attention network (HSAN) is designed for adaptive dynamic modeling. In HSAN, a dynamic data augmentation is first designed for each labeled step to include the unlabeled input sequences. Then, a self-attention layer of variable level is proposed to learn the variable interactions and short-interval temporal dependencies. After that, a self-attention layer of sample level is further developed to model the long-interval temporal dependencies. Finally, a long short-term memory network (LSTM) network is constructed to model the new sequence that contains abundant interactions for quality prediction. The experiment on an industrial hydrocracking process shows the effectiveness of HSAN.">
