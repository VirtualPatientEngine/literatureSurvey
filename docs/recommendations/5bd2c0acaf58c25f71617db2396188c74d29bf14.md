        <tr id="Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant attention. However, challenges such as data scarcity and data imbalance continue to hinder their development. To address this, we consider modeling complex systems through symbolic expressions that serve as semantic descriptors of time series. Building on this concept, we introduce a series-symbol (S2) dual-modulity data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic representations. Leveraging the S2 dataset, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for TSA. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tuned with downstream task, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of dual-modality data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.">

        <tr id="Exploring and comparing non-stationary multivariate time series is an important problem in many domains and real-world applications. In recent work, we introduced dsymb, a symbolic representation that transforms multivariate time series into interpretable symbolic sequences that comes along with a compatible and efficient distance measure to compare the obtained symbolic sequences. We have shown how dsymb can handle the non-stationarity of multivariate physiological signals, how interpretable the symbolization is, and how suitable the distance measure is compared to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) variants. We have also empirically shown that the computation time when using dsymb on a clustering time is significantly smaller than with DTW variants (typically 100 times faster). In this demonstration, we present the dsymb playground, an interactive web-based tool to interpret and compare a large multivariate time series dataset quickly. We showcase the relevance of this tool in several scenarios based on real-world datasets.">

        <tr id="Human Activity Recognition (HAR) involves complex, multi-output datasets that demand models balancing efficiency, scalability, and interpretability. This paper proposes a Scalable Fuzzy Neural Network (SFNN), an adaptive hierarchical deep architecture with a multi-section learning mechanism. SFNN processes smaller input windows with effective dimensionality reduction, achieving competitive performance without the heavy computational cost of traditional deep models. Leveraging the transparency of fuzzy systems, it offers a more interpretable alternative to black-box approaches. The model’s theoretical convergence guarantees and strong results on the Opportunity dataset confirm its effectiveness for diverse HAR tasks.">

        <tr id="Decorative mats plaited by the Iban communities in Borneo contains motifs that reflect their traditional beliefs. Each motif has its own special meaning and taboos. A typical mat motif contains multiple smaller patterns that surround the main motif hence is likely to cause misclassification. We introduce a classification framework with adaptive sampling to remove smaller features whilst retaining larger (and discriminative) image structures. Canny filter and probabilistic hough transform are gradually applied to a clean greyscale image until a threshold value pertaining to the image’s structural information is reached. Morphological dilation is then applied to improve the appearance of the retained edges. The resulting image is described using binary robust invariant scalable keypoints (BRISK) features with random sample consensus (RANSAC). We reported the classification accuracy against six common image deformations at incremental degrees: scale+rotation, viewpoint, image blur, joint photographic experts group (JPEG) compression, scale and illumination. From our sensitivity analysis, we found the optimal threshold for adaptive smoothing to be 75.0%. The optimal scheme obtained 100.0% accuracy for JPEG compression, illumination, and viewpoint set. Using adaptive smoothing, we achieved an average increase in accuracy of 11.0% compared to the baseline.">
