        <tr id="We propose a probabilistic model discovery method for identifying ordinary differential equations governing the dynamics of observed multivariate data. Our method is based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) framework, where models are expressed as sparse linear combinations of pre-specified candidate functions. Promoting parsimony through sparsity leads to interpretable models that generalize to unknown data. Instead of targeting point estimates of the SINDy coefficients, we estimate these coefficients via sparse Bayesian inference. The resulting method, uncertainty quantification SINDy (UQ-SINDy), quantifies not only the uncertainty in the values of the SINDy coefficients due to observation errors and limited data, but also the probability of inclusion of each candidate function in the linear combination. UQ-SINDy promotes robustness against observation noise and limited data, interpretability (in terms of model selection and inclusion probabilities) and generalization capacity for out-of-sample forecast. Sparse inference for UQ-SINDy employs Markov chain Monte Carlo, and we explore two sparsifying priors: the spike and slab prior, and the regularized horseshoe prior. UQ-SINDy is shown to discover accurate models in the presence of noise and with orders-of-magnitude less data than current model discovery methods, thus providing a transformative method for real-world applications which have limited data.">

        <tr id="Sparse model identification enables nonlinear dynamical system discovery from data. However, the control of false discoveries for sparse model identification is challenging, especially in the low-data and high-noise limit. In this paper, we perform a theoretical study on ensemble sparse model discovery, which shows empirical success in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise. In particular, we analyse the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares estimator. We show that this bootstrapping-based ensembling technique can perform a provably correct variable selection procedure with an exponential convergence rate of the error rate. In addition, we show that the ensemble sparse model discovery method can perform computationally efficient uncertainty estimation, compared to expensive Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods via MCMC. We demonstrate the convergence properties and connection to uncertainty quantification in various numerical studies on synthetic sparse linear regression and sparse model discovery. The experiments on sparse linear regression support that the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares method has better performance for sparse variable selection compared to LASSO, thresholding least-squares, and bootstrapping-based LASSO. In the sparse model discovery experiment, we show that the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares method can provide valid uncertainty quantification, converging to a delta measure centered around the true value with increased sample sizes. Finally, we highlight the improved robustness to hyperparameter selection under shifting noise and sparsity levels of the bootstrapping-based sequential thresholding least-squares method compared to other sparse regression methods.">

        <tr id="Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.">

        <tr id="We propose a fast probabilistic framework for identifying differential equations governing the dynamics of observed data. We recast the SINDy method within a Bayesian framework and use Gaussian approximations for the prior and likelihood to speed up computation. The resulting method, Bayesian-SINDy, not only quantifies uncertainty in the parameters estimated but also is more robust when learning the correct model from limited and noisy data. Using both synthetic and real-life examples such as Lynx-Hare population dynamics, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the new framework in learning correct model equations and compare its computational and data efficiency with existing methods. Because Bayesian-SINDy can quickly assimilate data and is robust against noise, it is particularly suitable for biological data and real-time system identification in control. Its probabilistic framework also enables the calculation of information entropy, laying the foundation for an active learning strategy.">

        <tr id="Significance Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.">

We then show SINDy can be further augmented to perform robustly when both kinds of uncertainty are present.">

        <tr id="We consider the data-driven discovery of governing equations from time-series data in the limit of high noise. The algorithms developed describe an extensive toolkit of methods for circumventing the deleterious effects of noise in the context of the <italic>sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics</italic> (SINDy) framework. We offer two primary contributions, both focused on noisy data acquired from a system <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\dot { \boldsymbol x} = { \boldsymbol f} ({ \boldsymbol x})$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. First, we propose, for use in high-noise settings, an extensive toolkit of critically enabling extensions for the SINDy regression method, to progressively cull functionals from an over-complete library and yield a set of sparse equations that regress to the derivate <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\dot { \boldsymbol {x}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. This toolkit includes: (regression step) weight timepoints based on estimated noise, use ensembles to estimate coefficients, and regress using FFTs; (culling step) leverage linear dependence of functionals, and restore and protect culled functionals based on Figures of Merit (FoMs). In a novel Assessment step, we define FoMs that compare model predictions to the original time-series (i.e., <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${ \boldsymbol x}(t)$ </tex-math></inline-formula> rather than <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\dot { \boldsymbol {x}}(t)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). These innovations can extract sparse governing equations and coefficients from high-noise time-series data (e.g., 300% added noise). For example, it discovers the correct sparse libraries in the Lorenz system, with median coefficient estimate errors equal to 1%âˆ’3% (for 50% noise), 6%âˆ’8% (for 100% noise), and 23%âˆ’25% (for 300% noise). The enabling modules in the toolkit are combined into a single method, but the individual modules can be tactically applied in other equation discovery methods (SINDy or not) to improve results on high-noise data. Second, we propose a technique, applicable to any model discovery method based on <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\dot { \boldsymbol x} = { \boldsymbol f} ({ \boldsymbol x})$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, to assess the accuracy of a discovered model in the context of non-unique solutions due to noisy data. Currently, this non-uniqueness can obscure a discovered modelâ€™s accuracy and thus a discovery methodâ€™s effectiveness. We describe a technique that uses linear dependencies among functionals to transform a discovered model into an equivalent form that is closest to the <italic>true</italic> model, enabling more accurate assessment of a discovered modelâ€™s correctness.">
