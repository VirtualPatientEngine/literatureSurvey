In this two part treatise, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct classes of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information. In this first part, we demonstrate how these networks can be used to infer solutions to partial differential equations, and obtain physics-informed surrogate models that are fully differentiable with respect to all input coordinates and free parameters.">

In this second part of our two-part treatise, we focus on the problem of data-driven discovery of partial differential equations.

The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using a wide range of benchmark problems in mathematical physics, including conservation laws, incompressible fluid flow, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.">

        <tr id="The process of transforming observed data into predictive mathematical models of the physical world has always been paramount in science and engineering. Although data is currently being collected at an ever-increasing pace, devising meaningful models out of such observations in an automated fashion still remains an open problem. In this work, we put forth a machine learning approach for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Specifically, we blend classical tools from numerical analysis, namely the multi-step time-stepping schemes, with powerful nonlinear function approximators, namely deep neural networks, to distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems involving the identification of complex, nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and we demonstrate how this allows us to accurately learn the dynamics, forecast future states, and identify basins of attraction. In particular, we study the Lorenz system, the fluid flow behind a cylinder, the Hopf bifurcation, and the Glycoltic oscillator model as an example of complicated nonlinear dynamics typical of biological systems.">

        <tr id="Mathematical models of biological reactions at the system-level lead to a set of ordinary differential equations with many unknown parameters that need to be inferred using relatively few experimental measurements. Having a reliable and robust algorithm for parameter inference and prediction of the hidden dynamics has been one of the core subjects in systems biology, and is the focus of this study. We have developed a new systems-biology-informed deep learning algorithm that incorporates the system of ordinary differential equations into the neural networks. Enforcing these equations effectively adds constraints to the optimization procedure that manifests itself as an imposed structure on the observational data. Using few scattered and noisy measurements, we are able to infer the dynamics of unobserved species, external forcing, and the unknown model parameters. We have successfully tested the algorithm for three different benchmark problems. Author summary The dynamics of systems biological processes are usually modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which introduce various unknown parameters that need to be estimated efficiently from noisy measurements of concentration for a few species only. In this work, we present a new “systems-informed neural network” to infer the dynamics of experimentally unobserved species as well as the unknown parameters in the system of equations. By incorporating the system of ODEs into the neural networks, we effectively add constraints to the optimization algorithm, which makes the method robust to noisy and sparse measurements.">

        <tr id="We propose a randomized physics-informed neural network (PINN) or rPINN method for uncertainty quantification in inverse partial differential equation (PDE) problems with noisy data. This method is used to quantify uncertainty in the inverse PDE PINN solutions. Recently, the Bayesian PINN (BPINN) method was proposed, where the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters was formulated using the Bayes' theorem and sampled using approximate inference methods such as the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference (VI) methods. In this work, we demonstrate that HMC fails to converge for non-linear inverse PDE problems. As an alternative to HMC, we sample the distribution by solving the stochastic optimization problem obtained by randomizing the PINN loss function. The effectiveness of the rPINN method is tested for linear and non-linear Poisson equations, and the diffusion equation with a high-dimensional space-dependent diffusion coefficient. The rPINN method provides informative distributions for all considered problems. For the linear Poisson equation, HMC and rPINN produce similar distributions, but rPINN is on average 27 times faster than HMC. For the non-linear Poison and diffusion equations, the HMC method fails to converge because a single HMC chain cannot sample multiple modes of the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters in a reasonable amount of time.">

The current advection-dispersion-reaction equation is one of the key formulas used to depict natural processes with distinct characteristics. It is composed of a first-order advection component, a third-order dispersion term, and a nonlinear response term. Using the deep neural network approach and accounting for physics-informed neural network awareness, the problem has been elaborately discussed. Initial and boundary conditions are added as constraints when the neural networks are trained by minimizing the loss function.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a significant advancement in scientific machine learning by integrating fundamental physical laws into their architecture through loss functions. PINNs have been successfully applied to solve various forward and inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, a notable challenge can emerge during the early training stages when solving inverse problems. Specifically, data losses remain high while PDE residual losses are minimized rapidly, thereby exacerbating the imbalance between loss terms and impeding the overall efficiency of PINNs. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel framework termed data-guided physics-informed neural networks (DG-PINNs). The DG-PINNs framework is structured into two distinct phases: a pre-training phase and a fine-tuning phase. In the pre-training phase, a loss function with only the data loss is minimized in a neural network. In the fine-tuning phase, a composite loss function, which consists of the data loss, PDE residual loss, and, if available, initial and boundary condition losses, is minimized in the same neural network. Notably, the pre-training phase ensures that the data loss is already at a low value before the fine-tuning phase commences. This approach enables the fine-tuning phase to converge to a minimal composite loss function with fewer iterations compared to existing PINNs. To validate the effectiveness, noise-robustness, and efficiency of DG-PINNs, extensive numerical investigations are conducted on inverse problems related to several classical PDEs, including the heat equation, wave equation, Euler--Bernoulli beam equation, and Navier--Stokes equation. The numerical results demonstrate that DG-PINNs can accurately solve these inverse problems and exhibit robustness against noise in training data.">

        <tr id="Deep learning with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has emerged as a highly popular and effective approach for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this paper, we first investigate the extrapolation capability of the PINN method for time-dependent PDEs. Taking advantage of this extrapolation property, we can generalize the training result obtained in the time subinterval to the large interval by adding a correction term to the network parameters of the subinterval. The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.">

In particular, we compare them with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks (DeepONets), which are based on the standard MLP representation. We find that although the original KANs based on the B-splines parameterization lack accuracy and efficiency, modified versions based on low-order orthogonal polynomials have comparable performance to PINNs and DeepONet although they still lack robustness as they may diverge for different random seeds or higher order orthogonal polynomials. We visualize their corresponding loss landscapes and analyze their learning dynamics using information bottleneck theory. Our study follows the FAIR principles so that other researchers can use our benchmarks to further advance this emerging topic.">

However, despite their significant success in various fields, it remains unclear in many aspects how to effectively train PINNs if the solutions of PDEs exhibit stiff behaviors or high frequencies. In this paper, we propose a new method for training PINNs using variable-scaling techniques. This method is simple and it can be applied to a wide range of problems including PDEs with rapidly-varying solutions. Throughout various numerical experiments, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for these problems and confirm that it can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of PINNs. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we will provide theoretical evidence for this phenomenon and show that our methods can indeed improve the performance of PINNs.">

Physics-informed neural networks are an optimization based approach for solving differential equations that is completely meshless. This substantially simplifies the modeling of the inundation process of tsunamis. While physics-informed neural networks require retraining for each particular new initial condition of the shallow-water equations, we also introduce the use of deep operator networks that can be trained to learn the solution operator instead of a particular solution only and thus provides substantial speed-ups, also compared to classical numerical approaches for tsunami models. We show with several classical benchmarks that our method can model both tsunami propagation and the inundation process exceptionally well.">

        <tr id="Wildland fires pose terrifying natural hazards, underscoring the urgent need to develop data-driven and physics-informed digital twins for wildfire prevention, monitoring, intervention, and response. In this direction of research, this work introduces a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) to learn the unknown parameters of an interpretable wildfire spreading model. The considered wildfire spreading model integrates fundamental physical laws articulated by key model parameters, essential for capturing the complex behavior of wildfires. The proposed machine learning approach leverages the theory of artificial neural networks with the physical constraints governing wildfire dynamics, such as the first principles of mass and energy conservation. Training of the PiNN for physics-informed parameter identification is realized using data of the temporal evolution of one- and two-dimensional (plane surface) fire fronts that have been obtained from a high-fidelity simulator of the wildfire spreading model under consideration. The parameter learning results demonstrate the remarkable predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in uncovering the unknown coefficients in both the one- and two-dimensional fire spreading scenarios. Additionally, this methodology exhibits robustness by identifying the same parameters in the presence of noisy data. The proposed framework is envisioned to be incorporated in a physics-informed digital twin for intelligent wildfire management and risk assessment.">

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

        <tr id="Structural damage detection is an inverse problem to identify and quantify structural damage from measurement data by discovering the variation of structural mechanical parameters. Recently, a novel deep learning framework named physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed and successfully applied to solve inverse problems of various linear/nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical information such as governing equations as prior information. In this study, we propose a PINN-based framework to exploit a novel method of structural damage detection. Specifically, a deep neural network model as the core of PINNs is built to predict the dynamic response in different degrees of freedom. The unknown mechanical parameters are initialized randomly and updated together with the neural network model parameters. Then, the structural physics model is embedded by calculating the residuals of governing equations as parts of the loss function. The residual between the predicted dynamic response and measurement data is also used as another part of the loss function. A two-step optimization strategy is proposed to obtain the best unknown parameter values that can fit the measurement data and governing equations simultaneously. Through numerical experiments of a single-degree-of-freedom system, we demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify potential structural mechanical parameters and quantitatively detect structural damage. The influence of sparsity and noise in the measurement data on the detection results is also analysed.">

        <tr id="Physics informed neural networks have been gaining popularity due to their unique ability to incorporate physics laws into data-driven models, ensuring that the predictions are not only consistent with empirical data but also align with domain-specific knowledge in the form of physics equations. The integration of physics principles enables the method to require less data while maintaining the robustness of deep learning in modeling complex dynamical systems. However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Preliminary results indicate that physics-informed machine learning holds significant potential for advancing the study of ecological systems.">

This work applies KANs as the backbone of a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation framework, generalizing their use to the time-dependent and grid-sensitive cases often seen in scientific machine learning applications. The proposed KAN-ODEs retain the flexible dynamical system modeling framework of Neural ODEs while leveraging the many benefits of KANs, including faster neural scaling, stronger interpretability, and lower parameter counts when compared against MLPs. We demonstrate these benefits in three test cases: the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, Burgers' equation, and the Fisher-KPP PDE. We showcase the strong performance of parameter-lean KAN-ODE systems generally in reconstructing entire dynamical systems, and also in targeted applications to the inference of a source term in an otherwise known flow field. We additionally demonstrate the interpretability of KAN-ODEs via activation function visualization and symbolic regression of trained results. The successful training of KAN-ODEs and their improved performance when compared to traditional Neural ODEs implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications.">

This paper proposes an adaptive inverse PINN applied to different transport models, from diffusion to advection-diffusion-reaction problems. Once a suitable PINN is established to solve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable parameters. We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly. Several examples are presented for different test cases to support our PINN architecture and its scalability and robustness.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed deep learning has been developed as a novel paradigm for learning physical dynamics recently. While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Parameter estimation is one of the central problems in computational modeling of biological systems. Typically, scientists must fully specify the mathematical structure of the model, often expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations, to estimate the parameters. This process poses significant challenges due to the necessity for a detailed understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating model parameters and assessing their identifiability in situations where only partial knowledge of the system structure is available. The partially known model is extended into a system of Hybrid Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, which captures the unknown portions of the system using neural networks. Integrating neural networks into the model structure introduces two primary challenges for parameter estimation: the need to globally explore the search space while employing gradient-based optimization, and the assessment of parameter identifiability, which may be hindered by the expressive nature of neural networks. To overcome the first issue, we treat biological parameters as hyperparameters in the extended model, exploring the parameter search space during hyperparameter tuning. The second issue is then addressed by an a posteriori analysis of parameter identifiability, computed by introducing a variant of a well-established approach for mechanistic models. These two components are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that is thoroughly described in the paper. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on test cases derived from three different benchmark models. These test cases have been designed to mimic real-world conditions, including the presence of noise in the training data and various levels of data availability for the system variables. Author summary Parameter estimation is a central challenge in modeling biological systems. Typically, scientists calibrate the parameters by aligning model predictions with measured data once the model structure is defined. Our paper introduces a workflow that leverages the integration between mechanistic modeling and machine learning to estimate model parameters when the model structure is not fully known. We focus mainly on analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters, which measures how confident we can be in the parameter estimates given the available experimental data and partial mechanistic understanding of the system. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach in various in silico scenarios. Our workflow represents a first step to adapting traditional methods used in fully mechanistic models to the scenario of hybrid modeling.">

Motivated from the ﬁnite volume schemes, the cell-average based neural network method is constructed based on the ﬁnite volume integrals of the original PDEs. Supervised training is designed to learn the solution average difference between two neighboring time steps. The training data set is generated by the cell average based on a single initial value of the given PDE. The training process employs multiple time levels of cell averages to maintain stability and control temporal accumulation errors. After being well trained based on appropriate meshes, this method can be utilized like a regular explicit ﬁnite volume method to evolve the solution under large time steps. Furthermore, it can be applied to solve different type of initial value problems without retraining the neural network. In order to validate the capability and robustness of the CANN method, we also utilize it to deal with the corrupted learning data which is generated from the Gaussian white noise. Several numerical examples of different types of Hunter-Saxton equations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, capability, and robustness of the proposed method.

The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries.

The impact of physics-informed neural networks helps to approximate elliptic partial differential equations governed by the physical process. The proposed technique employs learning the behaviour of complex systems based on input-output data, and automatic differentiation ensures accurate computation of gradient. The method computes the singularity-embedded local fractional partial derivative model on a Hausdorff metric, which otherwise halts the computation by available approximating numerical methods. This is possible because the new network is capable of updating the weight associated with loss terms depending on the solution domain and requirement of solution behaviour. The semi-positive definite character of the neural tangent kernel achieves the convergence of gradient-based adaptive neural networks. The importance of hyperparameters, namely the number of neurons and the learning rate, is shown by considering a stationary anomalous diffusion-convection model on a rectangular domain.

We analyze the convergence properties and establish the error bounds of this method for two types of PDEs: parabolic (exemplified by the heat and Burgers' equations) and hyperbolic (exemplified by the wave and nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations). We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation. Ample numerical experiments are presented based on the proposed algorithm to validate the effectiveness of this method and confirm aspects of the theoretical analyses.">

        <tr id="The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

Among the available approaches, Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) are used to combine prior knowledge in the form of mechanistic formulations with universal function approximators, like neural networks. Integral to the efficacy of UDEs is the joint estimation of parameters within mechanistic formulations and the universal function approximators using empirical data. The robustness and applicability of resultant models, however, hinge upon the rigorous quantification of uncertainties associated with these parameters, as well as the predictive capabilities of the overall model or its constituent components. With this work, we provide a formalisation of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for UDEs and investigate important frequentist and Bayesian methods.

        <tr id="Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, more data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalizable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than the neural network alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularization, penalizing biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularization not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularization reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses. Author summary Systems biology concerns the modelling and analysis of biological processes, by viewing these as interconnected systems. Modelling is typically done either using mechanistic differential equations that are derived from experiments and known biology, or using machine learning on large biological datasets. While mathematical modelling from biological experiments can provide useful insights with limited data, building and validating these models takes a long time and often requires highly invasive measurements in humans. Efforts to combine this classical technique with machine learning have resulted in a framework termed universal differential equations, where the model equations contain a neural network to describe unknown biological interactions. While these methods have shown success in numerous fields, applications in biology are more challenging due to limited data-availability, high data sparsity. In this work, we have introduced physiology-informed regularization to overcome these instabilities and to constrain the model to biologically plausible behavior. Our results show that by using physiology-informed regularization, we can accurately predict future unseen observations in a simulated example, with much more limited data than a similar model without regularization. Additionally, we show an application of this technique on human data, applying a neural network to learn the appearance of glucose in the blood plasma after a meal.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of deep operator networks (DeepONets) in solving both forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) on unknown manifolds. By unknown manifolds, we identify the manifold by a set of randomly sampled data point clouds that are assumed to lie on or close to the manifold. When the loss function incorporates the physics, resulting in the so-called physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), we approximate the differentiation terms in the PDE by an appropriate operator approximation scheme. For the second-order elliptic PDE with a nontrivial diffusion coefficient, we approximate the differentiation term with one of these methods: the Diffusion Maps (DM), the Radial Basis Functions (RBF), and the Generalized Moving Least Squares (GMLS) methods. For the GMLS approximation, which is more flexible for problems with boundary conditions, we derive the theoretical error bound induced by the approximate differentiation. Numerically, we found that DeepONet is accurate for various types of diffusion coefficients, including linear, exponential, piecewise linear, and quadratic functions, for linear and semi-linear PDEs with/without boundaries. When the number of observations is small, PI-DeepONet trained with sufficiently large samples of PDE constraints produces more accurate approximations than DeepONet. For the inverse problem, we incorporate PI-DeepONet in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to estimate the diffusion coefficient from noisy solutions of the PDEs measured at a finite number of point cloud data. Numerically, we found that PI-DeepONet provides accurate approximations comparable to those obtained by a more expensive method that directly solves the PDE on the proposed diffusion coefficient in each MCMC iteration.">

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

        <tr id="Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.">

We propose an easy-to-apply heuristic to assess whether estimation of such states may be possible. As numerical examples, we consider a continuously stirred tank reactor and a liquid-liquid separator. We find that PINNs can infer unmeasured states with reasonable accuracy, and they generalize better in low-data scenarios than purely data-driven models. We thus show that PINNs are capable of modeling processes when relatively few experimental data and only partially known mechanistic descriptions are available, and conclude that they constitute a promising avenue that warrants further investigation.">

        <tr id="Given the existence of various forward and inverse problems in combustion studies and applications that necessitate distinct methods for resolution, a framework to solve them in a unified way is critically needed. A promising approach is the integration of machine learning methods with governing equations of combustion systems, which exhibits superior generality and few-shot learning ability compared to purely data-driven methods. In this work, the FlamePINN-1D framework is proposed to solve the forward and inverse problems of 1D laminar flames based on physics-informed neural networks. Three cases with increasing complexity have been tested: Case 1 are freely-propagating premixed (FPP) flames with simplified physical models, while Case 2 and Case 3 are FPP and counterflow premixed (CFP) flames with detailed models, respectively. For forward problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to solve the flame fields and infer the unknown eigenvalues (such as laminar flame speeds) under the constraints of governing equations and boundary conditions. For inverse problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to reconstruct the continuous fields and infer the unknown parameters (such as transport and chemical kinetics parameters) from noisy sparse observations of the flame. Our results strongly validate these capabilities of FlamePINN-1D across various flames and working conditions. Compared to traditional methods, FlamePINN-1D is differentiable and mesh-free, exhibits no discretization errors, and is easier to implement for inverse problems. The inverse problem results also indicate the possibility of optimizing chemical mechanisms from measurements of laboratory 1D flames. Furthermore, some proposed strategies, such as hard constraints and thin-layer normalization, are proven to be essential for the robust learning of FlamePINN-1D.

Our framework showcases four algorithms, each embedding a specific physics-based prior tailored to a particular class of nonlinear systems, including separable and nonseparable Hamiltonian systems, hyperbolic partial differential equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics. The intrinsic incorporation of physical laws preserves the system's intrinsic symmetries and conservation laws, ensuring solutions are physically plausible and computationally efficient. The integration of these priors also enhances the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns typical in physical phenomena that conventional methods often miss.

However, solving inverse problems involving fractional derivatives presents notable challenges, including issues related to stability and uniqueness. While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as effective tools for solving inverse problems, most existing PINN frameworks primarily focus on integer-ordered derivatives. In this study, we extend the application of PINNs to address inverse problems involving time-fractional derivatives, specifically targeting two problems: 1) anomalous diffusion and 2) fractional viscoelastic constitutive equation. Leveraging both numerically generated datasets and experimental data, we calibrate the concentration-dependent generalized diffusion coefficient and parameters for the fractional Maxwell model. We devise a tailored residual loss function that scales with the standard deviation of observed data. We rigorously test our framework's efficacy in handling anomalous diffusion. Even after introducing 25% Gaussian noise to the concentration dataset, our framework demonstrates remarkable robustness. Notably, the relative error in predicting the generalized diffusion coefficient and the order of the fractional derivative is less than 10% for all cases, underscoring the resilience and accuracy of our approach. In another test case, we predict relaxation moduli for three pig tissue samples, consistently achieving relative errors below 10%. Furthermore, our framework exhibits promise in modeling anomalous diffusion and non-linear fractional viscoelasticity.">

Unlike other approaches, e.g., Fully-connected Neural Network (FCNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based methods that are used to model the system states directly, the proposed approach embraces a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) paradigm that models the derivatives of the system states. A central part of the proposed methodology is its capacity to learn the multibody system dynamics from prior physical knowledge and constraints combined with data inputs.

Their main benefit is better accuracy with fewer training points compared to standard neural networks. These attributes are particularly desirable in the field of computer-aided design, where there is often the need to replace computationally expensive, physics-based models with fast running approximations, known as surrogate models or meta-models. Since a surrogate emulates the original model accurately in near-real time, it yields a speed benefit that can be used to carry out orders of magnitude more function calls quickly. However, in the special case of gradient-enhanced methods, there is the additional value proposition that partial derivatives are accurate, which is a critical property for one important use-case: surrogate-based optimization. This work derives the complete theory and exemplifies its superiority over standard neural nets for surrogate-based optimization.">

Despite demonstrating potential across diverse applications, PINNs have encountered challenges in accurately predicting solutions for time-dependent problems. In response, this study presents a novel methodology aimed at enhancing the predictive capability of PINNs for time-dependent scenarios. Our approach involves dividing the temporal domain into multiple subdomains and employing an adaptive weighting strategy at the initial condition and at the interfaces between these subdomains. By employing such interfacial conditioning in physics informed neural networks (IcPINN), we have solved several unsteady PDEs (e.g., Allen–Cahn equation, advection equation, Korteweg–De Vries equation, Cahn–Hilliard equation, and Navier–Stokes equations) and conducted a comparative analysis with numerical results.

We address limitations of previous work on data-driven flow map learning in the sense that we focus on noisy and limited data to move toward data collection scenarios in real-world applications. Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning. This primarily allows for smaller training data sets, but also enables reduced training times.">

The prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them suitable surrogates for providing design insights. However, only a few NNs can efficiently handle complex engineering scenario predictions.

Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. RBFs offer good approximation properties and are typically computationally fast. The KAN architecture, combined with RBFs, allows DeepOKANs to represent better intricate relationships between input parameters and output fields, resulting in more accurate predictions across various mechanics problems. Specifically, we evaluate DeepOKAN's performance on several mechanics problems, including 1D sinusoidal waves, 2D orthotropic elasticity, and transient Poisson's problem, consistently achieving lower training losses and more accurate predictions compared to traditional DeepONets. This approach should pave the way for further improving the performance of neural operators.">

Physics-informed convolutional neural networks (PICNNs) extend PINNs by leveraging CNNs for enhanced generalization and efficiency. However, current PICNNs depend on manual design, and inappropriate designs may not effectively solve PDEs. Furthermore, due to the diversity of physical problems, the ideal network architectures and loss functions vary across different PDEs. It is impractical to find the optimal PICNN architecture and loss function for each specific physical problem through extensive manual experimentation. To surmount these challenges, this paper uses automated machine learning (AutoML) to automatically and efficiently search for the loss functions and network architectures of PICNNs. We introduce novel search spaces for loss functions and network architectures and propose a two-stage search strategy. The first stage focuses on searching for factors and residual adjustment operations that influence the loss function, while the second stage aims to find the best CNN architecture. Experimental results show that our automatic searching method significantly outperforms the manually-designed model on multiple datasets.">

The results indicate that the PG-PhyCRNet excels in capturing long-term evolution and enhances the model's extrapolation capability for solitons, particularly those with steep waveforms and high wave speeds. Finally, the robustness of the PG-PhyCRNet method and its effect on the prediction of solutions in different scenarios are confirmed through repeated experiments involving pseudo grid partitioning.">

        <tr id="We developed a novel reservoir characterization workflow that addresses reservoir history matching by coupling a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) forward model with a mixture of experts' approach, termed cluster classify regress (CCR). The inverse modelling is achieved via an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman inversion (aREKI) method, ideal for rapid inverse uncertainty quantification during history matching. We parametrize unknown permeability and porosity fields for non-Gaussian posterior measures using a variational convolution autoencoder and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) exotic priors. The CCR works as a supervised model with the PINO surrogate to replicate nonlinear Peaceman well equations. The CCR's flexibility allows any independent machine-learning algorithm for each stage. The PINO reservoir surrogate's loss function is derived from supervised data loss and losses from the initial conditions and residual of the governing black oil PDE. The PINO-CCR surrogate outputs pressure, water, and gas saturations, along with oil, water, and gas production rates. The methodology was compared to a standard numerical black oil simulator for a waterflooding case on the Norne field, showing similar outputs. This PINO-CCR surrogate was then used in the aREKI history matching workflow, successfully recovering the unknown permeability, porosity and fault multiplier, with simulations up to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. Training the PINO-CCR surrogate on an NVIDIA H100 with 80G memory takes about 5 hours for 100 samples of the Norne field. This workflow is suitable for ensemble-based approaches, where posterior density sampling, given an expensive likelihood evaluation, is desirable for uncertainty quantification.">

DNNs are widely used to predict phenomena in physics and mechanics. One of the issues with DNNs is that their output does not always satisfy physical equations. One approach to consider with physical equations is adding a residual of the equations into the loss function; this is called physics-informed neural network (PINN). One feature of PINNs is that the physical equations and corresponding residuals must be implemented as part of a neural network model. In addition, the residual does not always converge to a small value. The proposed model is a physics-guided generative adversarial network (PG-GAN) that uses a GAN architecture, in which physical equations are used to judge whether the neural network’s output is consistent with physics.

However, PINNs are not well suited for solving PDEs with multiscale features, particularly suffering from slow convergence and poor accuracy. To address this limitation of PINNs, this article proposes physics-informed cell representations for resolving multiscale Poisson problems using a model architecture consisting of multilevel multiresolution grids coupled with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The grid parameters (i.e., the level-dependent feature vectors) and the MLP parameters (i.e., the weights and biases) are determined using gradient-descent based optimization. The variational (weak) form based loss function accelerates computation by allowing the linear interpolation of feature vectors within grid cells. This cell-based MLP model also facilitates the use of a decoupled training scheme for Dirichlet boundary conditions and a parameter-sharing scheme for periodic boundary conditions, delivering superior accuracy compared to conventional PINNs. Furthermore, the numerical examples highlight improved speed and accuracy in solving PDEs with nonlinear or high-frequency boundary conditions and provide insights into hyperparameter selection. In essence, by cell-based MLP model along with the parallel tiny-cuda-nn library, our implementation improves convergence speed and numerical accuracy.">

Traditional numerical methods for these problems are mesh-based, thus struggling with the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising solution due to their universal approximation, generalization ability, and mesh-free training. In principle, Monte Carlo fractional PINN (MC-fPINN) estimates fractional derivatives using Monte Carlo methods and thus could lift CoD. However, this may cause significant variance and errors, hence affecting convergence; in addition, MC-fPINN is sensitive to hyperparameters. In general, numerical methods and specifically PINNs for tempered fractional PDEs are under-developed. Herein, we extend MC-fPINN to tempered fractional PDEs to address these issues, resulting in the Monte Carlo tempered fractional PINN (MC-tfPINN). To reduce possible high variance and errors from Monte Carlo sampling, we replace the one-dimensional (1D) Monte Carlo with 1D Gaussian quadrature, applicable to both MC-fPINN and MC-tfPINN. We validate our methods on various forward and inverse problems of fractional and tempered fractional PDEs, scaling up to 100,000 dimensions.

        <tr id="On the forefront of scientific computing, Deep Learning (DL), i.e., machine learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has emerged a powerful new tool for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have garnered widespread use for solving a variety of complex partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, when addressing certain specific problem types, traditional sampling algorithms still reveal deficiencies in efficiency and precision. In response, this paper builds upon the progress of adaptive sampling techniques, addressing the inadequacy of existing algorithms to fully leverage the spatial location information of sample points, and introduces an innovative adaptive sampling method. This approach incorporates the Dual Inverse Distance Weighting (DIDW) algorithm, embedding the spatial characteristics of sampling points within the probability sampling process. Furthermore, it introduces reward factors derived from reinforcement learning principles to dynamically refine the probability sampling formula. This strategy more effectively captures the essential characteristics of PDEs with each iteration. We utilize sparsely connected networks and have adjusted the sampling process, which has proven to effectively reduce the training time. In numerical experiments on fluid mechanics problems, such as the two-dimensional Burgers’ equation with sharp solutions, pipe flow, flow around a circular cylinder, lid-driven cavity flow, and Kovasznay flow, our proposed adaptive sampling algorithm markedly enhances accuracy over conventional PINN methods, validating the algorithm’s efficacy.">

Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

End-to-end machine learning approaches to inverse problems typically require constructing sophisticated estimators to achieve the desired accuracy, largely because they need to learn the complex underlying physical model. Here, we discuss an alternative paradigm: by making the physical model auto-differentiable we can construct a neural surrogate to represent the unknown physical quantity sought, while avoiding having to relearn the known physics entirely. We dub this process surrogate training embedded in physics (STEP) and illustrate that it generalizes well and is robust against overfitting and significant noise in the data. We demonstrate how STEP can be applied to perform dynamic kernel deconvolution to analyse resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra and show that surprisingly simple estimator architectures suffice to extract the relevant physical information.">

To aid in both stable training and enhanced accuracy over a variety of problems, we present (1) a family of orthogonality constraints that impose mutual orthogonality between the polynomial and the DNN within a PANN; (2) a simple basis pruning approach to combat the curse of dimensionality introduced by the polynomial component; and (3) an adaptation of a polynomial preconditioning strategy to both DNNs and polynomials. We test the resulting architecture for its polynomial reproduction properties, ability to approximate both smooth functions and functions of limited smoothness, and as a method for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Through these experiments, we demonstrate that PANNs offer superior approximation properties to DNNs for both regression and the numerical solution of PDEs, while also offering enhanced accuracy over both polynomial and DNN-based regression (each) when regressing functions with limited smoothness.">

Machine learning techniques are a relatively recent method for solving PDEs. Despite the increasing number of machine learning strategies developed to approximate PDEs, many remain focused on relatively small domains. When scaling the equations, a large domain is naturally obtained, especially when the solution exhibits multiscale characteristics. This study examines two-scale equations whose solution structures exhibit distinct characteristics: highly localized in some regions and significantly flat in others. These two regions must be adequately addressed over a large domain to approximate the solution more accurately. We focus on the vanishing gradient problem given by the diminishing gradient zone of the activation function over large domains and propose a stratified sampling algorithm to address this problem. We compare the uniform random classical sampling method over the entire domain and the proposed stratified sampling method. The numerical results confirm that the proposed method yields more accurate and consistent solutions than classical methods.">

Traditional PINN approaches often utilize fully connected network (FCN) architecture, which is susceptible to overfitting, training instability, and gradient vanishing issues as the network depth increases. These challenges result in accuracy bottlenecks in the solution. In response to these issues, the Residual-based Resample Physics-Informed Neural Network(R2-PINN) is proposed, which proposes an improved PINN architecture that replaces the FCN with a Convolutional Neural Network with a shortcut(S-CNN), incorporating skip connections to facilitate gradient propagation between network layers. Additionally, the incorporation of the Residual Adaptive Resampling (RAR) mechanism dynamically increases sampling points, enhancing the spatial representation capabilities and overall predictive accuracy of the model. The experimental results illustrate that our approach significantly improves the model's convergence capability, achieving high-precision predictions of physical fields.

In this work, we introduce a deep learning approach where the physical system is modeled as a sequence of coarse-to-fine Gaussian prior distributions parametrized by a neural network.

Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs.

Motivated by this gap, we propose an efficient method to evaluate long-term risk probabilities and their gradients using short-term samples without sufficient risk events. We first derive that four types of long-term risk probability are solutions of certain partial differential equations (PDEs). Then, we propose a physics-informed learning technique that integrates data and physics information (aforementioned PDEs). The physics information helps propagate information beyond available data and obtain provable generalization beyond available data, which in turn enables long-term risk to be estimated using short-term samples of safe events.

We categorized the loss parameters into two groups: one dependent on the tube's diameter and another constant, independent of it. The latter were set as the trainable parameters of the neural network. The problem of identifying the loss parameter was formulated as an optimization problem, with the physical properties being determined through this process. The neural network architecture employed was based on our previously proposed ResoNet, which is designed for analyzing acoustic resonance. The efficacy of the proposed method is assessed through both forward and inverse analysis, specifically through the identification of loss parameters. The findings demonstrate that it is feasible to accurately identify parameters that significantly impact the sound field under analysis.

The results demonstrate that the temporal evolution of O-atom density predicted by both the FNN and the 0D model aligns closely with the measurements obtained from the fast ionization wave discharge. Furthermore, the differences in O-atom density between the predictions and measurements are the same order of magnitude.

Traditional scientic computing relies on mathematical equations to describe and predict the scientic laws of nature, while deep learning provides a new perspective to solve complex mathematical problems by learning patterns in data. The introduction of the Physical Information Neural Network (PINN) and the Ordinary Dierential Equation (ODENet) network layer enables deep learning technology to more accurately simulate and predict scientic phenomena. This study shows that by embedding an ODE-Net network layer in a physical information neural network (PINN), the tting accuracy and generalization performance of the model can be signicantly improved. Experimental results show that compared with traditional numerical methods and fully connected neural networks, this model combined with deep learning technology not only shows higher accuracy when solving partial dierential equations, but also exhibits faster convergence speed and stronger adaptability. These ndings not only promote the integration of scientic computing and deep learning, but also provide new research directions and practical strategies for using deep learning technology to solve complex scientic problems.">

        <tr id="The Deep operator network (DeepONet) is a powerful yet simple neural operator architecture that utilizes two deep neural networks to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain. However, it imposes a strict constraint on the input space, requiring all input functions to be discretized at the same locations; this limits its practical applications. In this work, we introduce a Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) that provides a framework to make DeepONet resolution-independent, enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose a dictionary learning algorithm to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from the input data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which can be directly used by DeepONet without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as our trainable INR basis functions. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.">

        <tr id="Mathematical solvers use parametrized Optimization Problems (OPs) as inputs to yield optimal decisions. In many real-world settings, some of these parameters are unknown or uncertain. Recent research focuses on predicting the value of these unknown parameters using available contextual features, aiming to decrease decision regret by adopting end-to-end learning approaches. However, these approaches disregard prediction uncertainty and therefore make the mathematical solver susceptible to provide erroneous decisions in case of low-confidence predictions. We propose a novel framework that models prediction uncertainty with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and propagates this uncertainty into the mathematical solver with a Stochastic Programming technique. The differentiable nature of BNNs and differentiable mathematical solvers allow for two different learning approaches: In the Decoupled learning approach, we update the BNN weights to increase the quality of the predictions' distribution of the OP parameters, while in the Combined learning approach, we update the weights aiming to directly minimize the expected OP's cost function in a stochastic end-to-end fashion. We do an extensive evaluation using synthetic data with various noise properties and a real dataset, showing that decisions regret are generally lower (better) with both proposed methods.">

However, for complex problems, training these networks can still be challenging, often resulting in unsatisfactory accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that the failure of plain physics-informed neural networks arises from the significant discrepancy in the convergence speed of residuals at different training points, where the slowest convergence speed dominates the overall solution convergence. Based on these observations, we propose a point-wise adaptive weighting method that balances the residual decay rate across different training points. The performance of our proposed adaptive weighting method is compared with current state-of-the-art adaptive weighting methods on benchmark problems for both physics-informed neural networks and physics-informed deep operator networks. Through extensive numerical results we demonstrate that our proposed approach of balanced residual decay rates offers several advantages, including bounded weights, high prediction accuracy, fast convergence speed, low training uncertainty, low computational cost and ease of hyperparameter tuning.">

However, quantifying uncertainty on high-dimensional predictions is still a severely under-invested problem, especially when input-output relationships are non-linear. To handle this problem, the present work introduces an innovative approach that combines autoencoder deep neural networks with the probabilistic regression capabilities of Gaussian processes. The autoencoder provides a low-dimensional representation of the solution space, while the Gaussian process is a Bayesian method that provides a probabilistic mapping between the low-dimensional inputs and outputs. We validate the proposed framework for its application to surrogate modeling of non-linear finite element simulations. Our findings highlight that the proposed framework is computationally efficient as well as accurate in predicting non-linear deformations of solid bodies subjected to external forces, all the while providing insightful uncertainty assessments.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems, e.g. in climate and engineering sciences, often necessitates solving partial differential equations. Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

Our model can provide solutions for different values of PDE parameters without any need for retraining the network. The training is carried out in a self-supervised manner, similar to pretraining approaches applied in language and vision tasks. We hypothesize that the model is in effect learning a family of operators (for multiple parameters) mapping the initial condition to the solution of the PDE at any future time step t. We compare this approach with the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and demonstrate that it can generalize over the space of PDE parameters, despite having a higher prediction error for individual parameter values compared to the FNO. We show that performance on a specific parameter can be improved by finetuning the model with very small amounts of data. We also demonstrate that the model scales with data as well as model size.">

        <tr id="In recent years, surrogate models based on deep neural networks have been widely used to solve partial differential equations for fluid flow physics. This kind of model focuses on global interpolation of the training data and thus requires a large network structure. The process is both time consuming and computationally costly. In the present study, we develop a neural network with local converging input (NNLCI) for high-fidelity prediction using unstructured data. The framework uses the local domain of dependence with converging coarse solutions as input, thereby greatly reducing computational resource and training time. As a validation case, the NNLCI method is applied to study two-dimensional inviscid supersonic flows in channels with bumps. Different bump geometries and locations are examined to benchmark the effectiveness and versatility of this new approach. The NNLCI method can accurately and efficiently capture the structure and dynamics of the entire flowfield, including regions with shock discontinuities. For a new bump configuration, the method can perform prediction with only one neural network, eliminating the need for repeated training of multiple networks for different geometries. A saving of computing wall time is achieved by several orders of magnitude against the high-fidelity simulation with the same level of accuracy. The demand on training data is modest, and the training data can be allocated sparsely. These features are especially advantageous compared with conventional global-to-global deep learning methods and physics-informed methods.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural network (PINN) has aroused broad interest among fluid simulation researchers in recent years, representing a novel paradigm in this area where governing differential equations are encoded to provide a hybrid physics-based and data-driven deep learning framework. However, the lack of enough validations on more complex flow problems has restricted further development and application of PINN. Our research applies the PINN to simulate a two-dimensional indoor turbulent airflow case to address the issue. Although it is still quite challenging for the PINN to reach an ideal accuracy for the problem through a single purely physics-driven training, our research finds that the PINN prediction accuracy can be significantly improved by exploiting its ability to assimilate high-fidelity data during training, by which the prediction accuracy of PINN is enhanced by 53.2% for pressure, 34.6% for horizontal velocity, and 40.4% for vertical velocity, respectively. Meanwhile, the influence of data points number is also studied, which suggests a balance between prediction accuracy and data acquisition cost can be reached. Last but not least, applying Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations and turbulence model has also been proved to improve prediction accuracy remarkably. After embedding the standard k–ε model to the PINN, the prediction accuracy was enhanced by 82.9% for pressure, 59.4% for horizontal velocity, and 70.5% for vertical velocity, respectively. These results suggest a promising step toward applications of PINN to more complex flow configurations.">

While computational fluid dynamics is precise, it is computationally impractical for real-time control. Lumped thermal models divide the room into cells and explicitly model inter-cell air-mixing. However, solving the coupled differential equations is still computationally challenging. Data-driven methods like long-short term memory may handle non-linear thermal dynamics but face limitations in observability, adherence to physical constraints, and generalization. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) impose physical constraints even while learning from data. However, PINNs still lack the scalability required for effective control in large open-plan offices, primarily due to air-mixing interactions Our approach, PhyGICS, combines graph neural networks with physics-informed learning (PI-GNN) to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we model the thermodynamic interactions as edges between nodes that represent cells. Further, the modeling approach allows explicit modeling of wall and window surface temperatures that are commonly ignored. PhyGICS, utilizing PI-GNN as a state-estimator, employs a receding-horizon approach for optimal HVAC control. We adapt PI-GNNs for building HVAC control by incorporating a time-resetting strategy to handle time-dependent ambient conditions and therefore set-points. Evaluations in a simulated environment with real-world data show PhyGICS outperforms a regular PINN model and other baseline control strategies on: 1) thermal model accuracy; 2) computation time; 3) energy consumption; and 4) user comfort.">

This paper presents the Fractional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (fKAN), a novel neural network architecture that incorporates the distinctive attributes of KANs with a trainable adaptive fractional-orthogonal Jacobi function as its basis function. By leveraging the unique mathematical properties of fractional Jacobi functions, including simple derivative formulas, non-polynomial behavior, and activity for both positive and negative input values, this approach ensures efficient learning and enhanced accuracy. The proposed architecture is evaluated across a range of tasks in deep learning and physics-informed deep learning. Precision is tested on synthetic regression data, image classification, image denoising, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, the performance is measured on various differential equations, including ordinary, partial, and fractional delay differential equations. The results demonstrate that integrating fractional Jacobi functions into KANs significantly improves training speed and performance across diverse fields and applications.">

        <tr id="Analyzing the motion of multiple biological agents, be it cells or individual animals, is pivotal for the understanding of complex collective behaviors. With the advent of advanced microscopy, detailed images of complex tissue formations involving multiple cell types have become more accessible in recent years. However, deciphering the underlying rules that govern cell movements is far from trivial. Here, we present a novel deep learning framework to estimate the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the function of two-body interactions, thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.">

We introduce two innovative models rooted in boundary integral equations (BIEs): the Boundary Integral Type Deep Operator Network (BI-DeepONet) and the Boundary Integral Trigonometric Deep Operator Neural Network (BI-TDONet), which are crafted to address PDEs across diverse domains. Once fully trained, these BIE-based models adeptly predict the solutions of PDEs in any domain without the need for additional training. BI-TDONet notably enhances its performance by employing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of bounded linear operators, allowing for the efficient distribution of input functions across its modules. Furthermore, to tackle the issue of function sampling values that do not effectively capture oscillatory and impulse signal characteristics, trigonometric coefficients are utilized as both inputs and outputs in BI-TDONet.

        <tr id="Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve the PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a specific set of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation or a finite set of coefficients. This bottleneck limits the generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major advantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a Transformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable generalizability and scalability.">

We demonstrate through numerical results that, relying on the derived algorithm to identify the inertia tensor of a nanosatellite, we can achieve improved estimation accuracy and robustness, by integrating physical constraints and leveraging partial knowledge of the system dynamics.

        <tr id="We introduce a method that combines neural operators, physics-informed machine learning, and standard numerical methods for solving PDEs. The proposed approach extends each of the aforementioned methods and unifies them within a single framework. We can parametrically solve partial differential equations in a data-free manner and provide accurate sensitivities, meaning the derivatives of the solution space with respect to the design space. These capabilities enable gradient-based optimization without the typical sensitivity analysis costs, unlike adjoint methods that scale directly with the number of response functions. Our Finite Operator Learning (FOL) approach uses an uncomplicated feed-forward neural network model to directly map the discrete design space (i.e. parametric input space) to the discrete solution space (i.e. finite number of sensor points in the arbitrary shape domain) ensuring compliance with physical laws by designing them into loss functions. The discretized governing equations, as well as the design and solution spaces, can be derived from any well-established numerical techniques. In this work, we employ the Finite Element Method (FEM) to approximate fields and their spatial derivatives. Subsequently, we conduct Sobolev training to minimize a multi-objective loss function, which includes the discretized weak form of the energy functional, boundary conditions violations, and the stationarity of the residuals with respect to the design variables. Our study focuses on the steady-state heat equation within heterogeneous materials that exhibits significant phase contrast and possibly temperature-dependent conductivity. The network's tangent matrix is directly used for gradient-based optimization to improve the microstructure's heat transfer characteristics. ...">

        <tr id="We propose physics-informed holomorphic neural networks (PIHNNs) as a method to solve boundary value problems where the solution can be represented via holomorphic functions. Specifically, we consider the case of plane linear elasticity and, by leveraging the Kolosov-Muskhelishvili representation of the solution in terms of holomorphic potentials, we train a complex-valued neural network to fulfill stress and displacement boundary conditions while automatically satisfying the governing equations. This is achieved by designing the network to return only approximations that inherently satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions through specific choices of layers and activation functions. To ensure generality, we provide a universal approximation theorem guaranteeing that, under basic assumptions, the proposed holomorphic neural networks can approximate any holomorphic function. Furthermore, we suggest a new tailored weight initialization technique to mitigate the issue of vanishing/exploding gradients. Compared to the standard PINN approach, noteworthy benefits of the proposed method for the linear elasticity problem include a more efficient training, as evaluations are needed solely on the boundary of the domain, lower memory requirements, due to the reduced number of training points, and $C^\infty$ regularity of the learned solution. Several benchmark examples are used to verify the correctness of the obtained PIHNN approximations, the substantial benefits over traditional PINNs, and the possibility to deal with non-trivial, multiply-connected geometries via a domain-decomposition strategy.">

To address this issue, we propose and formulate the Physical Trajectory Residual Learning (DeltaPhi), which learns to predict the physical residuals between the pending solved trajectory and a known similar auxiliary trajectory. First, we transform the direct operator mapping between input-output function fields in original training data to residual operator mapping between input function pairs and output function residuals. Next, we learn the surrogate model for the residual operator mapping based on existing neural operator networks. Additionally, we design helpful customized auxiliary inputs for efficient optimization. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that, compared to direct learning, physical residual learning is preferred for PDE solving.">

        <tr id="Sampling invariant distributions from an Ito diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in both biased and correlated samples. Current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from the base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for mini-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Distinct from conventional generative models, our method neither necessitates the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centres selected from the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we introduce the neural empirical interpolation method (NEIM), a neural network-based alternative to the discrete empirical interpolation method for reducing the time complexity of computing the nonlinear term in a reduced order model (ROM) for a parameterized nonlinear partial differential equation. NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some"optimal"coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.">

        <tr id="Physics‐Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have solved numerous mechanics problems by training to minimize the loss functions of governing partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite successful development of PINNs in various systems, computational efficiency and fidelity prediction have remained profound challenges. To fill such gaps, this study proposed a Physics‐Informed Neural Operator Solver (PINOS) to achieve accurate and fast simulations without any required data set. The training of PINOS adopts a weak form based on the principle of least work for static simulations and a storng form for dynamic systems in solid mechanics. Results from numerical examples indicated that PINOS is capable of approximating solutions notably faster than the benchmarks of PINNs in both static an dynamic systems. The comparisons also showed that PINOS reached a convergence speed of over 20 times faster than finite element software in two‐dimensional and three‐dimensional static problems. Furthermore, this study examined the zero‐shot super‐resolution capability by developing Super‐Resolution PINOS (SR‐PINOS) that was trained on a coarse mesh and validated on fine mesh. The numerical results demonstrate the great performance of the model to obtain accurate solutions with a speed up, suggesting effectiveness in increasing sampling points and scaling a simulation. This study also discusses the differentiation methods of PINOS and SR‐PINOS and suggests potential implementations related to forward applications for promising machine learning methods for structural designs and optimization.">

        <tr id="Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a principled framework for modeling uncertainty in deep learning tasks. However, conventional BNNs often suffer from high computational complexity and parameter overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed Probabilistic BNN (ProbBNN), which leverages probabilistic computing principles to streamline the inference process. Unlike traditional deterministic approaches, ProbBNN represents inputs and parameters as random variables governed by probability distributions, allowing for the propagation of uncertainty throughout the network. We employ Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to represent the parameters of each neuron or convolutional kernel, enabling efficient encoding and processing of uncertainty. Our approach simplifies the inference process by replacing complex deterministic computations with lightweight probabilistic operations, resulting in reduced computational complexity and improved scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbBNN in achieving competitive accuracy to traditional BNNs while significantly reducing the number of parameters. The transition to ProbBNN yields a reduction of two orders of magnitude in the number of parameters compared to baseline approaches, making our approach promising for deployment in resource-constrained applications such as edge computing and IoT devices.">

These additions have the aim of reintroducing contributions that in standard ROMs are not taken into account. In particular, in this work we consider two types of contributions: the turbulence modeling, added through a reduced-order approximation of the eddy viscosity field, and the correction model, aimed to re-introduce the contribution of the discarded modes. Both approaches have been investigated in previous works and the goal of this paper is to extend the model to a parametric setting making use of ad-hoc machine learning procedures. More in detail, we investigate different neural networks' architectures, from simple dense feed-forward to Long-Short Term Memory neural networks, in order to find the most suitable model for the re-introduced contributions. We tested the methods on two test cases with different behaviors: the periodic turbulent flow past a circular cylinder and the unsteady turbulent flow in a channel-driven cavity. In both cases, the parameter considered is the Reynolds number and the machine learning-enhanced ROM considerably improved the pressure and velocity accuracy with respect to the standard ROM.">

        <tr id="In metal additive manufacturing (AM), precise temperature field prediction is crucial for process monitoring, automation, control, and optimization. Traditional methods, primarily offline and data-driven, struggle with adapting to real-time changes and new process scenarios, which limits their applicability for effective AM process control. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the first physics-informed (PI) online learning framework specifically designed for temperature prediction in metal AM. Utilizing a physics-informed neural network (PINN), this framework integrates a neural network architecture with physics-informed inputs and loss functions. Pretrained on a known process to establish a baseline, the PINN transitions to an online learning phase, dynamically updating its weights in response to new, unseen data. This adaptation allows the model to continuously refine its predictions in real-time. By integrating physics-informed components, the PINN leverages prior knowledge about the manufacturing processes, enabling rapid adjustments to process parameters, geometries, deposition patterns, and materials. Empirical results confirm the robust performance of this PI online learning framework in accurately predicting temperature fields for unseen processes across various conditions. It notably surpasses traditional data-driven models, especially in critical areas like the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) and melt pool. The PINN’s use of physical laws and prior knowledge not only provides a significant advantage over conventional models but also ensures more accurate predictions under diverse conditions. Furthermore, our analysis of key hyperparameters—the learning rate and batch size of the online learning phase—highlights their roles in optimizing the learning process and enhancing the framework’s overall effectiveness. This approach demonstrates significant potential to improve the online control and optimization of metal AM processes.">

While these operators perform effectively in either the time or frequency domain, their performance may be limited when applied to non-stationary spatial or temporal signals whose frequency characteristics change with time.

Theoretically, we prove the universal approximation capability of CoNO. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of CoNO on seven challenging partial differential equations (PDEs), including regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds. Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data. Altogether, CoNO presents a robust and superior model for modeling continuous dynamical systems, providing a fillip to scientific machine learning.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

Unfortunately, ANNs can fail to generalize if the data is insufficient. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) can improve convergence while lowering the required data amounts. This paper investigates the PINN methodology systematically by considering varying amounts of data and physics collocation points. This work considers the rotationally symmetric Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) formulation. Initially, a baseline fully data-driven ANN is studied to determine a suitable network size. Then, multiple PINN-based wake surrogates are trained with continuity and momentum conservation knowledge, varying amounts of data, and physics collocation points. It was found that including physics information under the best circumstances could improve accuracy by 18% at the cost of increasing the training time by a factor of 116. The findings imply that physics information can improve neural network based wake surrogates.">

        <tr id="Modeling real-world problems with partial differential equations (PDEs) is a prominent topic in scientific machine learning. Classic solvers for this task continue to play a central role, e.g. to generate training data for deep learning analogues. Any such numerical solution is subject to multiple sources of uncertainty, both from limited computational resources and limited data (including unknown parameters). Gaussian process analogues to classic PDE simulation methods have recently emerged as a framework to construct fully probabilistic estimates of all these types of uncertainty. So far, much of this work focused on theoretical foundations, and as such is not particularly data efficient or scalable. Here we propose a framework combining a discretization scheme based on the popular Finite Volume Method with complementary numerical linear algebra techniques. Practical experiments, including a spatiotemporal tsunami simulation, demonstrate substantially improved scaling behavior of this approach over previous collocation-based techniques.">

        <tr id="Data-driven deep learning has emerged as the new paradigm to model complex physical space-time systems. These data-driven methods learn patterns by optimizing statistical metrics and tend to overlook the adherence to physical laws, unlike traditional model-driven numerical methods. Thus, they often generate predictions that are not physically realistic. On the other hand, by sampling a large amount of high quality predictions from a data-driven model, some predictions will be more physically plausible than the others and closer to what will happen in the future. Based on this observation, we propose \emph{Beam search by Vector Quantization} (BeamVQ) to enhance the physical alignment of data-driven space-time forecasting models. The key of BeamVQ is to train model on self-generated samples filtered with physics-aware metrics. To be flexibly support different backbone architectures, BeamVQ leverages a code bank to transform any encoder-decoder model to the continuous state space into discrete codes. Afterwards, it iteratively employs beam search to sample high-quality sequences, retains those with the highest physics-aware scores, and trains model on the new dataset. Comprehensive experiments show that BeamVQ not only gave an average statistical skill score boost for more than 32% for ten backbones on five datasets, but also significantly enhances physics-aware metrics.">

It has been showcased that a combination of optimization techniques extended and adapted from the PINNs literature, and the introduction of specific techniques inspired by the MPF Method background, is required. The numerical resolution is realized through a multi-variable time-series problem by using fully discrete resolution. Within each interval, space, time, and phases are treated separately, constituting discrete subdomains. An extended multi-networking concept is implemented to subdivide the simulation domain into multiple batches, with each batch associated with an independent Neural Network trained to predict the solution. To ensure efficient interaction across different phasesand in the spatio-temporal-phasic subdomain, a Master NN handles efficient interaction among the multiple networks, as well as the transfer of learning in different directions. A set of systematic simulations with increasing complexity was performed, that benchmarks various critical aspects of MPF simulations, including different geometries, types of interface dynamics and the evolution of an interfacial triple junction. A comprehensive approach is adopted to specifically focus the attention on the interfacial regions through an automatic and dynamic meshing process, significantly simplifying the tuning of hyper-parameters and serving as a fundamental key for addressing MPF problems using Machine Learning. The pyramidal training approach is proposed to the PINN community as a dual-impact method: it facilitates the initialization of training and allows an extended transfer of learning. The proposed PINNs-MPF framework successfully reproduces benchmark tests with high fidelity and Mean Squared Error loss values ranging from 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ compared to ground truth solutions.">

        <tr id="Introduction. Many mathematical problems are reduced to solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in domains of complex shapes. Existing analytical and numerical methods do not always provide efficient solutions for such problems. Recently, neural networks have been successfully applied to solve PDEs, typically addressing boundary value problems for domains with simple shapes. This paper attempts to construct a neural network capable of effectively solving boundary value problems for domains of complex shapes.Materials and Methods. A method for constructing a neural network to solve the Dirichlet problem for regions of complex shape is proposed. Derivatives of singular solutions of the Laplace equation are accepted as activation functions. Singular points of these solutions are distributed along closed curves encompassing the boundary of the domain. The adjustment of the network weights is reduced to minimizing the root-mean-square error during training.Results. The results of solving Dirichlet problems for various complex-shaped domains are presented. The results are provided in tables, comparing the exact solution and the solution obtained using the neural network. Figures show the domain shapes and the locations of points where the solutions were determined.Discussion and Conclusion. The presented results indicate a good agreement between the obtained solution and the exact one. It is noted that this method can be easily applied to various boundary value problems. Methods for enhancing the efficiency of such neural networks are suggested.">

        <tr id="Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a methodology for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network. It presets the weight/bias coefficients in the hidden layer with random values, which remain fixed throughout the computation, and uses a linear least squares method for training the parameters of the output layer of the neural network. It is known to be much faster than Physics informed neural networks. However, classical ELM is still computationally expensive when a high level of representation is desired in the solution as this requires solving a large least squares system. In this paper, we propose a nonoverlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) for ELMs that not only reduces the training time of ELMs, but is also suitable for parallel computation. In numerical analysis, DDMs have been widely studied to reduce the time to obtain finite element solutions for elliptic PDEs through parallel computation. Among these approaches, nonoverlapping DDMs are attracting the most attention. Motivated by these methods, we introduce local neural networks, which are valid only at corresponding subdomains, and an auxiliary variable at the interface. We construct a system on the variable and the parameters of local neural networks. A Schur complement system on the interface can be derived by eliminating the parameters of the output layer. The auxiliary variable is then directly obtained by solving the reduced system after which the parameters for each local neural network are solved in parallel. A method for initializing the hidden layer parameters suitable for high approximation quality in large systems is also proposed. Numerical results that verify the acceleration performance of the proposed method with respect to the number of subdomains are presented.">

        <tr id="This paper is about learning the parameter-to-solution map for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) that depend on a potentially large number of parameters covering all PDE types for which a stable variational formulation (SVF) can be found. A central constituent is the notion of variationally correct residual loss function meaning that its value is always uniformly proportional to the squared solution error in the norm determined by the SVF, hence facilitating rigorous a posteriori accuracy control. It is based on a single variational problem, associated with the family of parameter dependent fiber problems, employing the notion of direct integrals of Hilbert spaces. Since in its original form the loss function is given as a dual test norm of the residual a central objective is to develop equivalent computable expressions. A first critical role is played by hybrid hypothesis classes, whose elements are piecewise polynomial in (low-dimensional) spatio-temporal variables with parameter-dependent coefficients that can be represented, e.g. by neural networks. Second, working with first order SVFs, we distinguish two scenarios: (i) the test space can be chosen as an $L_2$-space (e.g. for elliptic or parabolic problems) so that residuals live in $L_2$ and can be evaluated directly; (ii) when trial and test spaces for the fiber problems (e.g. for transport equations) depend on the parameters, we use ultraweak formulations. In combination with Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin concepts the hybrid format is then instrumental to arrive at variationally correct computable residual loss functions. Our findings are illustrated by numerical experiments representing (i) and (ii), namely elliptic boundary value problems with piecewise constant diffusion coefficients and pure transport equations with parameter dependent convection field.">

Moreover, there are legitimate concerns regarding the generalization and reliability of such approaches, as they often overlook inherent physical constraints. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel machine-learning architecture that is highly generalizable and adheres to conservation laws and physical symmetries, thereby ensuring greater reliability. The foundation of this architecture is graph neural networks (GNNs), which are adept at accommodating a variety of shapes and forms. Additionally, we explore the parallels between GNNs and traditional numerical solvers, facilitating a seamless integration of conservative principles and symmetries into machine learning models. Our findings from experiments demonstrate that the model's inclusion of physical laws significantly enhances its generalizability, i.e., no significant accuracy degradation for unseen spatial domains while other models degrade.

In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

Within the realm of turbulent flow simulation, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is widely considered to be the most reliable approach, but it is prohibitively expensive for long-term simulation at fine spatial scales. Given the pressing need for efficient simulation, there is an increasing interest in building machine learning models for turbulence, either by reconstructing DNS from alternative low-fidelity simulations or by predicting DNS based on the patterns learned from historical data. However, standard machine learning techniques remain limited in capturing complex spatio-temporal characteristics of turbulent flows, resulting in limited performance and generalizability. This paper presents a novel physics-enhanced neural operator (PENO) that incorporates physical knowledge of partial differential equations (PDEs) to accurately model flow dynamics. The model is further refined by a self-augmentation mechanism to reduce the accumulated error in long-term simulations. The proposed method is evaluated through its performance on two distinct sets of 3D turbulent flow data, showcasing the model's capability to reconstruct high-resolution DNS data, maintain the inherent physical properties of flow transport, and generate flow simulations across various resolutions. Additionally, experimental results on multiple 2D vorticity flow series, generated by different PDEs, highlight the transferability and generalizability of the proposed method. This confirms its applicability to a wide range of real-world scenarios in which extensive simulations are needed under diverse settings.">

We provide a rigorous convergence statement of the method. The proof circumvents challenges posed by the ambiguity of discrete Lagrangian densities in the inverse problem of variational calculus. Moreover, our method can be used to quantify model uncertainty in the equations of motions and any linear observable of the discrete field theory. This is illustrated on the example of the discrete wave equation and Schr\"odinger equation. The article constitutes an extension of our previous article arXiv:2404.19626 for the data-driven identification of (discrete) Lagrangians for variational dynamics from an ode setting to the setting of discrete pdes.">

        <tr id="This work introduces neural Green's operators (NGOs), a novel neural operator network architecture that learns the solution operator for a parametric family of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our construction of NGOs is derived directly from the Green's formulation of such a solution operator. Similar to deep operator networks (DeepONets) and variationally mimetic operator networks (VarMiONs), NGOs constitutes an expansion of the solution to the PDE in terms of basis functions, that is returned from a sub-network, contracted with coefficients, that are returned from another sub-network. However, in accordance with the Green's formulation, NGOs accept weighted averages of the input functions, rather than sampled values thereof, as is the case in DeepONets and VarMiONs. Application of NGOs to canonical linear parametric PDEs shows that, while they remain competitive with DeepONets, VarMiONs and Fourier neural operators when testing on data that lie within the training distribution, they robustly generalize when testing on finer-scale data generated outside of the training distribution. Furthermore, we show that the explicit representation of the Green's function that is returned by NGOs enables the construction of effective preconditioners for numerical solvers for PDEs.">

Using Bayes Theorem and conditional probability densities, we demonstrate how each uncertainty source can be systematically quantified. We also introduce a fast and practical way to incorporate and combine all sources of errors for the first time. For illustration, the new method is applied to quantify errors in cloud autoconversion rates, predicted from an artificial neural network that was trained by aircraft cloud probe measurements in the Azores and the stochastic collection equation formulated as a two-moment bin model. For this specific example, the output uncertainty arising from uncertainty in the training and testing data is dominant, followed by uncertainty in the input data, in the trained neural network, and uncertainty in the weights. We discuss the usefulness of the methodology for machine learning practice, and how, through inclusion of uncertainty in the training data, the new methodology is less sensitive to input data that falls outside of the training data set.">

        <tr id="Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is an inverse problem for estimating the wave velocity distribution in a given domain, based on observed data on the boundaries. The inversion is computationally demanding because we are required to solve multiple forward problems, either in time or frequency domains, to simulate data that are then iteratively fitted to the observed data. We consider FWI in the frequency domain, where the Helmholtz equation is used as a forward model, and its repeated solution is the main computational bottleneck of the inversion process. To ease this cost, we integrate a learning process of an encoder-solver preconditioner that is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The encoder-solver is trained to effectively precondition the discretized Helmholtz operator given velocity medium parameters. Then, by re-training the CNN between the iterations of the optimization process, the encoder-solver is adapted to the iteratively evolving velocity medium as part of the inversion. Without retraining, the performance of the solver deteriorates as the medium changes. Using our light retraining procedures, we obtain the forward simulations effectively throughout the process. We demonstrate our approach to solving FWI problems using 2D geophysical models with high-frequency data.">

Hitherto, deep learning-based methods employed to model hysteresis, face challenges in generalizing to novel input magnetic fields. This paper addresses the generalization challenge by proposing neural operators for modeling constitutive laws that exhibit magnetic hysteresis by learning a mapping between magnetic fields. In particular, two prominent neural operators -- deep operator network and Fourier neural operator -- are employed to predict novel first-order reversal curves and minor loops, where novel means they are not used to train the model. In addition, a rate-independent Fourier neural operator is proposed to predict material responses at sampling rates different from those used during training to incorporate the rate-independent characteristics of magnetic hysteresis. The presented numerical experiments demonstrate that neural operators efficiently model magnetic hysteresis, outperforming the traditional neural recurrent methods on various metrics and generalizing to novel magnetic fields. The findings emphasize the advantages of using neural operators for modeling hysteresis under varying magnetic conditions, underscoring their importance in characterizing magnetic material based devices.">

Modern techniques for the solution of these problems typically combine Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) architecture with a time prediction mechanism.

In this work, we introduce a physically inspired architecture for the solution of such problems. Namely, we propose to augment CNNs with advection by designing a novel semi-Lagrangian push operator. We show that the proposed operator allows for the non-local transformation of information compared with standard convolutional kernels. We then complement it with Reaction and Diffusion neural components to form a network that mimics the Reaction-Advection-Diffusion equation, in high dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our network on a number of spatio-temporal datasets that show their merit.">

Fusing known physics into data-driven learners allows modelling practitioners to combine the expressive power of traditional machine learning with known mechanistic laws, where the objective is to enhance predictive performance, interpretability, and model generalisation. A core consideration that must be made when implementing a physics-informed learning architecture is how relevant knowledge will be embedded into the model structure, which, generally, is informed by the type of physics that is available. Frequently this knowledge may not be complete, with only a partial understanding of the governing physics available. 

In this work, possible paths for deriving Gaussian process kernels that are representative of partial knowledge will be considered. How the type of knowledge that is possessed influences the derivation will be explored, particularly when there is the potential for some aspect of misspecified physics. An example of deriving partially structured kernels will be investigated for modelling the decoupled response of a GARTEUR laboratory aircraft structure, where the derived kernels are used to decompose the dynamics of the aircraft into modal contributions.

We argue that residual is, at best, an indirect measure of the error of approximate solution and propose to train with error majorant instead. Since error majorant provides a direct upper bound on error, one can reliably estimate how close PiNN is to the exact solution and stop the optimization process when the desired accuracy is reached. We call loss function associated with error majorant $\textbf{Astral}$: neur$\textbf{A}$l a po$\textbf{ST}$erio$\textbf{RI}$ function$\textbf{A}$l Loss. To compare Astral and residual loss functions, we illustrate how error majorants can be derived for various PDEs and conduct experiments with diffusion equations (including anisotropic and in the L-shaped domain), convection-diffusion equation, temporal discretization of Maxwell's equation, and magnetostatics problem. The results indicate that Astral loss is competitive to the residual loss, typically leading to faster convergence and lower error (e.g., for Maxwell's equations, we observe an order of magnitude better relative error and training time). We also report that the error estimate obtained with Astral loss is usually tight enough to be informative, e.g., for a highly anisotropic equation, on average, Astral overestimates error by a factor of $1.5$, and for convection-diffusion by a factor of $1.7$.">

        <tr id="Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.">

Research over the past few years has shown that the answer to all these questions is likely"yes, with enough research": PNNs could one day radically change what is possible and practical for AI systems. To do this will however require rethinking both how AI models work, and how they are trained - primarily by considering the problems through the constraints of the underlying hardware physics. To train PNNs at large scale, many methods including backpropagation-based and backpropagation-free approaches are now being explored. These methods have various trade-offs, and so far no method has been shown to scale to the same scale and performance as the backpropagation algorithm widely used in deep learning today. However, this is rapidly changing, and a diverse ecosystem of training techniques provides clues for how PNNs may one day be utilized to create both more efficient realizations of current-scale AI models, and to enable unprecedented-scale models.">

        <tr id="Laplace approximations are popular techniques for endowing deep networks with epistemic uncertainty estimates as they can be applied without altering the predictions of the neural network, and they scale to large models and datasets. While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases. As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space. More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we have to recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network. Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize. After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra. Our method provides improved results where prior knowledge is abundant, e.g., in many scientific inference tasks. At the same time, it stays competitive for black-box regression and classification tasks where neural networks typically excel.">

For instance, predictions associated with a high degree of uncertainty could be sent for further evaluation. Recent works in uncertainty quantification of deep learning predictions, including Bayesian posterior credible intervals and a frequentist confidence-interval estimation, have proven to yield either invalid or overly conservative intervals. Furthermore, there is currently no method for quantifying uncertainty that can accommodate deep neural networks for survival (time-to-event) data that involves right-censored outcomes. In this work, we provide a valid non-parametric bootstrap method that correctly disentangles data uncertainty from the noise inherent in the adopted optimization algorithm, ensuring that the resulting point-wise confidence intervals or the simultaneous confidence bands are accurate (i.e., valid and not overly conservative). The proposed ad-hoc method can be easily integrated into any deep neural network without interfering with the training process. The utility of the proposed approach is illustrated by constructing simultaneous confidence bands for survival curves derived from deep neural networks for survival data with right censoring.">

Downstream applications of such simulations can become computationally infeasible if they require many forward solves, for example in the case of inverse design with many degrees of freedom. In this work, we investigate and extend neural PDE solvers as a tool to aid in scaling simulations for two-phase flow problems, and simulations of oil expulsion from a pore specifically. We extend existing numerical methods for this problem to a more complex setting involving varying geometries of the domain to generate a challenging dataset. Further, we investigate three prominent neural PDE solver methods, namely the UNet, DRN, and U-FNO, and extend them for characteristics of the oil-expulsion problem: (1) spatial conditioning on the geometry; (2) periodicity in the boundary; (3) approximate mass conservation. We scale all methods and benchmark their speed-accuracy trade-off, evaluate qualitative properties, and perform an ablation study. We find that the investigated methods can accurately model the droplet dynamics with up to three orders of magnitude speed-up, that our extensions improve performance over the baselines, and that the introduced varying geometries constitute a significantly more challenging setting over the previously considered oil expulsion problem.">

However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.">

Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

        <tr id="This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning (ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems found in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by differential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and hard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and no-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these constraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate algorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply training unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the differential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this approach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models innately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the well-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact) min-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for these infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then provide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are not only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even dominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly, these results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed problems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms used by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical systems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems with embedded optimal control problems.">

To address such challenge, we develop a hybrid finite element method (FEM) - NN optimization framework to learn complex hyperelastic constitutive relations from full-field data. The key advantage of this framework is that it can make use of the non-uniform displacement field due to the geometric inhomogeneities for training NN-based constitutive models. Since such data can provide many different stress-strain states in a single test, it can greatly reduce the number of experiments needed for the training of NNs. Besides, we adopt a mechanics-informed neural network (MINN) as our architecture to ensure that our NN-based models satisfy all necessary physical constraints by construction, such as objectivity, material symmetry, polyconvexity, etc. Such architecture is also key to the convergence of our optimization framework. We then use both synthetic and experimental data to test the performance of our proposed framework on various isotropic hyperelastic materials. Results show that our optimization framework can be used to train NN-based constitutive models for hyperelastic materials with high accuracy and efficiency using data generated from simple tests, which can also be easily adapted to characterize complex constitutive models for a broader range of materials.">

The current gold standard for inferring parameter distributions across cell populations is the Global Two Stage (GTS) approach for nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models. However, this method is computationally intensive, as it makes repeated use of non-convex optimization that in turn requires numerical integration of the underlying system. Here, we propose the Gradient Matching GTS (GMGTS) method as an efficient alternative to GTS. Gradient matching offers an integration-free approach to parameter estimation that is particularly powerful for dynamical systems that are linear in the unknown parameters, such as biochemical networks modeled by mass action kinetics. Here, we harness the power of gradient matching by integrating it into the GTS framework. To this end, we significantly expand the capabilities of gradient matching via uncertainty propagation calculations and the development of an iterative estimation scheme for partially observed systems. Through comparisons of GMGTS with GTS in different inference setups, we demonstrate that our method provides a significant computational advantage, thereby facilitating the use of complex NLME models in systems biology applications.">

However, this task becomes particularly challenging in turbulent flow, due to the complex and irregular changes in the flow field. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning method, named mapping network-coordinated stacked gated recurrent units (MSU), for predicting pressure on a circular cylinder from velocity data. Specifically, our coordinated learning strategy is designed to extract the most critical velocity point for prediction, a process that has not been explored before. In our experiments, MSU extracts one point from a velocity field containing 121 points and utilizes this point to accurately predict 100 pressure points on the cylinder. This method significantly reduces the workload of data measurement in practical engineering applications. Our experimental results demonstrate that MSU predictions are highly similar to the real turbulent data in both spatio-temporal and individual aspects. Furthermore, the comparison results show that MSU predicts more precise results, even outperforming models that use all velocity field points. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, MSU has an average improvement of more than 45% in various indicators such as root mean square error (RMSE). Through comprehensive and authoritative physical verification, we established that MSU's prediction results closely align with pressure field data obtained in real turbulence fields. This confirmation underscores the considerable potential of MSU for practical applications in real engineering scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzm0128/MSU.">

More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

However, the governing equations often involve coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDE), which are challenging to solve numerically. In particular, stiffness in the PDEs requires an extremely small time steps (e.g. $10^{-12}$ or smaller). This computational bottleneck is especially problematic when running LMD simulation until a late time horizon is required. This motivates the development of surrogate models capable of leaping forward in time, by skipping several consecutive time steps at-once. In this paper, we propose U-Shaped Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (U-AFNO), a machine learning (ML) model inspired by recent advances in neural operator learning. U-AFNO employs U-Nets for extracting and reconstructing local features within the physical fields, and passes the latent space through a vision transformer (ViT) implemented in the Fourier space (AFNO). We use U-AFNOs to learn the dynamics mapping the field at a current time step into a later time step. We also identify global quantities of interest (QoI) describing the corrosion process (e.g. the deformation of the liquid-metal interface) and show that our proposed U-AFNO model is able to accurately predict the field dynamics, in-spite of the chaotic nature of LMD. Our model reproduces the key micro-structure statistics and QoIs with a level of accuracy on-par with the high-fidelity numerical solver. We also investigate the opportunity of using hybrid simulations, in which we alternate forward leap in time using the U-AFNO with high-fidelity time stepping. We demonstrate that while advantageous for some surrogate model design choices, our proposed U-AFNO model in fully auto-regressive settings consistently outperforms hybrid schemes.">

Training DNNs is posed as an optimization problem to learn network weights or parameters that well-approximate a mapping from input to target data. Multiway data or tensors arise naturally in myriad ways in deep learning, in particular as input data and as high-dimensional weights and features extracted by the network, with the latter often being a bottleneck in terms of speed and memory. In this work, we leverage tensor representations and processing to efficiently parameterize DNNs when learning from high-dimensional data. We propose tensor neural networks (t-NNs), a natural extension of traditional fully-connected networks, that can be trained efficiently in a reduced, yet more powerful parameter space. Our t-NNs are built upon matrix-mimetic tensor-tensor products, which retain algebraic properties of matrix multiplication while capturing high-dimensional correlations. Mimeticity enables t-NNs to inherit desirable properties of modern DNN architectures. We exemplify this by extending recent work on stable neural networks, which interpret DNNs as discretizations of differential equations, to our multidimensional framework. We provide empirical evidence of the parametric advantages of t-NNs on dimensionality reduction using autoencoders and classification using fully-connected and stable variants on benchmark imaging datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10.">

        <tr id="Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others.">

        <tr id="It is a challenging topic in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Standard approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs suffer under the curse of dimensionality (COD) in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation method grows at least exponentially in the PDE dimension and with such methods it is essentially impossible to approximately solve high-dimensional PDEs even when the fastest currently available computers are used. However, in the last years great progress has been made in this area of research through suitable deep learning (DL) based methods for PDEs in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate solutions of PDEs. Despite the remarkable success of such DL methods in simulations, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to prove (or disprove) that such methods can overcome the COD in the approximation of PDEs. However, there are nowadays several partial error analysis results for DL methods for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs in the literature which prove that DNNs can overcome the COD in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ and the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In the main result of this article we prove that for all $T,p\in(0,\infty)$ it holds that solutions $u_d\colon[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, of semilinear heat equations with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated in the $L^p$-sense on space-time regions without the COD by DNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU), the leaky ReLU, or the softplus activation function. In previous articles similar results have been established not for space-time regions but for the solutions $u_d(T,\cdot)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, at the terminal time $T$.">

        <tr id="State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.">

Our data-driven methodology simultaneously approximates the PF operator to perform prediction of the evolution of the agents and also predicts the terminal probability density of AI agents, such as robotic systems and generative models.

        <tr id="A fast solution of supersonic flow is one of the crucial challenges in engineering applications of supersonic flight. This article introduces a deep learning framework, the supersonic physics-constrained network (SPC), for the rapid solution of unsteady supersonic flow problems. SPC integrates deep convolutional neural networks with physics-constrained methods based on the Euler equation to derive a new loss function that can accurately calculate the flow fields by considering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow fields at the previous moment. Compared to purely data-driven methods, SPC significantly reduces the dependency on training data volume by incorporating physical constraints. Additionally, the training process of SPC is more stable than that of data-driven methods. Taking the classic supersonic forward step flow as an example, SPC can accurately calculate strong discontinuities in the flow fields, while reducing the data volume by approximately 60%. In the generalization test experiment for forward step flow and compression ramp flow, SPC also demonstrates good predictive accuracy and generalization capability under different geometric configurations and inflow conditions.">

        <tr id="Model parameter inference is a universal problem across science. This challenge is particularly pronounced in developmental biology, where faithful mechanistic descriptions require spatial-stochastic models with numerous parameters, yet quantitative empirical data often lack sufficient granularity due to experimental limitations. Parameterizing such complex models thus necessitates methods that elaborate on classical Bayesian inference by incorporating notions of optimality and goal-orientation through low-dimensional objective functions that quantitatively capture the target behavior of the underlying system. In this study, we contrast two such inference workflows and apply them to biophysics-inspired spatial-stochastic models. Technically, both workflows are simulation-based inference (SBI) methods. The first method leverages a modern deep-learning technique known as sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), while the second is based on a classical optimization technique called simulated annealing (SA). We evaluate these workflows by inferring the parameters of two complementary models for the inner cell mass (ICM) lineage differentiation in the blastocyst-stage mouse embryo. This developmental biology system serves as a paradigmatic example of a highly robust and reproducible cell-fate proportioning process that self-organizes under strongly stochastic conditions, such as intrinsic biochemical noise and cell-cell signaling delays. Our results indicate that while both methods largely agree in their predictions, the modern SBI workflow provides substantially richer inferred distributions at an equivalent computational cost. We identify the computational scenarios that favor the modern SBI method over its classical counterpart. Finally, we propose a plausible approach to integrate these two methods, thereby synergistically exploiting their parameter space exploration capabilities.">

        <tr id="As deep learning has evolved, larger and deeper neural networks are currently a popular trend in both natural language processing tasks and computer vision tasks. With the increasing parameter size and model complexity in deep neural networks, it is also necessary to have more data available for training to avoid overfitting and to achieve better results. These facts demonstrate that training deep neural networks takes more and more time. In this paper, we propose a training acceleration method based on gradually freezing the parameters during the training process. Specifically, by observing the convergence trend during the training of deep neural networks, we freeze part of the parameters so that they are no longer involved in subsequent training and reduce the time cost of training. Furthermore, an adaptive freezing algorithm for the control of freezing speed is proposed in accordance with the information reflected by the gradient of the parameters. Concretely, a larger gradient indicates that the loss function changes more drastically at that position, implying that there is more room for improvement with the parameter involved; a smaller gradient indicates that the loss function changes less and the learning of that part is close to saturation, with less benefit from further training. We use ViTDet as our baseline and conduct experiments on three remote sensing target detection datasets to verify the effectiveness of the method. Our method provides a minimum speedup ratio of 1.38×, while maintaining a maximum accuracy loss of only 2.5%.">

At first, the proposed model, containing global states in the evolutionary interval, is transformed into an equivalent model with bidirectional memory. This transformation incorporates crucial global state information with support for bi-directional recursive computation. For the transformed model, the joint state-memory-trend Bayesian filtering and smoothing frameworks are derived by introducing the bidirectional memory iteration mechanism and offline data into Bayesian estimation theory. The derived frameworks are implemented using the Gaussian approximation to ensure analytical properties and computational efficiency. Finally, the neural network modules within EBRNS and its two-stage training scheme are designed. Unlike most existing approaches that artificially combine deep learning and model-based estimation, the bidirectional recursion and internal gated structures of EBRNS are naturally derived from Bayesian estimation theory, explainably integrating prior model knowledge, online measurement, and offline data. Experiments on representative real-world datasets demonstrate that the high smoothing accuracy of EBRNS is accompanied by data efficiency and a lightweight parameter scale.">

Numerical differentiation (ND) using the finite difference (FD) method is efficient in physics-constrained designs, even in parameterized settings, often employing body-fitted block-structured grids for complex flow cases. However, convolution operators in CNNs for finite differences are typically limited to single-block grids. To address this, we use graphs and graph networks (GNs) to learn flow representations across multi-block structured grids. We propose a graph convolution-based finite difference method (GC-FDM) to train GNs in a physics-constrained manner, enabling differentiable finite difference operations on graph unstructured outputs. Our goal is to solve parametric steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for flows around a backward-facing step, a circular cylinder, and double cylinders, using multi-block structured grids. Comparing our method to a CFD solver under various boundary conditions, we demonstrate improved training efficiency and accuracy, achieving a minimum relative error of $10^{-3}$ in velocity field prediction and a 20\% reduction in training cost compared to PINNs.">

We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible. While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii). The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.">

        <tr id="The Neural Network Field Theory correspondence (NNFT) is a mapping from neural network (NN) architectures into the space of statistical field theories (SFTs). The Bayesian renormalization group (BRG) is an information-theoretic coarse graining scheme that generalizes the principles of the Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) to arbitrarily parameterized probability distributions, including those of NNs. In BRG, coarse graining is performed in parameter space with respect to an information-theoretic distinguishability scale set by the Fisher information metric. In this paper, we unify NNFT and BRG to form a powerful new framework for exploring the space of NNs and SFTs, which we coin BRG-NNFT. With BRG-NNFT, NN training dynamics can be interpreted as inducing a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `IR' $\rightarrow$ `UV'. Conversely, applying an information-shell coarse graining to the trained network's parameters induces a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `UV' $\rightarrow$ `IR'. When the information-theoretic cutoff scale coincides with a standard momentum scale, BRG is equivalent to ERG. We demonstrate the BRG-NNFT correspondence on two analytically tractable examples. First, we construct BRG flows for trained, infinite-width NNs, of arbitrary depth, with generic activation functions. As a special case, we then restrict to architectures with a single infinitely-wide layer, scalar outputs, and generalized cos-net activations. In this case, we show that BRG coarse-graining corresponds exactly to the momentum-shell ERG flow of a free scalar SFT. Our analytic results are corroborated by a numerical experiment in which an ensemble of asymptotically wide NNs are trained and subsequently renormalized using an information-shell BRG scheme.">

        <tr id="Despite the advancements in learning governing differential equations from observations of dynamical systems, data-driven methods are often unaware of fundamental physical laws, such as frame invariance. As a result, these algorithms may search an unnecessarily large space and discover equations that are less accurate or overly complex. In this paper, we propose to leverage symmetry in automated equation discovery to compress the equation search space and improve the accuracy and simplicity of the learned equations. Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming. In experiments across a diverse range of dynamical systems, our approach demonstrates better robustness against noise and recovers governing equations with significantly higher probability than baselines without symmetry.">

While sophisticated DNNs offer an impressive generalization, it is imperative to comprehend the quality, confidence, robustness, and uncertainty associated with their prediction. A thorough understanding of these quantities produces actionable insights that help application scientists make informed decisions. Unfortunately, the intrinsic design principles of the DNNs cannot beget prediction uncertainty, necessitating separate formulations for robust uncertainty-aware models for diverse visualization applications. To that end, this contribution demonstrates how the prediction uncertainty and sensitivity of DNNs can be estimated efficiently using various methods and then interactively compared and contrasted for deep image synthesis tasks. Our inspection suggests that uncertainty-aware deep visualization models generate illustrations of informative and superior quality and diversity. Furthermore, prediction uncertainty improves the robustness and interpretability of deep visualization models, making them practical and convenient for various scientific domains that thrive on visual analyses.">

The three desired properties of a general Equation of State model are adherence to the Laws of Thermodynamics, incorporation of phase transitions, and multiscale accuracy. Analytic models that adhere to all three are hard to develop and cumbersome to work with, often resulting in sacrificing one of these elements for the sake of efficiency. In this work, two deep-learning methods are proposed that provably satisfy the first and second conditions on a large-enough region of thermodynamic variable space. The first is based on learning the generating function (thermodynamic potential) while the second is based on structure-preserving, symplectic neural networks, respectively allowing modifications near or on phase transition regions. They can be used either"from scratch"to learn a full Equation of State, or in conjunction with a pre-existing consistent model, functioning as a modification that better adheres to experimental data. We formulate the theory and provide several computational examples to justify both approaches, and highlight their advantages and shortcomings.">

Leveraging recent analytical progress in the proportional regime of deep learning theory (i.e. the limit where the size of the training set $P$ and the size of the hidden layers $N$ are taken to infinity keeping their ratio $\alpha = P/N$ finite), in this work we develop a novel single-instance Franz-Parisi formalism that yields an effective theory for TL in fully-connected neural networks.

 We present a variational approach aimed at enhancing the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and more general surrogate models for learning partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we extend our formerly introduced notion of Sobolev cubatures to negative orders, enabling the approximation of negative order Sobolev norms. We mathematically prove the effect of negative order Sobolev cubatures in improving the condition number of discrete PDE learning problems, providing balancing scalars that mitigate numerical stiffness issues caused by loss imbalances. Additionally, we consider polynomial surrogate models (PSMs), which maintain the flexibility of PINN formulations while preserving the convexity structure of the PDE operators. The combination of negative order Sobolev cubatures and PSMs delivers well-conditioned discrete optimization problems, solvable via an exponentially fast convergent gradient descent for λ-convex losses. Our theoretical contributions are supported by numerical experiments, addressing linear and non-linear, forward and inverse PDE problems. These experiments show that the Sobolev cubature-based PSMs emerge as the superior state-of-the-art PINN technique.">

        <tr id="Pretraining for partial differential equation (PDE) modeling has recently shown promise in scaling neural operators across datasets to improve generalizability and performance. Despite these advances, our understanding of how pretraining affects neural operators is still limited; studies generally propose tailored architectures and datasets that make it challenging to compare or examine different pretraining frameworks. To address this, we compare various pretraining methods without optimizing architecture choices to characterize pretraining dynamics on different models and datasets as well as to understand its scaling and generalization behavior. We find that pretraining is highly dependent on model and dataset choices, but in general transfer learning or physics-based pretraining strategies work best. In addition, pretraining performance can be further improved by using data augmentations. Lastly, pretraining is additionally beneficial when fine-tuning in scarce data regimes or when generalizing to downstream data similar to the pretraining distribution. Through providing insights into pretraining neural operators for physics prediction, we hope to motivate future work in developing and evaluating pretraining methods for PDEs.">

        <tr id="Deep learning algorithms - typically consisting of a class of deep neural networks trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays the key ingredients in many artificial intelligence (AI) systems and have revolutionized our ways of working and living in modern societies. For example, SGD methods are used to train powerful large language models (LLMs) such as versions of ChatGPT and Gemini, SGD methods are employed to create successful generative AI based text-to-image creation models such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, but SGD methods are also used to train DNNs to approximately solve scientific models such as partial differential equation (PDE) models from physics and biology and optimal control and stopping problems from engineering. It is known that the plain vanilla standard SGD method fails to converge even in the situation of several convex optimization problems if the learning rates are bounded away from zero. However, in many practical relevant training scenarios, often not the plain vanilla standard SGD method but instead adaptive SGD methods such as the RMSprop and the Adam optimizers, in which the learning rates are modified adaptively during the training process, are employed. This naturally rises the question whether such adaptive optimizers, in which the learning rates are modified adaptively during the training process, do converge in the situation of non-vanishing learning rates. In this work we answer this question negatively by proving that adaptive SGD methods such as the popular Adam optimizer fail to converge to any possible random limit point if the learning rates are asymptotically bounded away from zero. In our proof of this non-convergence result we establish suitable pathwise a priori bounds for a class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods, which are also of independent interest.">

It is often necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying base distribution. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving PDEs under new parameter regimes.">

More specifically, by replacing the standard KL divergence with the R\'enyi divergence between the posterior and the approximated prior, we ameliorate the impact of the misspecified prior via a parameter {\alpha} so that the resulting posterior focuses more on tail samples and reduce density on overconfident regions. Our experiments showed log-likelihood improvements on several existing NP families.

Since then, variational calculus has developed intensively as many problems in physics and engineering are described by equations from this branch of mathematical analysis.

The first method is based on the differential transform method (DTM), which seeks an analytical solution in the form of a certain functional series. The second method, on the other hand, is based on the physics-informed neural network (PINN), where artificial intelligence in the form of a neural network is used to solve the differential equation. In addition to describing both methods, this paper also presents numerical examples along with a comparison of the obtained results.Comparingthe two methods, DTM produced marginally more accurate results than PINNs. While PINNs exhibited slightly higher errors, their performance remained commendable. The key strengths of neural networks are their adaptability and ease of implementation.

        <tr id="When neural networks are trained from data to simulate the dynamics of physical systems, they encounter a persistent challenge: the long-time dynamics they produce are often unphysical or unstable. We analyze the origin of such instabilities when learning linear dynamical systems, focusing on the training dynamics. We make several analytical findings which empirical observations suggest extend to nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.">

        <tr id="Interpretable mathematical expressions defining discrete-time dynamical systems (iterated maps) can model many phenomena of scientific interest, enabling a deeper understanding of system behaviors. Since formulating governing expressions from first principles can be difficult, it is of particular interest to identify expressions for iterated maps given only their data streams. In this work, we consider a modified Symbolic Artificial Neural Network-Trained Expressions (SymANNTEx) architecture for this task, an architecture more expressive than others in the literature. We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented. We show that our modified SymANNTEx model properly identifies single-state maps and achieves moderate success in approximating a dual-state attractor. These performances offer significant promise for data-driven scientific discovery and interpretation.">

        <tr id="We show at a physics level of rigor that Bayesian inference with a fully connected neural network and a shaped nonlinearity of the form $\phi(t) = t + \psi t^3/L$ is (perturbatively) solvable in the regime where the number of training datapoints $P$ , the input dimension $N_0$, the network layer widths $N$, and the network depth $L$ are simultaneously large. Our results hold with weak assumptions on the data; the main constraint is that $P<N_0$. We provide techniques to compute the model evidence and posterior to arbitrary order in $1/N$ and at arbitrary temperature. We report the following results from the first-order computation: 1. When the width $N$ is much larger than the depth $L$ and training set size $P$, neural network Bayesian inference coincides with Bayesian inference using a kernel. The value of $\psi$ determines the curvature of a sphere, hyperbola, or plane into which the training data is implicitly embedded under the feature map. 2. When $LP/N$ is a small constant, neural network Bayesian inference departs from the kernel regime. At zero temperature, neural network Bayesian inference is equivalent to Bayesian inference using a data-dependent kernel, and $LP/N$ serves as an effective depth that controls the extent of feature learning. 3. In the restricted case of deep linear networks ($\psi=0$) and noisy data, we show a simple data model for which evidence and generalization error are optimal at zero temperature. As $LP/N$ increases, both evidence and generalization further improve, demonstrating the benefit of depth in benign overfitting.">

While the state-of-the-art for evaluating these quantities is almost always based on Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, the present work is the first to explain how to differentiate these workhorses of numerical linear algebra efficiently. To get there, we derive previously unknown adjoint systems for Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, implement them in JAX, and show that the resulting code can compete with Diffrax when it comes to differentiating PDEs, GPyTorch for selecting Gaussian process models and beats standard factorisation methods for calibrating Bayesian neural networks. All this is achieved without any problem-specific code optimisation. Find the code at https://github.com/pnkraemer/experiments-lanczos-adjoints and install the library with pip install matfree.">

Our key insight is to use latent features drawn from a learnable prior distribution conditioned on the underlying particle states to capture the invisible and complex physical properties. To achieve this, we train a parametrized prior learner given visual observations to approximate the visual posterior of inverse graphics, and both the particle states and the visual posterior are obtained from a learned neural renderer. The converged prior learner is embedded in our probabilistic physics engine, allowing us to perform novel simulations on unseen geometries, boundaries, and dynamics without knowledge of the true physical parameters. We validate our model in three ways: (i) novel scene simulation with the learned visual-world physics, (ii) future prediction of the observed fluid dynamics, and (iii) supervised particle simulation. Our model demonstrates strong performance in all three tasks.">

        <tr id="In this study, we introduce a unified neural network architecture, the Deep Equilibrium Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian (DEQH) model, which incorporates Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) for predicting Density Functional Theory (DFT) Hamiltonians. The DEQH model inherently captures the self-consistency nature of Hamiltonian, a critical aspect often overlooked by traditional machine learning approaches for Hamiltonian prediction. By employing DEQ within our model architecture, we circumvent the need for DFT calculations during the training phase to introduce the Hamiltonian's self-consistency, thus addressing computational bottlenecks associated with large or complex systems. We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian. Ablation studies of DEQHNet further elucidate the network's effectiveness, offering insights into the potential of DEQ-integrated networks for Hamiltonian learning.">

The generalized NLS equation demonstrates nonlinear effects up to quintic order, indicating rich and complex dynamics in various fields of physics. By combining concepts from the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Theory-Guided Neural Network (TgNN) models, SCTgNN aims to enhance our understanding of complex phenomena, particularly within nonlinear systems that defy conventional patterns. To begin, we employ the TgNN method to predict the behaviours of localized waves, including solitons, rogue waves, and breathers, within the generalized NLS equation. We then use SCTgNN to predict the aforementioned localized solutions and calculate the mean square errors in both SCTgNN and TgNN in predicting these three localized solutions. Our findings reveal that both models excel in understanding complex behaviours and provide predictions across a wide variety of situations.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models excel at creating visually-convincing images, but they often struggle to meet subtle constraints inherent in the training data. Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model not only improves its distribution-matching accuracy but also makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are inflexible with different types of constraints. Recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs) in an unconstrained space defined by a mirror map and to impose the constraint with an inverse mirror map, but analytical mirror maps are challenging to derive for complex constraints. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that pushes data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.">

        <tr id="Bayesian neural networks address epistemic uncertainty by learning a posterior distribution over model parameters. Sampling and weighting networks according to this posterior yields an ensemble model referred to as Bayes ensemble. Ensembles of neural networks (deep ensembles) can profit from the cancellation of errors effect: Errors by ensemble members may average out and the deep ensemble achieves better predictive performance than each individual network. We argue that neither the sampling nor the weighting in a Bayes ensemble are particularly well-suited for increasing generalization performance, as they do not support the cancellation of errors effect, which is evident in the limit from the Bernstein-von~Mises theorem for misspecified models. In contrast, a weighted average of models where the weights are optimized by minimizing a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound can improve generalization performance. This requires that the optimization takes correlations between models into account, which can be achieved by minimizing the tandem loss at the cost that hold-out data for estimating error correlations need to be available. The PAC-Bayesian weighting increases the robustness against correlated models and models with lower performance in an ensemble. This allows us to safely add several models from the same learning process to an ensemble, instead of using early-stopping for selecting a single weight configuration. Our study presents empirical results supporting these conceptual considerations on four different classification datasets. We show that state-of-the-art Bayes ensembles from the literature, despite being computationally demanding, do not improve over simple uniformly weighted deep ensembles and cannot match the performance of deep ensembles weighted by optimizing the tandem loss, which additionally come with non-vacuous generalization guarantees.">

The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks.

        <tr id="We introduce a machine learning (ML) supervised model function that is inspired by the variational principle of physics. This ML hypothesis evolutionary method, termed ML-Omega, allows us to go from data to differential equation(s) underlying the physical (chemical, engineering, etc.) phenomena the data are derived from. The fundamental equations of physics can be derived from this ML-Omega evolutionary method when provided the proper training data. By training the ML-Omega model function with only three hydrogen-like atom energies, the method can find Schr\"odinger's exact functional and, from it, Schr\"odinger's fundamental equation. Then, in the field of density functional theory (DFT), when the model function is trained with the energies from the known Thomas-Fermi (TF) formula E = -0.7687Z^7/3, it correctly finds the exact TF functional. Finally, the method is applied to find a local orbital-free (OF) functional expression of the independent electron kinetic energy functional Ts based on the gamma-TF-lambda-vW model. By considering the theoretical energies of only 5 atoms (He, Be, Ne, Mg, Ar) as the training set, the evolutionary ML-Omega method finds an ML-Omega-OF-DFT local Ts functional (gamma-TF-lambda-vW (0.964, 1/4)) that outperforms all the OF- DFT functionals of a representative group. Moreover, our ML-Omega-OF functional overcomes the LDA's and some local GGA-DFT's functionals' difficulty to describe the stretched bond region at the correct spin configuration of diatomic molecules. Although our evolutionary ML-Omega model function can work without an explicit prior-form functional, by using the techniques of symbolic regression, in this work we exploit prior-form functional expressions to make the training process faster in the example problems presented here.">

Efficient training of the network parameters occurs through two distinct approaches.

        <tr id="Pretrained diffusion models (DMs) have recently been popularly used in solving inverse problems (IPs). The existing methods mostly interleave iterative steps in the reverse diffusion process and iterative steps to bring the iterates closer to satisfying the measurement constraint. However, such interleaving methods struggle to produce final results that look like natural objects of interest (i.e., manifold feasibility) and fit the measurement (i.e., measurement feasibility), especially for nonlinear IPs. Moreover, their capabilities to deal with noisy IPs with unknown types and levels of measurement noise are unknown. In this paper, we advocate viewing the reverse process in DMs as a function and propose a novel plug-in method for solving IPs using pretrained DMs, dubbed DMPlug. DMPlug addresses the issues of manifold feasibility and measurement feasibility in a principled manner, and also shows great potential for being robust to unknown types and levels of noise. Through extensive experiments across various IP tasks, including two linear and three nonlinear IPs, we demonstrate that DMPlug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins especially for nonlinear IPs.

        <tr id="Machine learning (ML) models for predicting gas permeability through polymers have traditionally relied on experimental data. While these models exhibit robustness within familiar chemical domains, reliability wanes when applied to new spaces. To address this challenge, we present a multi-tiered multi-task learning framework empowered with advanced machine-crafted polymer fingerprinting algorithms and data fusion techniques. This framework combines scarce"high-fidelity"experimental data with abundant diverse"low-fidelity"simulation or synthetic data, resulting in predictive models that display a high level of generalizability across novel chemical spaces. Additionally, this multi-task scheme capitalizes on known physics and interrelated properties, such as gas diffusivity and solubility, both of which are closely tied to permeability. By amalgamating high-throughput generated simulation data with available experimental data for gas permeability, diffusivity, and solubility for various gases, we construct multi-task deep learning models. These models can simultaneously predict all three properties for all gases under consideration. With markedly enhanced predictive accuracy, particularly compared to traditional models reliant solely on experimental data for a singular property. This strategy underscores the potential of coupling high-throughput classical simulations with data fusion methodologies to yield state-of-the-art property predictors, especially when experimental data for targeted properties is scarce.">

        <tr id="The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, which is important in photonic hardware design flow, is widely adopted to solve time-domain Maxwell equations. However, FDTD is known for its prohibitive runtime cost, taking minutes to hours to simulate a single device. Recently, AI has been applied to realize orders-of-magnitude speedup in partial differential equation (PDE) solving. However, AI-based FDTD solvers for photonic devices have not been clearly formulated. Directly applying off-the-shelf models to predict the optical field dynamics shows unsatisfying fidelity and efficiency since the model primitives are agnostic to the unique physical properties of Maxwell equations and lack algorithmic customization. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the synergy between neural operator designs and the physical property of Maxwell equations and introduce a physics-inspired AI-based FDTD prediction framework PIC2O-Sim which features a causality-aware dynamic convolutional neural operator as its backbone model that honors the space-time causality constraints via careful receptive field configuration and explicitly captures the permittivity-dependent light propagation behavior via an efficient dynamic convolution operator. Meanwhile, we explore the trade-offs among prediction scalability, fidelity, and efficiency via a multi-stage partitioned time-bundling technique in autoregressive prediction. Multiple key techniques have been introduced to mitigate iterative error accumulation while maintaining efficiency advantages during autoregressive field prediction. Extensive evaluations on three challenging photonic device simulation tasks have shown the superiority of our PIC2O-Sim method, showing 51.2% lower roll-out prediction error, 23.5 times fewer parameters than state-of-the-art neural operators, providing 300-600x higher simulation speed than an open-source FDTD numerical solver.">

Several works focus on computing or approximating Hessian diagonals, but even this simplification introduces significant additional costs compared to computing a gradient. In the absence of efficient exact computation schemes for Hessian diagonals, we revisit an early approximation scheme proposed by Becker and LeCun (1989, BL89), which has a cost similar to gradients and appears to have been overlooked by the community. We introduce HesScale, an improvement over BL89, which adds negligible extra computation. On small networks, we find that this improvement is of higher quality than all alternatives, even those with theoretical guarantees, such as unbiasedness, while being much cheaper to compute. We use this insight in reinforcement learning problems where small networks are used and demonstrate HesScale in second-order optimization and scaling the step-size parameter. In our experiments, HesScale optimizes faster than existing methods and improves stability through step-size scaling. These findings are promising for scaling second-order methods in larger models in the future.">

Here, an explicit mechanical neuron is developed of which the response can be directly determined without the need of solving equilibrium equations. A training method is proposed to ensure the robustness of the neuron, i.e., insensitivity to defects and perturbations. The explicitness and robustness of the neurons facilitate the assembly of various network structures.

A neural network (NN) incorporating uncertainty quantification is trained to predict the number of hot electrons generated by the laser–target interaction as a function of pulse shaping parameters. The predictions of this NN serve as the basis function for a Bayesian optimization framework to navigate this space. For post-experimental evaluation, we compare two separate neural network (NN) models. One is based solely on data from experiments, and the other is trained only on ensemble particle-in-cell simulations. Reviewing the predicted and observed trends across the experiment-capable laser parameter search space, we find that both ML models predict a maximal increase in hot electron generation at a level of approximately 12%–18%; however, no statistically significant enhancement was observed in experiments. On direct comparison of the NN models, the average discrepancy is 8.5%, with a maximum of 30%. Since shot-to-shot fluctuations in experiments affect the observations, we evaluate the behavior of our optimization framework by performing virtual experiments that vary the number of repeated observations and the noise levels. Here, we discuss the implications of such a framework for future autonomous exploration platforms in high-repetition-rate experiments.">

        <tr id="Symmetry is one of the most central concepts in physics, and it is no surprise that it has also been widely adopted as an inductive bias for machine-learning models applied to the physical sciences. This is especially true for models targeting the properties of matter at the atomic scale. Both established and state-of-the-art approaches, with almost no exceptions, are built to be exactly equivariant to translations, permutations, and rotations of the atoms. Incorporating symmetries -- rotations in particular -- constrains the model design space and implies more complicated architectures that are often also computationally demanding. There are indications that non-symmetric models can easily learn symmetries from data, and that doing so can even be beneficial for the accuracy of the model. We put a model that obeys rotational invariance only approximately to the test, in realistic scenarios involving simulations of gas-phase, liquid, and solid water. We focus specifically on physical observables that are likely to be affected -- directly or indirectly -- by symmetry breaking, finding negligible consequences when the model is used in an interpolative, bulk, regime. Even for extrapolative gas-phase predictions, the model remains very stable, even though symmetry artifacts are noticeable. We also discuss strategies that can be used to systematically reduce the magnitude of symmetry breaking when it occurs, and assess their impact on the convergence of observables.">

Yet, data-driven DLO dynamics models require large training data sets while their predictions often do not generalize, whereas physics-based models rely on good approximations of physical phenomena and often lack accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed neural ODE capable of predicting agile movements with significantly less data and hyper-parameter tuning. In particular, we model DLOs as serial chains of rigid bodies interconnected by passive elastic joints in which interaction forces are predicted by neural networks.

In this approach, field data, which are determined by corresponding control vectors, are fitted by a selected B-spline function set, yielding the corresponding best-fitting weight vectors, and then a fully connected neural network is trained using those weight vectors and control vectors. The trained neural network first predicts a weight vector using a given control vector, and then the corresponding field can be restored via the selected B-spline set. This method was applied to learn and predict two-dimensional steady advection–diffusion physical fields with absorption and source terms, and its accuracy and performance were tested and verified by a series of numerical experiments with different B-spline sets, boundary conditions, field gradients, and field states. The proposed method was finally compared with a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The results indicated that the B-spline neural network could predict the tested physical fields well; the overall error can be reduced by expanding the selected B-spline set.

        <tr id="Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have become a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships in large-scale datasets. However, their black-box nature poses ethical challenges. In certain situations, ensuring ethical predictions might require following specific partial monotonic constraints. However, certifying if an already-trained ANN is partially monotonic is challenging. Therefore, ANNs are often disregarded in some critical applications, such as credit scoring, where partial monotonicity is required. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel algorithm (LipVor) that certifies if a black-box model, such as an ANN, is positive based on a finite number of evaluations. Therefore, as partial monotonicity can be stated as a positivity condition of the partial derivatives, the LipVor Algorithm can certify whether an already trained ANN is partially monotonic. To do so, for every positively evaluated point, the Lipschitzianity of the black-box model is used to construct a specific neighborhood where the function remains positive. Next, based on the Voronoi diagram of the evaluated points, a sufficient condition is stated to certify if the function is positive in the domain. Compared to prior methods, our approach is able to mathematically certify if an ANN is partially monotonic without needing constrained ANN's architectures or piece-wise linear activation functions. Therefore, LipVor could open up the possibility of using unconstrained ANN in some critical fields. Moreover, some other properties of an ANN, such as convexity, can be posed as positivity conditions, and therefore, LipVor could also be applied.">

Recent advances in machine learning provide data-driven methods for developing digital twins using discrete-time data and finite-depth models on digital computers. However, this approach fails to capture the underlying continuous dynamics and struggles with modelling complex system behaviour. Additionally, the architecture of digital computers, with separate storage and processing units, necessitates frequent data transfers and Analogue-Digital (A/D) conversion, thereby significantly increasing both time and energy costs. Here, we introduce a memristive neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for digital twins, which is capable of capturing continuous-time dynamics and facilitates the modelling of complex systems using an infinite-depth model. By integrating storage and computation within analogue memristor arrays, we circumvent the von Neumann bottleneck, thus enhancing both speed and energy efficiency. We experimentally validate our approach by developing a digital twin of the HP memristor, which accurately extrapolates its nonlinear dynamics, achieving a 4.2-fold projected speedup and a 41.4-fold projected decrease in energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art digital hardware, while maintaining an acceptable error margin. Additionally, we demonstrate scalability through experimentally grounded simulations of Lorenz96 dynamics, exhibiting projected performance improvements of 12.6-fold in speed and 189.7-fold in energy efficiency relative to traditional digital approaches. By harnessing the capabilities of fully analogue computing, our breakthrough accelerates the development of digital twins, offering an efficient and rapid solution to meet the demands of Industry 4.0.">

        <tr id="The recent emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced the precision of learnable priors, presenting innovative avenues for addressing inverse problems. Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

        <tr id="In this paper, we present a new framework how a PDE with constraints can be formulated into a sequence of PDEs with no constraints, whose solutions are convergent to the solution of the PDE with constraints. This framework is then used to build a novel finite neuron method to solve the 2nd order elliptic equations with the Dirichlet boundary condition. Our algorithm is the first algorithm, proven to lead to shallow neural network solutions with an optimal H1 norm error. We show that a widely used penalized PDE, which imposes the Dirichlet boundary condition weakly can be interpreted as the first element of the sequence of PDEs within our framework. Furthermore, numerically, we show that it may not lead to the solution with the optimal H1 norm error bound in general. On the other hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the second and later elements of a sequence of PDEs can lead to an adequate solution with the optimal H1 norm error bound. A number of sample tests are performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the relevant theory.">

        <tr id="This paper expands the damped block Newton (dBN) method introduced recently in [4] for 1D diffusion-reaction equations and least-squares data fitting problems. To determine the linear parameters (the weights and bias of the output layer) of the neural network (NN), the dBN method requires solving systems of linear equations involving the mass matrix. While the mass matrix for local hat basis functions is tri-diagonal and well-conditioned, the mass matrix for NNs is dense and ill-conditioned. For example, the condition number of the NN mass matrix for quasi-uniform meshes is at least ${\cal O}(n^4)$. We present a factorization of the mass matrix that enables solving the systems of linear equations in ${\cal O}(n)$ operations. To determine the non-linear parameters (the weights and bias of the hidden layer), one step of a damped Newton method is employed at each iteration. A Gauss-Newton method is used in place of Newton for the instances in which the Hessian matrices are singular. This modified dBN is referred to as dBGN. For both methods, the computational cost per iteration is ${\cal O}(n)$. Numerical results demonstrate the ability dBN and dBGN to efficiently achieve accurate results and outperform BFGS for select examples.">

        <tr id="While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature learning only occurs with balanced initializations, where all layers learn at similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced initializations to enhance efficient feature learning.">

        <tr id="For decades, solutions to regional scale landslide prediction have mostly relied on data-driven models, by definition, disconnected from the physics of the failure mechanism. The success and spread of such tools came from the ability to exploit proxy variables rather than explicit geotechnical ones, as the latter are prohibitive to acquire over broad landscapes. Our work implements a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach, thereby adding to a standard data-driven architecture, an intermediate constraint to solve for the permanent deformation typical of Newmark slope stability methods. This translates into a neural network tasked with explicitly retrieving geotechnical parameters from common proxy variables and then minimize a loss function with respect to the available coseismic landside inventory. The results are very promising, because our model not only produces excellent predictive performance in the form of standard susceptibility output, but in the process, also generates maps of the expected geotechnical properties at a regional scale. Such architecture is therefore framed to tackle coseismic landslide prediction, something that, if confirmed in other studies, could open up towards PINN-based near-real-time predictions.">

In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.">

When there are time delays for components to sense and respond to feedback, delay differential equation (DDE) models are commonly used. This paper considers the problem of inferring unknown system parameters, including the time delays, from noisy and sparse experimental data observed from the system. We propose an extension of manifold-constrained Gaussian processes to conduct parameter inference for DDEs, whereas the time delay parameters have posed a challenge for existing methods that bypass numerical solvers. Our method uses a Bayesian framework to impose a Gaussian process model over the system trajectory, conditioned on the manifold constraint that satisfies the DDEs. For efficient computation, a linear interpolation scheme is developed to approximate the values of the time-delayed system outputs, along with corresponding theoretical error bounds on the approximated derivatives. Two simulation examples, based on Hutchinson's equation and the lac operon system, together with a real-world application using Ontario COVID-19 data, are used to illustrate the efficacy of our method.">

Traditionally, in addressing time-dependent nonlinear problems, attention has been on low-order finite difference schemes for time discretization and spectral element schemes for spatial variables. However, our recent developments have resulted in the application of spectral methods to both space and time variables, preserving spectral convergence in both domains. Leveraging Tensor Train techniques, our approach tackles the curse of dimensionality inherent in space-time methods. Here, we extend this methodology to the nonlinear time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our discretization scheme exhibits a low-rank structure, facilitating translation to tensor-train (TT) format. Nevertheless, controlling the TT-rank across Newton's iterations, needed to deal with the nonlinearity, poses a challenge, leading us to devise the"Step Truncation TT-Newton"method. We demonstrate the exponential convergence of our methods through various benchmark examples. Importantly, our scheme offers significantly reduced memory requirement compared to the full-grid scheme.">

It then demonstrates that a prediction problem modeled through an RNN, with a specific regularization term in the loss function, can have its first-order conditions expressed analytically. This system of equations is reduced to two matrix equations involving Sylvester equations, which can be partially solved. We establish that, if certain conditions are met, optimal parameters exist, are unique, and can be found through a straightforward algorithm to any desired precision. Also, as the number of neurons grows the conditions of convergence become easier to fulfill. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are also explored by including linear constraints on parameters. According to our model, incorporating loops (with fixed or variable weights) will produce loss functions that train easier, because it assures the existence of a region where an iterative method converges.">

Thus, it can explore globally and identify near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method in 1D Burgers' equation and 2D jellyfish movement control in a fluid environment.

While most works so far need a form of model selection built-in within the prior distribution, a key aspect of our approach is that it does not require to sample hyperparameters to learn the architecture of the network.

We propose three methods, namely evolutive culling, a repair mechanism, and a multi-objective approach, to integrate the dimensional analysis in the GP algorithm. Experiments on datasets with ground truth demonstrate comparable performance of evolutive culling and the multi-objective approach to a baseline without dimensional analysis. Extensive analysis of the results on datasets without ground truth reveals that the unit-aware algorithms make only low sacrifices in accuracy, while producing unit-adherent solutions.

Rapidly and accurately predicting unsteady flow fields has been a major challenge in fluid mechanics. Therefore, we designed a new U-shaped hybrid deep neural network (UDNN) framework using a multilayer convolution. Through the multilayer learning interaction of high-dimensional flow-field data, the temporal and spatial characteristics of the flow-field flow are captured, and the flow-field characteristics are predicted in an end-to-end form. The UDNN comprises a convolutional neural layer, deconvolutional layer, convolutional long-term and short-term layers, and attention-mechanism layer. First, based on computational fluid dynamics, we generated unsteady flow-field datasets of the flow around fixed and rotating cylinders at different Reynolds numbers, which were used as training samples for the network framework. Second, we designed a U-shaped convolutional layer, added horizontal time-series feature processing and attention-mechanism units, and fused the deep feature information predicted by the model with shallow semantic information to predict the flow-field features. In addition, we compared the UDNN, proper orthogonal decomposition – long short-term memory, and traditional convolutional autoencoder – long short-term memory models in terms of the flow-field prediction error, model training time, and inference speed. The final results showed that the proposed UDNN framework achieved high accuracy and strong robustness in predicting unsteady flow fields.">

For a wavepacket propagating in an anharmonic potential and for a tunneling system, we show that the FNO approach can accurately and faithfully model wavepacket propagation via the density. Additionally, we demonstrate that FNOs can be a suitable replacement for traditional TDSE solvers in cases where the results of the quantum dynamical simulation are required repeatedly such as in the case of parameter optimization problems (e.g., control). The speed‐up from the FNO method allows for its combination with the Markov‐chain Monte Carlo approach in applications that involve solving inverse problems such as optimal and coherent laser control of the outcome of dynamical processes.">

        <tr id="In this work, we propose a set of physics-informed geometric operators (GOs) to enrich the geometric data provided for training surrogate/discriminative models, dimension reduction, and generative models, typically employed for performance prediction, dimension reduction, and creating data-driven parameterisations, respectively. However, as both the input and output streams of these models consist of low-level shape representations, they often fail to capture shape characteristics essential for performance analyses. Therefore, the proposed GOs exploit the differential and integral properties of shapes--accessed through Fourier descriptors, curvature integrals, geometric moments, and their invariants--to infuse high-level intrinsic geometric information and physics into the feature vector used for training, even when employing simple model architectures or low-level parametric descriptions. We showed that for surrogate modelling, along with the inclusion of the notion of physics, GOs enact regularisation to reduce over-fitting and enhance generalisation to new, unseen designs. Furthermore, through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that for dimension reduction and generative models, incorporating the proposed GOs enriches the training data with compact global and local geometric features. This significantly enhances the quality of the resulting latent space, thereby facilitating the generation of valid and diverse designs. Lastly, we also show that GOs can enable learning parametric sensitivities to a great extent. Consequently, these enhancements accelerate the convergence rate of shape optimisers towards optimal solutions.">

        <tr id="The effective inclusion of a priori knowledge when embedding known data in physics‐based models of dynamical systems can ensure that the reconstructed model respects physical principles, while simultaneously improving the accuracy of the solution in the previously unseen regions of state space. This paper presents a physics‐constrained data‐driven discrepancy modeling method that variationally embeds known data in the modeling framework. The hierarchical structure of the method yields fine scale variational equations that facilitate the derivation of residuals which are comprised of the first‐principles theory and sensor‐based data from the dynamical system. The embedding of the sensor data via residual terms leads to discrepancy‐informed closure models that yield a method which is driven not only by boundary and initial conditions, but also by measurements that are taken at only a few observation points in the target system. Specifically, the data‐embedding term serves as residual‐based least‐squares loss function, thus retaining variational consistency. Another important relation arises from the interpretation of the stabilization tensor as a kernel function, thereby incorporating a priori knowledge of the problem and adding computational intelligence to the modeling framework. Numerical test cases show that when known data is taken into account, the data driven variational (DDV) method can correctly predict the system response in the presence of several types of discrepancies. Specifically, the damped solution and correct energy time histories are recovered by including known data in the undamped situation. Morlet wavelet analyses reveal that the surrogate problem with embedded data recovers the fundamental frequency band of the target system. The enhanced stability and accuracy of the DDV method is manifested via reconstructed displacement and velocity fields that yield time histories of strain and kinetic energies which match the target systems. The proposed DDV method also serves as a procedure for restoring eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a deficient dynamical system when known data is taken into account, as shown in the numerical test cases presented here.">

This has increased the importance of automatic methods for extracting significant features to understand physical phenomena. Traditional techniques like the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) have been widely used for this purpose. However, recent advancements in computational power have allowed for the development of data-driven modal reduction approaches. This paper discusses four applications of deep neural networks for aerodynamic applications, including a convolutional neural network autoencoder, to analyze unsteady flow fields around a circular cylinder at Re = 100 and a supersonic boundary layer with Tollmien–Schlichting waves. The autoencoder results are comparable to those obtained with POD and spectral POD. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the autoencoder can compress steady hypersonic boundary-layer profiles into a low-dimensional vector space that is spanned by the pressure gradient and wall-temperature ratio. This paper also proposes a convolutional neural network model to estimate velocity and temperature profiles across different hypersonic flow conditions.">

        <tr id="Analog circuit design requires substantial human expertise and involvement, which is a significant roadblock to design productivity. Bayesian Optimization (BO), a popular machine learning based optimization strategy, has been leveraged to automate analog design given its applicability across various circuit topologies and technologies. Traditional BO methods employ black box Gaussian Process surrogate models and optimized labeled data queries to find optimization solutions by trading off between exploration and exploitation. However, the search for the optimal design solution in BO can be expensive from both a computational and data usage point of view, particularly for high dimensional optimization problems. This paper presents ADO-LLM, the first work integrating large language models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization for analog design optimization. ADO-LLM leverages the LLM's ability to infuse domain knowledge to rapidly generate viable design points to remedy BO's inefficiency in finding high value design areas specifically under the limited design space coverage of the BO's probabilistic surrogate model. In the meantime, sampling of design points evaluated in the iterative BO process provides quality demonstrations for the LLM to generate high quality design points while leveraging infused broad design knowledge. Furthermore, the diversity brought by BO's exploration enriches the contextual understanding of the LLM and allows it to more broadly search in the design space and prevent repetitive and redundant suggestions. We evaluate the proposed framework on two different types of analog circuits and demonstrate notable improvements in design efficiency and effectiveness.">

        <tr id="For partial differential equations on domains of arbitrary shapes, existing works of neural operators attempt to learn a mapping from geometries to solutions. It often requires a large dataset of geometry-solution pairs in order to obtain a sufficiently accurate neural operator. However, for many industrial applications, e.g., engineering design optimization, it can be prohibitive to satisfy the requirement since even a single simulation may take hours or days of computation. To address this issue, we propose reference neural operators (RNO), a novel way of implementing neural operators, i.e., to learn the smooth dependence of solutions on geometric deformations. Specifically, given a reference solution, RNO can predict solutions corresponding to arbitrary deformations of the referred geometry. This approach turns out to be much more data efficient. Through extensive experiments, we show that RNO can learn the dependence across various types and different numbers of geometry objects with relatively small datasets. RNO outperforms baseline models in accuracy by a large lead and achieves up to 80% error reduction.">

To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and six non-hybrid systems show that our method outperforms previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.">

A significant limitation arises from the need for precise symmetry between connections in the backward and forward pathways to backpropagate gradient signals accurately, which is not observed in biological brains. Researchers have proposed several algorithms to alleviate this symmetry constraint, such as feedback alignment and direct feedback alignment. However, their divergence from backpropagation dynamics presents challenges, particularly in deeper networks and convolutional layers. Here we introduce the Product Feedback Alignment (PFA) algorithm. Our findings demonstrate that PFA closely approximates BP and achieves comparable performance in deep convolutional networks while avoiding explicit weight symmetry.

In this study, we explore the use of deep learning techniques to solve this nonlinear identification problem. We specifically focus on extracting dynamic models of simple deformable objects from the high-dimensional sensor input coming from an RGB camera. We investigate a two-stage approach to achieve this goal. First, we train a variational autoencoder to extract an extremely low-dimensional representation of the object configuration. Then, we learn a dynamic model that predicts the evolution of these latent space variables. The proposed architecture can accurately predict the object's state up to one second into the future.">

However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs.

Nested within this transformative research paradigm, machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies have been extensively harnessed for the analysis of these vast data sets. Within the domain of high-energy nuclear physics, two prevalent machine learning techniques have emerged: Bayesian analysis and deep learning. The former employs comprehensive fitting methodologies that compare extensive data sets against theoretical models, enabling the extraction of critical information pertaining to the initial nuclear structure, parton distributions, the equation of state governing hot and dense nuclear matter, and the transport coefficients of the quark–gluon plasma, among other parameters. Conversely, the latter capitalizes on the unparalleled pattern recognition capabilities of deep learning to discern robust features from high-dimensional raw data, specifically targeting individual physical parameters. This paper elucidates the fundamental principles of machine learning and delineates its potential to augment high-energy nuclear physics research endeavors.">

        <tr id="Coarse-grained models describe the macroscopic mean response of a process at large scales, which derives from stochastic processes at small scales. Common examples include accounting for velocity fluctuations in a turbulent fluid flow model and cloud evolution in climate models. Most existing techniques for constructing coarse-grained models feature ill-defined parameters whose values are arbitrarily chosen (e.g., a window size), are narrow in their applicability (e.g., only applicable to time series or spatial data), or cannot readily incorporate physics information. Here, we introduce the concept of physics-guided Gaussian process regression as a machine-learning-based coarse-graining technique that is broadly applicable and amenable to input from known physics-based relationships. Using a pair of case studies derived from molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the attractive properties and superior performance of physics-guided Gaussian processes for coarse-graining relative to prevalent benchmarks. The key advantage of Gaussian-process-based coarse-graining is its ability to seamlessly integrate data-driven and physics-based information.">

        <tr id="Scientists often model physical processes to understand the natural world and uncover the causation behind observations. Due to unavoidable simplification, discrepancies often arise between model predictions and actual observations, in the form of systematic biases, whose impact varies with model completeness. Classical model inversion methods such as Bayesian inference or regressive neural networks tend either to overlook biases or make assumptions about their nature during data preprocessing, potentially leading to implausible results. Inspired by recent work in inverse graphics, we replace the decoder stage of a standard autoencoder with a physical model followed by a bias-correction layer. This generalisable approach simultaneously inverts the model and corrects its biases in an end-to-end manner without making strong assumptions about the nature of the biases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using two physical models from disparate domains: a complex radiative transfer model from remote sensing; and a volcanic deformation model from geodesy. Our method matches or surpasses results from classical approaches without requiring biases to be explicitly filtered out, suggesting an effective pathway for understanding the causation of various physical processes.">

This versatility eliminates the need for patching and allows efficient processing of diverse geometries. The sequential nature of our latent representation can be interpreted spatially and permits the use of a conditional transformer for modeling the temporal dynamics of PDEs.

However, UQ using established methods ranges from very expensive to prohibitively costly, and estimating noise levels and integrating prior information is challenging, so it is not yet widely undertaken. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of a machine learning-based UQ tool known as the invertible neural network (INN) and focus on its application to a 2D tomography problem within a complex foothills environment. We propose a novel approach to handle realistic problem dimensions that uses variational autoencoders to compress the velocity model and data. The INN relates the respective latent spaces, significantly reducing memory requirements. Our findings reveal that this INN-based workflow can perform tomographic inversion while integrating an implicit prior in the form of a set of velocity models with pertinent features. Furthermore, we can address both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by adopting a deep ensemble strategy. This integrated approach yields plausible estimates of relative confidence in the inverted velocities, showcasing the potential of INN as a tool for UQ in geophysical inversion.">

In computer-aided engineering (CAE), the ability to handle fine resolutions and large computational models is essential for improving product performance and reducing development costs. However, solving large-scale PDEs, particularly for systems with spatially varying material properties, poses significant computational challenges. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving second-order linear PDEs of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters, using the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method. Our approach transforms those PDEs into ordinary differential equations represented by qubit operators, through spatial discretization using the finite difference method. Then, we provide an algorithm that efficiently constructs the operator corresponding to the spatially varying parameters of PDEs via a logic minimization technique, which reduces the number of terms and subsequently the circuit depth. We also develop a scalable method for realizing a quantum circuit for LCHS, using a tensor-network-based technique, specifically a matrix product state (MPS). We validate our method with applications to the acoustic equation with spatially varying parameters and the dissipative heat equation. Our approach includes a detailed recipe for constructing quantum circuits for PDEs, leveraging efficient encoding of spatially varying parameters of PDEs and scalable implementation of LCHS, which we believe marks a significant step towards advancing quantum computing's role in solving practical engineering problems.">

By employing unified hyperparameters and network architectures for transmission and reflection problems, the capability of the algorithms to generalize over different environments is demonstrated. In addition, a comparison with a genetic algorithm highlights the potential for generalized design in complex environments, despite the algorithms tending to predict local maxima.

The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in (Qu et.al, 2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.">

In this work, we address this gap by demonstrating that quantum neural networks can exhibit this behavior and that skin effects, beyond their fundamental interest, can also be exploited in computational tasks. Specifically, we show that the performance of a given complex network used as a quantum reservoir computer is dictated solely by the boundary conditions of a dissipative line within its architecture.

The maintenance and replacement of aging infrastructure is becoming increasingly costly, as a large number of structures is approaching the end of its design lifetime. Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods.

A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is then evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results showcase the surprising ability of Poseidon to learn effective representations from a very small set of PDEs during pretraining in order to generalize well to unseen and unrelated PDEs downstream, demonstrating its potential as an effective, general purpose PDE foundation model. Finally, the Poseidon model as well as underlying pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced, with code being available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/poseidon and pretrained models and datasets at https://huggingface.co/camlab-ethz.">

        <tr id="Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved flexibility and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the calculation of the contrast variation into each of the subnetworks, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, which guarantees the physical interpretability of variables of the subnetworks. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.">

        <tr id="The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.">

        <tr id="High-dimensional Bayesian optimization (BO) tasks such as molecular design often require 10,000 function evaluations before obtaining meaningful results. While methods like sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGPs) reduce computational requirements in these settings, the underlying approximations result in suboptimal data acquisitions that slow the progress of optimization. In this paper we modify SVGPs to better align with the goals of BO: targeting informed data acquisition rather than global posterior fidelity. Using the framework of utility-calibrated variational inference, we unify GP approximation and data acquisition into a joint optimization problem, thereby ensuring optimal decisions under a limited computational budget. Our approach can be used with any decision-theoretic acquisition function and is compatible with trust region methods like TuRBO. We derive efficient joint objectives for the expected improvement and knowledge gradient acquisition functions in both the standard and batch BO settings. Our approach outperforms standard SVGPs on high-dimensional benchmark tasks in control and molecular design.">

        <tr id="For over 35 years of research, the debate about the systematic compositionality of neural networks remains unchanged, arguing that existing artificial neural networks are inadequate cognitive models. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly shaped the landscape of popular domains, however, the systematic combination of previously trained neural networks remains an open challenge. This study presents how to dynamically synthesize a neural network for the design of broadband electromagnetic metasurfaces. The underlying mechanism relies on an assembly network to adaptively integrate pre‐trained inherited networks in a transparent manner that corresponds to the metasurface assembly in physical space. This framework is poised to curtail data requirements and augment network flexibility, promising heightened practical utility in complex composition‐based tasks. Importantly, the intricate coupling effects between different metasurface segments are accurately captured. The approach for two broadband metasurface inverse design problems is exemplified, reaching accuracies of 96.7% and 95.5%. Along the way, the importance of suitably formatting the spectral data is highlighted to capture sharp spectral features. This study marks a significant leap forward in inheriting pre‐existing knowledge in neural‐network‐based inverse design, improving its adaptability for applications involving dynamically evolving tasks.">

        <tr id="Overparameterized stochastic differential equation (SDE) models have achieved remarkable success in various complex environments, such as PDE-constrained optimization, stochastic control and reinforcement learning, financial engineering, and neural SDEs. These models often feature system evolution coefficients that are parameterized by a high-dimensional vector $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^n$, aiming to optimize expectations of the SDE, such as a value function, through stochastic gradient ascent. Consequently, designing efficient gradient estimators for which the computational complexity scales well with $n$ is of significant interest. This paper introduces a novel unbiased stochastic gradient estimator--the generator gradient estimator--for which the computation time remains stable in $n$. In addition to establishing the validity of our methodology for general SDEs with jumps, we also perform numerical experiments that test our estimator in linear-quadratic control problems parameterized by high-dimensional neural networks. The results show a significant improvement in efficiency compared to the widely used pathwise differentiation method: Our estimator achieves near-constant computation times, increasingly outperforms its counterpart as $n$ increases, and does so without compromising estimation variance. These empirical findings highlight the potential of our proposed methodology for optimizing SDEs in contemporary applications.">
