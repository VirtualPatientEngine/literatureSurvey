        <tr id="Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.">

        <tr id="In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different time points. Here, we introduce RAINDROP, a graph neural network that embeds irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. RAINDROP represents every sample as a separate sensor graph and models time-varying dependencies between sensors with a novel message passing operator. It estimates the latent sensor graph structure and leverages the structure together with nearby observations to predict misaligned readouts. This model can be interpreted as a graph neural network that sends messages over graphs that are optimized for capturing time-varying dependencies among sensors. We use RAINDROP to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. RAINDROP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.4% (absolute F1-score points), including techniques that deal with irregular sampling using fixed discretization and set functions. RAINDROP shows superiority in diverse setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have shown to be effective in time series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global) inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate predictions.">

        <tr id="Outstanding achievements of graph neural networks for spatiotemporal time series analysis show that relational constraints introduce an effective inductive bias into neural forecasting architectures. Often, however, the relational information characterizing the underlying data-generating process is unavailable and the practitioner is left with the problem of inferring from data which relational graph to use in the subsequent processing stages. We propose novel, principled - yet practical - probabilistic score-based methods that learn the relational dependencies as distributions over graphs while maximizing end-to-end the performance at task. The proposed graph learning framework is based on consolidated variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo score-based gradient estimation, is theoretically grounded, and, as we show, effective in practice. In this paper, we focus on the time series forecasting problem and show that, by tailoring the gradient estimators to the graph learning problem, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance while controlling the sparsity of the learned graph and the computational scalability. We empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that the proposed solution can be used as a stand-alone graph identification procedure as well as a graph learning component of an end-to-end forecasting architecture.">

        <tr id="Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic) graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed, recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions.">

        <tr id="By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.">

        <tr id="Attention mechanisms have been widely used to capture long-range dependencies among nodes in Graph Transformers. Bottlenecked by the quadratic computational cost, attention mechanisms fail to scale in large graphs. Recent improvements in computational efficiency are mainly achieved by attention sparsification with random or heuristic-based graph subsampling, which falls short in data-dependent context reasoning. State space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained prominence for their effectiveness and efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, adapting SSMs to non-sequential graph data presents a notable challenge. In this work, we introduce Graph-Mamba, the first attempt to enhance long-range context modeling in graph networks by integrating a Mamba block with the input-dependent node selection mechanism. Specifically, we formulate graph-centric node prioritization and permutation strategies to enhance context-aware reasoning, leading to a substantial improvement in predictive performance. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-range graph prediction tasks, with a fraction of the computational cost in both FLOPs and GPU memory consumption.

        <tr id="Foundation models, especially LLMs, are profoundly transforming deep learning. Instead of training many task-specific models, we can adapt a single pretrained model to many tasks via fewshot prompting or fine-tuning. However, current foundation models apply to sequence data but not to time series, which present unique challenges due to the inherent diverse and multidomain time series datasets, diverging task specifications across forecasting, classification and other types of tasks, and the apparent need for task-specialized models. We developed UNITS, a unified time series model that supports a universal task specification, accommodating classification, forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection tasks. This is achieved through a novel unified network backbone, which incorporates sequence and variable attention along with a dynamic linear operator and is trained as a unified model. Across 38 multi-domain datasets, UNITS demonstrates superior performance compared to task-specific models and repurposed natural language-based LLMs. UNITS exhibits remarkable zero-shot, few-shot, and prompt learning capabilities when evaluated on new data domains and tasks.

        <tr id="Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.">

        <tr id="Large pre-trained models for zero/few-shot learning excel in language and vision domains but encounter challenges in multivariate time series (TS) due to the diverse nature and scarcity of publicly available pre-training data. Consequently, there has been a recent surge in utilizing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with token adaptations for TS forecasting. These approaches employ cross-domain transfer learning and surprisingly yield impressive results. However, these models are typically very slow and large (~billion parameters) and do not consider cross-channel correlations. To address this, we present Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a significantly small model based on the lightweight TSMixer architecture. TTM marks the first success in developing fast and tiny general pre-trained models (<1M parameters), exclusively trained on public TS datasets, with effective transfer learning capabilities for forecasting. To tackle the complexity of pre-training on multiple datasets with varied temporal resolutions, we introduce several novel enhancements such as adaptive patching, dataset augmentation via downsampling, and resolution prefix tuning. Moreover, we employ a multi-level modeling strategy to effectively model channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning, a crucial capability lacking in existing benchmarks. TTM shows significant accuracy gains (12-38\%) over popular benchmarks in few/zero-shot forecasting. It also drastically reduces the compute needs as compared to LLM-TS methods, with a 14X cut in learnable parameters, 106X less total parameters, and substantial reductions in fine-tuning (65X) and inference time (54X). In fact, TTM's zero-shot often surpasses the few-shot results in many popular benchmarks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach.

        <tr id="Pre-training on time series poses a unique challenge due to the potential mismatch between pre-training and target domains, such as shifts in temporal dynamics, fast-evolving trends, and long-range and short-cyclic effects, which can lead to poor downstream performance. While domain adaptation methods can mitigate these shifts, most methods need examples directly from the target domain, making them suboptimal for pre-training. To address this challenge, methods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and be capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training. Relative to other modalities, in time series, we expect that time-based and frequency-based representations of the same example are located close together in the time-frequency space. To this end, we posit that time-frequency consistency (TF-C) -- embedding a time-based neighborhood of an example close to its frequency-based neighborhood -- is desirable for pre-training. Motivated by TF-C, we define a decomposable pre-training model, where the self-supervised signal is provided by the distance between time and frequency components, each individually trained by contrastive estimation. We evaluate the new method on eight datasets, including electrodiagnostic testing, human activity recognition, mechanical fault detection, and physical status monitoring. Experiments against eight state-of-the-art methods show that TF-C outperforms baselines by 15.4% (F1 score) on average in one-to-one settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model on EMG data) and by 8.4% (precision) in challenging one-to-many settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model for either hand-gesture recognition or mechanical fault prediction), reflecting the breadth of scenarios that arise in real-world applications.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that Raincoat can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.">

The proposed AZ-test can be intended as a spatio-temporal extension of traditional tests designed for system identiﬁcation to graph signals. The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes over time, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as it is the case in many application scenarios like sensor and transportation networks. The asymptotic distribution of the designed test can be derived under the null hypothesis without assuming identically distributed data. We show the effectiveness of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and illustrate how it can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graph stream.">

The manuscript aims, for the first time, at filling this gap by matching state-space modeling and spatio-temporal data where the relational information, say the functional graph capturing latent dependencies, is learned directly from data and is allowed to change over time. Within a probabilistic formulation that accounts for the uncertainty in the data-generating process, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn the state-space model end-to-end on a downstream task.

        <tr id="Time series data are ubiquitous across various domains, making time series analysis critically important. Traditional time series models are task-specific, featuring singular functionality and limited generalization capacity. Recently, large language foundation models have unveiled their remarkable capabilities for cross-task transferability, zero-shot/few-shot learning, and decision-making explainability. This success has sparked interest in the exploration of foundation models to solve multiple time series challenges simultaneously. There are two main research lines, namely pre-training foundation models from scratch for time series and adapting large language foundation models for time series. They both contribute to the development of a unified model that is highly generalizable, versatile, and comprehensible for time series analysis. This survey offers a 3E analytical framework for comprehensive examination of related research. Specifically, we examine existing works from three dimensions, namely Effectiveness, Efficiency and Explainability. In each dimension, we focus on discussing how related works devise tailored solution by considering unique challenges in the realm of time series. Furthermore, we provide a domain taxonomy to help followers keep up with the domain-specific advancements. In addition, we introduce extensive resources to facilitate the field's development, including datasets, open-source, time series libraries.

While Transformer-based models excel at capturing long-range dependencies, they face limitations in noise sensitivity, computational efficiency, and overfitting with smaller datasets. In response, we introduce a novel Time Series Lightweight Adaptive Network (TSLANet), as a universal convolutional model for diverse time series tasks. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Spectral Block, harnessing Fourier analysis to enhance feature representation and to capture both long-term and short-term interactions while mitigating noise via adaptive thresholding. Additionally, we introduce an Interactive Convolution Block and leverage self-supervised learning to refine the capacity of TSLANet for decoding complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness on different datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TSLANet outperforms state-of-the-art models in various tasks spanning classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection, showcasing its resilience and adaptability across a spectrum of noise levels and data sizes.

        <tr id="Real-world time series often exhibit complex interdependencies that cannot be captured in isolation. Global models that model past data from multiple related time series globally while producing series-specific forecasts locally are now common. However, their forecasts for each individual series remain isolated, failing to account for the current state of its neighbouring series. Multivariate models like multivariate attention and graph neural networks can explicitly incorporate inter-series information, thus addressing the shortcomings of global models. However, these techniques exhibit quadratic complexity per timestep, limiting scalability. This paper introduces the Context Neural Network, an efficient linear complexity approach for augmenting time series models with relevant contextual insights from neighbouring time series without significant computational overhead. The proposed method enriches predictive models by providing the target series with real-time information from its neighbours, addressing the limitations of global models, yet remaining computationally tractable for large datasets.">

While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention in recent decades. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy improves forecasting performance by treating different channels individually, while it leads to poor generalization on unseen instances and ignores potentially necessary interactions between channels. Conversely, the Channel-Dependent (CD) strategy mixes all channels with even irrelevant and indiscriminate information, which, however, results in oversmoothing issues and limits forecasting accuracy. There is a lack of channel strategy that effectively balances individual channel treatment for improved forecasting performance without overlooking essential interactions between channels. Motivated by our observation of a correlation between the time series model's performance boost against channel mixing and the intrinsic similarity on a pair of channels, we developed a novel and adaptable Channel Clustering Module (CCM). CCM dynamically groups channels characterized by intrinsic similarities and leverages cluster identity instead of channel identity, combining the best of CD and CI worlds. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CCM can (1) boost the performance of CI and CD models by an average margin of 2.4% and 7.2% on long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively; (2) enable zero-shot forecasting with mainstream time series forecasting models; (3) uncover intrinsic time series patterns among channels and improve interpretability of complex time series models.">

This reduces training time and increases the versatility of the model by allowing any time granularity and forecast horizon.

Traditional Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in TSRL fall into four main categories: reconstructive, adversarial, contrastive, and predictive, each with a common challenge of sensitivity to noise and intricate data nuances. Recently, diffusion-based methods have shown advanced generative capabilities. However, they primarily target specific application scenarios like imputation and forecasting, leaving a gap in leveraging diffusion models for generic TSRL. Our work, Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE), bridges this gap as the first diffusion-based SSL TSRL approach. TSDE segments TS data into observed and masked parts using an Imputation-Interpolation-Forecasting (IIF) mask. It applies a trainable embedding function, featuring dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders with a crossover mechanism, to the observed part. We train a reverse diffusion process conditioned on the embeddings, designed to predict noise added to the masked part. Extensive experiments demonstrate TSDE's superiority in imputation, interpolation, forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and clustering. We also conduct an ablation study, present embedding visualizations, and compare inference speed, further substantiating TSDE's efficiency and validity in learning representations of TS data.">

Although transformers have proven to be effective in capturing dependency, its quadratic complexity of attention mechanism prevents its further adoption in long-range time series forecasting, thus limiting them attend to short-range range. Recent progress on state space models (SSMs) have shown impressive performance on modeling long range dependency due to their subquadratic complexity. Mamba, as a representative SSM, enjoys linear time complexity and has achieved strong scalability on tasks that requires scaling to long sequences, such as language, audio, and genomics.

Traditional methods often fall short in addressing the complex dependencies and dynamics inherent in such data, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications. This work introduces a comprehensive approach that leverages Graph Attention Networks (GATs), Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAEs), transfer learning with pretrained transformers, and Bayesian state-space models to overcome these limitations. GATs are selected for their ability to dynamically focus on relevant modalities through attention mechanisms, thereby capturing the intricate relationships between different data modalities. This method significantly enhances the model's ability to integrate multimodal information, leading to notable improvements in classification, prediction, and anomaly detection tasks. VGAEs are utilized to learn latent representations within a graph-based framework, promoting unsupervised learning while unveiling the underlying data structure. The resultant embeddings are pivotal for downstream tasks like clustering and visualization, encapsulating the interactions within multimodal time series data effectively. Furthermore, this work incorporates transfer learning with pretrained transformers to harness extensive knowledge from large datasets, adapting it to multimodal time series analysis. This strategy excels in capturing long-range dependencies, thereby augmenting generalization and performance in data-scarce scenarios. Bayesian state-space models are employed to elucidate the temporal dynamics and uncertainties of time series data, offering a robust framework for probabilistic inference and enhancing the interpretability and reliability of forecasting and anomaly detection. The efficacy of the proposed model is rigorously evaluated using diverse datasets, including the Yahoo! Stock Dataset, Forest Cover Dataset, and an empirical collection of 100k time series data samples. The results demonstrate a significant leap in performance metrics, including a 9.5% increase in precision, 8.5% boost in accuracy, 8.3% rise in recall, 10.4% reduction in delay, 9.4% enhancement in AUC, and a 5.9% improvement in specificity, alongside superior pre-emption capabilities compared to existing methods. This work not only addresses the pressing need for advanced multimodal time series analysis techniques but also sets a new benchmark for efficiency and accuracy.

In contrast, another approach embeds the time points of individual series into separate variate tokens. The former method faces challenges in learning variate-centric representations, while the latter risks missing essential temporal information critical for accurate forecasting. In our work, we introduce GridTST, a model that combines the benefits of two approaches using innovative multi-directional attentions based on a vanilla Transformer. We regard the input time series data as a grid, where the $x$-axis represents the time steps and the $y$-axis represents the variates. A vertical slicing of this grid combines the variates at each time step into a \textit{time token}, while a horizontal slicing embeds the individual series across all time steps into a \textit{variate token}. Correspondingly, a \textit{horizontal attention mechanism} focuses on time tokens to comprehend the correlations between data at various time steps, while a \textit{vertical}, variate-aware \textit{attention} is employed to grasp multivariate correlations. This combination enables efficient processing of information across both time and variate dimensions, thereby enhancing the model's analytical strength. % We also integrate the patch technique, segmenting time tokens into subseries-level patches, ensuring that local semantic information is retained in the embedding.

Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments.

With the selective capability on input data and the hardware-aware parallel computing algorithm, Mamba has shown great potential in balancing predicting performance and computational efficiency compared to Transformers. To enhance Mamba's ability to preserve historical information in a longer range, we design a novel Mamba+ block by adding a forget gate inside Mamba to selectively combine the new features with the historical features in a complementary manner. Furthermore, we apply Mamba+ both forward and backward and propose Bi-Mamba+, aiming to promote the model's ability to capture interactions among time series elements.

        <tr id="This paper introduces SparseTSF, a novel, extremely lightweight model for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), designed to address the challenges of modeling complex temporal dependencies over extended horizons with minimal computational resources. At the heart of SparseTSF lies the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique, which simplifies the forecasting task by decoupling the periodicity and trend in time series data. This technique involves downsampling the original sequences to focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features while minimizing the model's complexity and parameter count. Based on this technique, the SparseTSF model uses fewer than 1k parameters to achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SparseTSF showcases remarkable generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited computational resources, small samples, or low-quality data.

        <tr id="Deep learning methods have been exerting their strengths in long-term time series forecasting. However, they often struggle to strike a balance between expressive power and computational efficiency. Resorting to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) provides a compromising solution, yet they suffer from two critical problems caused by the intrinsic point-wise mapping mode, in terms of deficient contextual dependencies and inadequate information bottleneck. Here, we propose the Coarsened Perceptron Network (CP-Net), featured by a coarsening strategy that alleviates the above problems associated with the prototype MLPs by forming information granules in place of solitary temporal points. The CP-Net utilizes primarily a two-stage framework for extracting semantic and contextual patterns, which preserves correlations over larger timespans and filters out volatile noises. This is further enhanced by a multi-scale setting, where patterns of diverse granularities are fused towards a comprehensive prediction. Based purely on convolutions of structural simplicity, CP-Net is able to maintain a linear computational complexity and low runtime, while demonstrates an improvement of 4.1% compared with the SOTA method on seven forecasting benchmarks.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting is widely used in extensive applications, such as traffic planning and weather forecasting. However, real-world time series usually present intricate temporal variations, making forecasting extremely challenging. Going beyond the mainstream paradigms of plain decomposition and multiperiodicity analysis, we analyze temporal variations in a novel view of multiscale-mixing, which is based on an intuitive but important observation that time series present distinct patterns in different sampling scales. The microscopic and the macroscopic information are reflected in fine and coarse scales respectively, and thereby complex variations can be inherently disentangled. Based on this observation, we propose TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM) blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases. Concretely, PDM applies the decomposition to multiscale series and further mixes the decomposed seasonal and trend components in fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions separately, which successively aggregates the microscopic seasonal and macroscopic trend information. FMM further ensembles multiple predictors to utilize complementary forecasting capabilities in multiscale observations. Consequently, TimeMixer is able to achieve consistent state-of-the-art performances in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency.">

The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.">

To address the limitation in existing Transformer-based models, which struggle with intricate temporal patterns in long-term forecasting, Patchformer employs patch embedding, which predicts multivariate time-series data by separating it into multiple univariate data and segmenting each of them into multiple patches. This method effectively enhances the model's ability to capture local and global semantic dependencies. The numerical analysis shows that the Patchformer obtains overall better prediction accuracy in both multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting on the novel Multi-Energy dataset and other benchmark datasets. In addition, the positive effect of the interdependence among energy-related products on the performance of long-term time-series forecasting across Patchformer and other compared models is discovered, and the superiority of the Patchformer against other models is also demonstrated, which presents a significant advancement in handling the interdependence and complexities of long-term multi-energy forecasting. Lastly, Patchformer is illustrated as the only model that follows the positive correlation between model performance and the length of the past sequence, which states its ability to capture long-range past local semantic information.">

        <tr id="Time Series Forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as industrial equipment maintenance, meteorology, energy consumption, traffic flow and financial investment. However, despite their considerable advantages over traditional statistical approaches, current deep learning-based predictive models often exhibit a significant deviation between their forecasting outcomes and the ground truth. This discrepancy is largely due to an insufficient emphasis on extracting the sequence's latent information, particularly its global information within the frequency domain and the relationship between different variables. To address this issue, we propose a novel model Frequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons, which decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components using a multi-scale sequence adaptive decomposition and fusion architecture, and processes them separately. FAITH utilizes Frequency Channel feature Extraction Module and Frequency Temporal feature Extraction Module to capture inter-channel relationships and temporal global information in the sequence, significantly improving its ability to handle long-term dependencies and complex patterns. Furthermore, FAITH achieves theoretically linear complexity by modifying the time-frequency domain transformation method, effectively reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks for long-term forecasting and 3 benchmarks for short-term forecasting demonstrate that FAITH outperforms existing models in many fields, such as electricity, weather and traffic, proving its effectiveness and superiority both in long-term and short-term time series forecasting tasks.

        <tr id="Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is crucial for decision-making to precisely forecast the future values/trends, based on the complex relationships identified from historical observations of multiple sequences. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have gradually become the theme of MTSF model as their powerful capability in mining spatial-temporal dependencies, but almost of them heavily rely on the assumption of historical data integrity. In reality, due to factors such as data collector failures and time-consuming repairment, it is extremely challenging to collect the whole historical observations without missing any variable. In this case, STGNNs can only utilize a subset of normal variables and easily suffer from the incorrect spatial-temporal dependency modeling issue, resulting in the degradation of their forecasting performance. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Interpolation Attention Recursive Network (named GinAR) to precisely model the spatial-temporal dependencies over the limited collected data for forecasting. In GinAR, it consists of two key components, that is, interpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution to take place of the fully connected layer of simple recursive units, and thus are capable of recovering all missing variables and reconstructing the correct spatial-temporal dependencies for recursively modeling of multivariate time series data, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GinAR outperforms 11 SOTA baselines, and even when 90% of variables are missing, it can still accurately predict the future values of all variables.">

Despite recent advancements, learning cluster-friendly representations is still challenging, particularly with long and complex time series. Deep temporal clustering methods have been trying to integrate the canonical k-means into end-to-end training of neural networks but fall back on surrogate losses due to the non-differentiability of the hard cluster assignment, yielding sub-optimal solutions. In addition, the autoregressive strategy used in the state-of-the-art RNNs is subject to error accumulation and slow training, while recent research findings have revealed that Transformers are less effective due to time points lacking semantic meaning, to the permutation invariance of attention that discards the chronological order and high computation cost. In light of these observations, we present LoSTer which is a novel dense autoencoder architecture for the long-sequence time series clustering problem (LSTC) capable of optimizing the k-means objective via the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization trick and designed specifically for accurate and fast clustering of long time series. Extensive experiments on numerous benchmark datasets and two real-world applications prove the effectiveness of LoSTer over state-of-the-art RNNs and Transformer-based deep clustering methods.">

Our novel approach, TimeMIL, formulates the temporal correlation and ordering within a time-aware MIL pooling, leveraging a tokenized transformer with a specialized learnable wavelet positional token.

        <tr id="Multivariate time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as finance, traffic management, energy, and healthcare. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of channel independence to resist distribution drift but neglect channel correlations, limiting further enhancements. Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Dispatch (STAD) module. Unlike traditional approaches that manage channel interactions through distributed structures, e.g., attention, STAD employs a centralized strategy. It aggregates all series to form a global core representation, which is then dispatched and fused with individual series representations to facilitate channel interactions effectively. SOFTS achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods with only linear complexity. The broad applicability of the STAD module across different forecasting models is also demonstrated empirically.

        <tr id="Models employing CNN architecture have made significant progress in multivariate long sequence time-series forecasting (MLSTF), particularly in modeling local time series characteristics. However, during the MLSTF process, extracting the global time series patterns and understanding the correlations among different variables are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information across different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture correlated features between variables. Building upon this, we propose ATVCNet, an adaptive temporal-variable convolutional network designed to effectively model the local/global temporal dependencies and inter-variable dependencies of multivariate time series. Specifically, extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, captures both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed inter-variable feature adaptive extraction module captures the correlation among different variables in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ATVCNet across eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that ATVCNet achieved a performance improvement of approximately 63.4% over state-of-the-art MLSTF models.">

To address this issue, we propose a Score-weighted Convolutional Diffusion Model (Score-CDM for short), whose backbone consists of a Score-weighted Convolution Module (SCM) and an Adaptive Reception Module (ARM). SCM adopts a score map to capture the global temporal features in the time domain, while ARM uses a Spectral2Time Window Block (S2TWB) to convolve the local time series data in the spectral domain. Benefiting from the time convolution properties of Fast Fourier Transformation, ARM can adaptively change the receptive field of the score map, and thus effectively balance the local and global temporal features. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real MTS datasets of different domains, and the result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Score-CDM.">

        <tr id="In multivariate time series forecasting, the Transformer architecture encounters two significant challenges: effectively mining features from historical sequences and avoiding overfitting during the learning of temporal dependencies. To tackle these challenges, this paper deconstructs time series forecasting into the learning of historical sequences and prediction sequences, introducing the Cross-Variable and Time Network (CVTN). This unique method divides multivariate time series forecasting into two phases: cross-variable learning for effectively mining fea tures from historical sequences, and cross-time learning to capture the temporal dependencies of prediction sequences. Separating these two phases helps avoid the impact of overfitting in cross-time learning on cross-variable learning. Exten sive experiments on various real-world datasets have confirmed its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. CVTN emphasizes three key dimensions in time series fore casting: the short-term and long-term nature of time series (locality and longevity), feature mining from both historical and prediction sequences, and the integration of cross-variable and cross-time learning. This approach not only advances the current state of time series forecasting but also provides a more comprehensive framework for future research in this field.">

Therefore, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning scheme. Specifically, our approach implicitly captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learning spatial and temporal embeddings, which can be viewed as a clustering process. Then, a novel spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning paradigm is proposed to learn spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools, which is informed by the captured heterogeneity. Based on these ideas, we develop a Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet) for spatiotemporal time series forecasting.

        <tr id="Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Networks are widely employed in time-series forecasting tasks, demonstrating effectiveness in univariate and certain multivariate scenarios. However, their inherent structure does not readily accommodate the integration of future, time-dependent covariates. A proposed solution, outlined by Salinas et al 2019, suggests forecasting both covariates and the target variable in a multivariate framework. In this study, we conducted comprehensive tests on publicly available time-series datasets, artificially introducing highly correlated covariates to future time-step values. Our evaluation aimed to assess the performance of an LSTM network when considering these covariates and compare it against a univariate baseline. As part of this study we introduce a novel approach using seasonal time segments in combination with an RNN architecture, which is both simple and extremely effective over long forecast horizons with comparable performance to many state of the art architectures. Our findings from the results of more than 120 models reveal that under certain conditions jointly training covariates with target variables can improve overall performance of the model, but often there exists a significant performance disparity between multivariate and univariate predictions. Surprisingly, even when provided with covariates informing the network about future target values, multivariate predictions exhibited inferior performance. In essence, compelling the network to predict multiple values can prove detrimental to model performance, even in the presence of informative covariates. These results suggest that LSTM architectures may not be suitable for forecasting tasks where predicting covariates would typically be expected to enhance model accuracy.">

Recent research has abandoned Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and utilized dilated convolutions or temporal slicing for feature extraction, and they have the following drawbacks: (1) Dilated convolutions fail to capture the features of adjacent time steps, resulting in the loss of crucial transitional data. (2) The connections within the same temporal slice are strong, while the connections between different temporal slices are too loose. In light of these limitations, we emphasize the importance of analyzing a complete time series repeatedly and the crucial role of GRU in MTS. Therefore, we propose SGRU: Structured Gated Recurrent Units, which involve structured GRU layers and non-linear units, along with multiple layers of time embedding to enhance the model’s fitting performance.

But it remains unknown whether non-trivial forecasting implies that language models can reason about time series. To address this gap, we generate a first-of-its-kind evaluation framework for time series reasoning, including formal tasks and a corresponding dataset of multi-scale time series paired with text captions across ten domains. Using these data, we probe whether language models achieve three forms of reasoning: (1) Etiological Reasoning - given an input time series, can the language model identify the scenario that most likely created it? (2) Question Answering - can a language model answer factual questions about time series? (3) Context-Aided Forecasting - does highly relevant textual context improve a language model's time series forecasts? We find that otherwise highly-capable language models demonstrate surprisingly limited time series reasoning: they score marginally above random on etiological and question answering tasks (up to 30 percentage points worse than humans) and show modest success in using context to improve forecasting. These weakness showcase that time series reasoning is an impactful, yet deeply underdeveloped direction for language model research. We also make our datasets and code public at to support further research in this direction at https://github.com/behavioral-data/TSandLanguage">

Time series forecasting shares a similar sequential structure to language, and is amenable to large-scale transformer architectures. Here we show that foundational decoder-only time series transformer models exhibit analogous scaling-behavior to LLMs, while architectural details (aspect ratio and number of heads) have a minimal effect over broad ranges. We assemble a large corpus of heterogenous time series data on which to train, and establish, for the first time, power-law scaling relations with respect to parameter count, dataset size, and training compute, spanning five orders of magnitude.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of machine learning on non-Euclidean data such as graphs and networks. GNNs effectively implement node representation learning through neighborhood aggregation and achieve impressive results in many graph-related tasks. However, most neighborhood aggregation approaches are summation-based, which can be problematic as they may not be sufficiently expressive to encode informative graph structures. Furthermore, though the graph pooling module is also of vital importance for graph learning, especially for the task of graph classification, research on graph down-sampling mechanisms is rather limited. To address the above challenges, we propose a concatenation-based graph convolution mechanism that injectively updates node representations to maximize the discriminative power in distinguishing non-isomorphic subgraphs. In addition, we design a novel graph pooling module, called WL-SortPool, to learn important subgraph patterns in a deep-learning manner. WL-SortPool layer-wise sorts node representations (i.e. continuous WL colors) to separately learn the relative importance of subtrees with different depths for the purpose of classification, thus better characterizing the complex graph topology and rich information encoded in the graph. We propose a novel Subgraph Pattern GNN (SPGNN) architecture that incorporates these enhancements. We test the proposed SPGNN architecture on many graph classification benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method can achieve highly competitive results with state-of-the-art graph kernels and other GNN approaches.">

        <tr id="The modeling of environmental ecosystems plays a pivotal role in the sustainable management of our planet. Accurate prediction of key environmental variables over space and time can aid in informed policy and decision-making, thus improving people's livelihood. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promise in modeling the spatial-temporal relationships for predicting environmental variables. However, these approaches often fall short in handling incomplete features and distribution shifts, which are commonly observed in environmental data due to the substantial cost of data collection and malfunctions in measuring instruments. To address these issues, we propose LITE -- a multimodal large language model for environmental ecosystems modeling. Specifically, LITE unifies different environmental variables by transforming them into natural language descriptions and line graph images. Then, LITE utilizes unified encoders to capture spatial-temporal dynamics and correlations in different modalities. During this step, the incomplete features are imputed by a sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework, and the distribution shift is handled by incorporating multi-granularity information from past observations. Finally, guided by domain instructions, a language model is employed to fuse the multimodal representations for the prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly enhances performance in environmental spatial-temporal prediction across different domains compared to the best baseline, with a 41.25% reduction in prediction error. This justifies its effectiveness. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/hrlics/LITE.">

Many recent proposals that target deep learning for spatio-temporal prediction suffer from so-called catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. Such proposals may experience deteriorating prediction performance when applied in settings where data streams into the system. To enable spatio-temporal prediction on streaming data, we propose a unified replay-based continuous learning framework. The framework includes a replay buffer of previously learned samples that are fused with training data using a spatio-temporal mixup mechanism in order to preserve historical knowledge effectively, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. To enable holistic representation preservation, the framework also integrates a general spatio-temporal autoencoder with a carefully designed spatio-temporal simple siamese (STSimSiam) network that aims to ensure prediction accuracy and avoid holistic feature loss by means of mutual information maximization. The framework further encompasses five spatio-temporal data augmentation methods to enhance the performance of STSimSiam. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.">

While automatic augmentation has demonstrated success in image classification tasks, its application to time-series problems, particularly in long-term forecasting, has received comparatively less attention. To address this gap, we introduce a time-series automatic augmentation approach named TSAA, which is both efficient and easy to implement. The solution involves tackling the associated bilevel optimization problem through a two-step process: initially training a non-augmented model for a limited number of epochs, followed by an iterative split procedure. During this iterative process, we alternate between identifying a robust augmentation policy through Bayesian optimization and refining the model while discarding suboptimal runs. Extensive evaluations on challenging univariate and multivariate forecasting benchmark problems demonstrate that TSAA consistently outperforms several robust baselines, suggesting its potential integration into prediction pipelines.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based methods have made significant progress in time series forecasting (TSF). They primarily handle two types of tokens, i.e., temporal tokens that contain all variables of the same timestamp, and variable tokens that contain all input time points for a specific variable. Transformer-based methods rely on positional encoding (PE) to mark tokens' positions, facilitating the model to perceive the correlation between tokens. However, in TSF, research on PE remains insufficient. To address this gap, we conduct experiments and uncover intriguing properties of existing PEs in TSF: (i) The positional information injected by PEs diminishes as the network depth increases; (ii) Enhancing positional information in deep networks is advantageous for improving the model's performance; (iii) PE based on the similarity between tokens can improve the model's performance. Motivated by these findings, we introduce two new PEs: Temporal Position Encoding (T-PE) for temporal tokens and Variable Positional Encoding (V-PE) for variable tokens. Both T-PE and V-PE incorporate geometric PE based on tokens' positions and semantic PE based on the similarity between tokens but using different calculations. To leverage both the PEs, we design a Transformer-based dual-branch framework named T2B-PE. It first calculates temporal tokens' correlation and variable tokens' correlation respectively and then fuses the dual-branch features through the gated unit. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior robustness and effectiveness of T2B-PE.

In this work, we investigate this problem from an information theoretic perspective and show that most existing measures of explainability may suffer from trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet practical objective function for time series explainable learning. The design of the objective function builds upon the principle of information bottleneck (IB), and modifies the IB objective function to avoid trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. We further present TimeX++, a novel explanation framework that leverages a parametric network to produce explanation-embedded instances that are both in-distributed and label-preserving. We evaluate TimeX++ on both synthetic and real-world datasets comparing its performance against leading baselines, and validate its practical efficacy through case studies in a real-world environmental application. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that TimeX++ outperforms baselines across all datasets, demonstrating a substantial improvement in explanation quality for time series data.

The sequential representation methods focus only on the temporal relationships among longitudinal visits. On the other hand, the graphical representation approaches, while adept at extracting the graph-structured relationships between various medical events, fall short in effectively integrate temporal information. To capture both types of information, we model a patient's EHR as a novel temporal heterogeneous graph. This graph includes historical visits nodes and medical events nodes. It propagates structured information from medical event nodes to visit nodes and utilizes time-aware visit nodes to capture changes in the patient's health status.

Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

        <tr id="Inductive representation learning on temporal heterogeneous graphs is crucial for scalable deep learning on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) which are time-varying, such as citation networks. However, most existing approaches are not inductive and thus cannot handle new nodes or edges. Moreover, previous temporal graph embedding methods are often trained with the temporal link prediction task to simulate the link formation process of temporal graphs, while ignoring the evolution of high-order topological structures on temporal graphs. To fill these gaps, we propose a Continuous-Time Representation Learning (CTRL) model on temporal HINs. To preserve heterogeneous node features and temporal structures, CTRL integrates three parts in a single layer, they are 1) a \emph{heterogeneous attention} unit that measures the semantic correlation between nodes, 2) a \emph{edge-based Hawkes process} to capture temporal influence between heterogeneous nodes, and 3) \emph{dynamic centrality} that indicates the dynamic importance of a node. We train the CTRL model with a future event (a subgraph) prediction task to capture the evolution of the high-order network structure. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our model significantly boosts performance and outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model design.">

        <tr id="This work proposes a time series prediction method based on the kernel view of linear reservoirs. In particular, the time series motifs of the reservoir kernel are used as representational basis on which general readouts are constructed. We provide a geometric interpretation of our approach shedding light on how our approach is related to the core reservoir models and in what way the two approaches differ. Empirical experiments then compare predictive performances of our suggested model with those of recent state-of-art transformer based models, as well as the established recurrent network model - LSTM. The experiments are performed on both univariate and multivariate time series and with a variety of prediction horizons. Rather surprisingly we show that even when linear readout is employed, our method has the capacity to outperform transformer models on univariate time series and attain competitive results on multivariate benchmark datasets. We conclude that simple models with easily controllable capacity but capturing enough memory and subsequence structure can outperform potentially over-complicated deep learning models. This does not mean that reservoir motif based models are preferable to other more complex alternatives - rather, when introducing a new complex time series model one should employ as a sanity check simple, but potentially powerful alternatives/baselines such as reservoir models or the models introduced here.">

        <tr id="Accurate weather forecasting is crucial in various sectors, impacting decision-making processes and societal events. Data-driven approaches based on machine learning models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to numerical weather prediction models given their potential to capture physics of different scales from historical data and the significantly lower computational cost during the prediction stage. Renowned for its state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, the Transformer model has also gained popularity in machine learning weather prediction. Yet applying Transformer architectures to weather forecasting, particularly on a global scale is computationally challenging due to the quadratic complexity of attention and the quadratic increase in spatial points as resolution increases. In this work, we propose a factorized-attention-based model tailored for spherical geometries to mitigate this issue. More specifically, it utilizes multi-dimensional factorized kernels that convolve over different axes where the computational complexity of the kernel is only quadratic to the axial resolution instead of overall resolution. The deterministic forecasting accuracy of the proposed model on $1.5^\circ$ and 0-7 days' lead time is on par with state-of-the-art purely data-driven machine learning weather prediction models. We also showcase the proposed model holds great potential to push forward the Pareto front of accuracy-efficiency for Transformer weather models, where it can achieve better accuracy with less computational cost compared to Transformer based models with standard attention.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have attempted to refine the Transformer architecture to demonstrate its effectiveness in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Despite surpassing many linear forecasting models with ever-improving performance, we remain skeptical of Transformers as a solution for LTSF. We attribute the effectiveness of these models largely to the adopted Patch mechanism, which enhances sequence locality to an extent yet fails to fully address the loss of temporal information inherent to the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism. Further investigation suggests that simple linear layers augmented with the Patch mechanism may outperform complex Transformer-based LTSF models. Moreover, diverging from models that use channel independence, our research underscores the importance of cross-variable interactions in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series forecasting. The interaction information between variables is highly valuable but has been misapplied in past studies, leading to suboptimal cross-variable models. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and simple Patch-based Decomposed MLP (PDMLP) for LTSF tasks. Specifically, we employ simple moving averages to extract smooth components and noise-containing residuals from time series data, engaging in semantic information interchange through channel mixing and specializing in random noise with channel independence processing. The PDMLP model consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several real-world datasets. We hope this surprising finding will spur new research directions in the LTSF field and pave the way for more efficient and concise solutions.">

In recent years, inspired by self-supervised learning, contrastive Heterogeneous Graphs Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown great potential by utilizing data augmentation and contrastive discriminators for downstream tasks. However, data augmentation is still limited due to the graph data's integrity. Furthermore, the contrastive discriminators remain sampling bias and lack local heterogeneous information. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (GHGCL). Specifically, we first propose a heterogeneous graph generative learning enhanced contrastive paradigm. This paradigm includes: 1) A contrastive view augmentation strategy by using a masked autoencoder. 2) Position-aware and semantics-aware positive sample sampling strategy for generating hard negative samples. 3) A hierarchical contrastive learning strategy for capturing local and global information. Furthermore, the hierarchical contrastive learning and sampling strategies aim to constitute an enhanced contrastive discriminator under the generative-contrastive perspective. Finally, we compare our model with seventeen baselines on eight real-world datasets. Our model outperforms the latest contrastive and generative baselines on node classification and link prediction tasks.

However, there is no consensus about what the best approach is. Besides, lag selection procedures have been developed based on local models and classical forecasting techniques such as ARIMA. We bridge this gap in the literature by carrying out an extensive empirical analysis of different lag selection methods. We focus on deep learning methods trained in a global approach, i.e., on datasets comprising multiple univariate time series. The experiments were carried out using three benchmark databases that contain a total of 2411 univariate time series. The results indicate that the lag size is a relevant parameter for accurate forecasts. In particular, excessively small or excessively large lag sizes have a considerable negative impact on forecasting performance. Cross-validation approaches show the best performance for lag selection, but this performance is comparable with simple heuristics.">

        <tr id="Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.">

        <tr id="Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely adopted in a wide range of tasks, leading to increasing attention towards the research on how scaling LLMs affects their performance. Existing works, termed as Scaling Laws, have discovered that the loss of LLMs scales as power laws with model size, computational budget, and dataset size. However, the performance of LLMs throughout the training process remains untouched. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of Temporal Scaling Law and study the loss of LLMs from the temporal dimension. We first investigate the imbalance of loss on each token positions and develop a reciprocal-law across model scales and training stages. We then derive the temporal scaling law by studying the temporal patterns of the reciprocal-law parameters. Results on both in-distribution (IID) data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data demonstrate that our temporal scaling law accurately predicts the performance of LLMs in future training stages. Moreover, the temporal scaling law reveals that LLMs learn uniformly on different token positions, despite the loss imbalance. Experiments on pre-training LLMs in various scales show that this phenomenon verifies the default training paradigm for generative language models, in which no re-weighting strategies are attached during training. Overall, the temporal scaling law provides deeper insight into LLM pre-training.">

        <tr id="In recent years, deep learning on graphs has achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, the reliance on annotated graph data remains a significant bottleneck due to its prohibitive cost and time-intensive nature. To address this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs has gained increasing attention and has made significant progress. SSL enables machine learning models to produce informative representations from unlabeled graph data, reducing the reliance on expensive labeled data. While SSL on graphs has witnessed widespread adoption, one critical component, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), has not been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. Thus, this survey aims to fill this gap by offering a dedicated survey on GCL. We provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles of GCL, including data augmentation strategies, contrastive modes, and contrastive optimization objectives. Furthermore, we explore the extensions of GCL to other aspects of data-efficient graph learning, such as weakly supervised learning, transfer learning, and related scenarios. We also discuss practical applications spanning domains such as drug discovery, genomics analysis, recommender systems, and finally outline the challenges and potential future directions in this field.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in graph representation learning. Message passing neural networks, which learn representations through recursively aggregating information from each node and its neighbors, are among the most commonly-used GNNs. However, a wealth of structural information of individual nodes and full graphs is often ignored in such process, which restricts the expressive power of GNNs. Various graph data augmentation methods that enable the message passing with richer structure knowledge have been introduced as one main way to tackle this issue, but they are often focused on individual structure features and difficult to scale up with more structure features. In this work we propose a novel approach, namely collective structure knowledge-augmented graph neural network (CoS-GNN), in which a new message passing method is introduced to allow GNNs to harness a diverse set of node- and graph-level structure features, together with original node features/attributes, in augmented graphs. In doing so, our approach largely improves the structural knowledge modeling of GNNs in both node and graph levels, resulting in substantially improved graph representations. This is justified by extensive empirical results where CoS-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in various graph-level learning tasks, including graph classification, anomaly detection, and out-of-distribution generalization.">

        <tr id="Recent state-of-the-art forecasting methods are trained on collections of time series. These methods, often referred to as global models, can capture common patterns in different time series to improve their generalization performance. However, they require large amounts of data that might not be readily available. Besides this, global models sometimes fail to capture relevant patterns unique to a particular time series. In these cases, data augmentation can be useful to increase the sample size of time series datasets. The main contribution of this work is a novel method for generating univariate time series synthetic samples. Our approach stems from the insight that the observations concerning a particular time series of interest represent only a small fraction of all observations. In this context, we frame the problem of training a forecasting model as an imbalanced learning task. Oversampling strategies are popular approaches used to deal with the imbalance problem in machine learning. We use these techniques to create synthetic time series observations and improve the accuracy of forecasting models. We carried out experiments using 7 different databases that contain a total of 5502 univariate time series. We found that the proposed solution outperforms both a global and a local model, thus providing a better trade-off between these two approaches.">

        <tr id="Machine learning models have made significant progress in load forecasting, but their forecast accuracy is limited in cases where historical load data is scarce. Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in computer vision and natural language processing, this paper aims to discuss the potential of large time series models in load forecasting with scarce historical data. Specifically, the large time series model is constructed as a time series generative pre-trained transformer (TimeGPT), which is trained on massive and diverse time series datasets consisting of 100 billion data points (e.g., finance, transportation, banking, web traffic, weather, energy, healthcare, etc.). Then, the scarce historical load data is used to fine-tune the TimeGPT, which helps it to adapt to the data distribution and characteristics associated with load forecasting. Simulation results show that TimeGPT outperforms the benchmarks (e.g., popular machine learning models and statistical models) for load forecasting on several real datasets with scarce training samples, particularly for short look-ahead times. However, it cannot be guaranteed that TimeGPT is always superior to benchmarks for load forecasting with scarce data, since the performance of TimeGPT may be affected by the distribution differences between the load data and the training data. In practical applications, we can divide the historical data into a training set and a validation set, and then use the validation set loss to decide whether TimeGPT is the best choice for a specific dataset.">

This paper presents a new approach: a series of point-in-time LLMs called Time Machine GPT (TiMaGPT), specifically designed to be nonprognosticative. This ensures they remain uninformed about future factual information and linguistic changes. This strategy is beneficial for understanding language evolution and is of critical importance when applying models in dynamic contexts, such as time-series forecasting, where foresight of future information can prove problematic.

        <tr id="There are many time series forecasting methods, but there are few research methods for long-term multivariate time series forecasting, which are mainly dominated by a series of forecasting models developed on the basis of a transformer. The aim of this study is to perform forecasting for multivariate time series data and to improve the forecasting accuracy of the model. In the recent past, it has appeared that the prediction effect of linear models surpasses that of the family of self-attention mechanism models, which encourages us to look for new methods to solve the problem of long-term multivariate time series forecasting. In order to overcome the problem that the temporal order of information is easily broken in the self-attention family and that it is difficult to capture information on long-distance data using recurrent neural network models, we propose a matrix attention mechanism, which is able to weight each previous data point equally without breaking the temporal order of the data, so that the overall data information can be fully utilized. We used the matrix attention mechanism as the basic module to construct the frequency domain block and time domain block. Since complex and variable seasonal component features are difficult to capture in the time domain, mapping them to the frequency domain reduces the complexity of the seasonal components themselves and facilitates data feature extraction. Therefore, we use the frequency domain block to extract the seasonal information with high randomness and poor regularity to help the model capture the local dynamics. The time domain block is used to extract the smooth floating trend component information to help the model capture long-term change patterns. This also improves the overall prediction performance of the model. It is experimentally demonstrated that our model achieves the best prediction results on three public datasets and one private dataset.">

With increasing decentralization, the surge in sensor devices expands the potential vulnerability to cyber attacks. It is imperative to conduct anomaly detection research on the multivariate time series data that these sensors produce to bolster the security of distributed CPSs. However, the high dimensionality, absence of anomaly labels in real-world datasets, and intricate non-linear relationships among sensors present considerable challenges in formulating effective anomaly detection algorithms. Recent deep-learning methods have achieved progress in the field of anomaly detection. Yet, many methods either rely on statistical models that struggle to capture non-linear relationships or use conventional deep learning models like CNN and LSTM, which do not explicitly learn inter-variable correlations. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method that integrates Sparse Autoencoder with Graph Transformer network (SGTrans). SGTrans leverages Sparse Autoencoder for the dimensionality reduction and reconstruction of high-dimensional time series, thus extracting meaningful hidden representations. Then, the multivariate time series are mapped into a graph structure. We introduce a multi-head attention mechanism from Transformer into graph structure learning, constructing a Graph Transformer network forecasting module. This module performs attentive information propagation between long-distance sensor nodes and explicitly models the complex temporal dependencies among them to enhance the prediction of future behaviors. Extensive experiments and evaluations on three publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.">

However, modern methods often yield overconfident and uncalibrated predictions. Various approaches involve training an ensemble of separate models to quantify the uncertainty related to the model itself, known as epistemic uncertainty. In an explicit implementation, the ensemble approach has high computational cost and high memory requirements. This particular challenge is evident in state-of-the-art neural networks such as transformers, where even a single network is already demanding in terms of compute and memory. Consequently, efforts are made to emulate the ensemble model without actually instantiating separate ensemble members, referred to as implicit ensembling. We introduce LoRA-Ensemble, a parameter-efficient deep ensemble method for self-attention networks, which is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Initially developed for efficient LLM fine-tuning, we extend LoRA to an implicit ensembling approach. By employing a single pre-trained self-attention network with weights shared across all members, we train member-specific low-rank matrices for the attention projections. Our method exhibits superior calibration compared to explicit ensembles and achieves similar or better accuracy across various prediction tasks and datasets.">

To tackle this, we propose a distillation framework based on graph knowledge, including a multi-level feature alignment strategy and an attention-guided mechanism to provide a targeted learning trajectory for the student model. We emphasize spectral embedding (SE) as a key technique in our distillation process, which merges the student's feature space with the relational knowledge and structural complexities similar to the teacher network. This method captures the teacher's understanding in a graph-based representation, enabling the student model to more accurately mimic the complex structural dependencies present in the teacher model. Compared to methods that focus only on specific distillation areas, our strategy not only considers key features within the teacher model but also endeavors to capture the relationships and interactions among feature sets, encoding these complex pieces of information into a graph structure to understand and utilize the dynamic relationships among these pieces of information from a global perspective. Experiments show that our method outperforms previous feature distillation methods on the CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Pascal VOC datasets, proving its efficiency and applicability.">

In this article, we leverage conformal prediction, a widely recognized statistical technique for quantifying uncertainty by transforming predictive model outputs into prediction sets, to address uncertainty quantification in GNN predictions amidst conditional shift \footnote{Representing the change in conditional probability distribution $P(label |input)$ from source domain to target domain.} in graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Additionally, we propose a novel loss function aimed at refining model predictions by minimizing conditional shift in latent stages. Termed Conditional Shift Robust (CondSR) conformal prediction for GNNs, our approach CondSR is model-agnostic and adaptable to various classification models. We validate the effectiveness of our method on standard graph benchmark datasets, integrating it with state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification tasks. The code implementation is publicly available for further exploration and experimentation.">

        <tr id="The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), in finance has garnered increasing academic attention. Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering (Q$\&$A), and stock movement prediction (binary classification), with a notable gap in the application of LLMs for financial risk prediction. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce \textbf{RiskLabs}, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely combines different types of financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data surrounding ECC release dates. Our approach involves a multi-stage process: initially extracting and analyzing ECC data using LLMs, followed by gathering and processing time-series data before the ECC dates to model and understand risk over different timeframes. Using multimodal fusion techniques, RiskLabs amalgamates these varied data features for comprehensive multi-task financial risk prediction. Empirical experiment results demonstrate RiskLab's effectiveness in forecasting both volatility and variance in financial markets. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate how different data sources contribute to financial risk assessment and discuss the critical role of LLMs in this context. Our findings not only contribute to the AI in finance application but also open new avenues for applying LLMs in financial risk assessment.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based entropy models have gained prominence in recent years due to their superior ability to capture long-range dependencies in probability distribution estimation compared to convolution-based methods. However, previous transformer-based entropy models suffer from a sluggish coding process due to pixel-wise autoregression or duplicated computation during inference. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based entropy model called GroupedMixer, which enjoys both faster coding speed and better compression performance than previous transformer-based methods. Specifically, our approach builds upon group-wise autoregression by first partitioning the latent variables into groups along spatial-channel dimensions, and then entropy coding the groups with the proposed transformer-based entropy model. The global causal self-attention is decomposed into more efficient group-wise interactions, implemented using inner-group and cross-group token-mixers. The inner-group token-mixer incorporates contextual elements within a group while the cross-group token-mixer interacts with previously decoded groups. Alternate arrangement of two token-mixers enables global contextual reference. To further expedite the network inference, we introduce context cache optimization to GroupedMixer, which caches attention activation values in cross-group token-mixers and avoids complex and duplicated computation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GroupedMixer yields the state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance with fast compression speed.">

        <tr id="While graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the de-facto standard for graph-based node classification, they impose a strong assumption on the availability of sufficient labeled samples. This assumption restricts the classification performance of prevailing GNNs on many real-world applications suffering from low-data regimes. Specifically, features extracted from scarce labeled nodes could not provide sufficient supervision for the unlabeled samples, leading to severe over-fitting. In this work, we point out that leveraging subgraphs to capture long-range dependencies can augment the representation of a node with homophily properties, thus alleviating the low-data regime. However, prior works leveraging subgraphs fail to capture the long-range dependencies among nodes. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised learning framework, called multi-view subgraph neural networks (Muse), for handling long-range dependencies. In particular, we propose an information theory-based identification mechanism to identify two types of subgraphs from the views of input space and latent space, respectively. The former is to capture the local structure of the graph, while the latter captures the long-range dependencies among nodes. By fusing these two views of subgraphs, the learned representations can preserve the topological properties of the graph at large, including the local structure and long-range dependencies, thus maximizing their expressiveness for downstream node classification tasks. Experimental results show that Muse outperforms the alternative methods on node classification tasks with limited labeled data.">

        <tr id="Unmanned surface vehicle (USV)’s motion is represented by time-series data that exhibit highly nonlinear and non-stationary features, significantly influenced by environmental factors, such as wind speed and waves, when sailing on the sea. The accurate prediction of USV motion, particularly crucial parameters, such as the roll angle and pitch angle, is imperative for ensuring safe navigation. However, traditional and single prediction models often struggle with low accuracy and fail to capture the intricate spatial–temporal dependencies among multiple input variables. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a prediction approach integrating temporal convolutional network (TCN) and bi-directional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) models, augmented with a temporal pattern attention (TPA) mechanism, termed the TCN-Bi-LSTM-TPA (TBT) USV motion predictor. This hybrid model effectively combines the strengths of TCN and Bi-LSTM architectures to extract long-term temporal features and bi-directional dependencies. The introduction of the TPA mechanism enhances the model’s capability to extract spatial information, crucial for understanding the intricate interplay of various motion data. By integrating the features extracted by TCN with the output of the attention mechanism, the model incorporates additional contextual information, thereby improving prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conducted experiments using real USV motion data and calculated four evaluation metrics: mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R-squared (R2). The results demonstrate the superior accuracy of the TCN-Bi-LSTM-TPA hybrid model in predicting USV roll angle and pitch angle, validating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of multivariate USV motion prediction.">

Recent developments in Object-Centric Process Mining have enriched event data with objects and their explicit relations between events. To leverage this enriched data, we propose the Heterogeneous Object Event Graph encoding (HOEG), which integrates events and objects into a graph structure with diverse node types. It does so without aggregating object features, thus creating a more nuanced and informative representation. We then adopt a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network architecture, which incorporates these diverse object features in prediction tasks. We evaluate the performance and scalability of HOEG in predicting remaining time, benchmarking it against two established graph-based encodings and two baseline models. Our evaluation uses three Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs), including one from a real-life process at a major Dutch financial institution. The results indicate that HOEG competes well with existing models and surpasses them when OCELs contain informative object attributes and event-object interactions.">

        <tr id="In applications such as biomedical studies, epidemiology, and social sciences, recurrent events often co-occur with longitudinal measurements and a terminal event, such as death. Therefore, jointly modeling longitudinal measurements, recurrent events, and survival data while accounting for their dependencies is critical. While joint models for the three components exist in statistical literature, many of these approaches are limited by heavy parametric assumptions and scalability issues. Recently, incorporating deep learning techniques into joint modeling has shown promising results. However, current methods only address joint modeling of longitudinal measurements at regularly-spaced observation times and survival events, neglecting recurrent events. In this paper, we develop TransformerLSR, a flexible transformer-based deep modeling and inference framework to jointly model all three components simultaneously. TransformerLSR integrates deep temporal point processes into the joint modeling framework, treating recurrent and terminal events as two competing processes dependent on past longitudinal measurements and recurrent event times. Additionally, TransformerLSR introduces a novel trajectory representation and model architecture to potentially incorporate a priori knowledge of known latent structures among concurrent longitudinal variables. We demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of TransformerLSR through simulation studies and analyzing a real-world medical dataset on patients after kidney transplantation.">

However, some current data-driven process monitoring approaches may not fully capitalize on the temporal-spatial correlations inherent in operational MTS data. Particularly, asynchronous time-lagged correlations may exist among variables in actual NPPs, which further complicates this challenge. In this work, a reconstruction-based MTS anomaly detection approach based on a temporal-spatial transformer is proposed. It employs a two-stage temporal-spatial attention mechanism combined with a multi-scale strategy to learn the dependencies within normal operational data at various scales, thereby facilitating the extraction of temporal-spatial correlations from asynchronous MTS. Experiments on simulated datasets and real NPP datasets demonstrate that the proposed model possesses stronger feature learning capabilities, as evidenced by its improved performance in signal reconstruction and anomaly detection for asynchronous MTS data. Moreover, the proposed TS-Trans model enables earlier detection of anomalous events, which holds significant importance for enhancing operational safety and reducing potential losses in NPPs.">

        <tr id="Ensuring both accuracy and robustness in time series prediction is critical to many applications, ranging from urban planning to pandemic management. With sufficient training data where all spatiotemporal patterns are well-represented, existing deep-learning models can make reasonably accurate predictions. However, existing methods fail when the training data are drawn from different circumstances (e.g., traffic patterns on regular days) compared to test data (e.g., traffic patterns after a natural disaster). Such challenges are usually classified under domain generalization. In this work, we show that one way to address this challenge in the context of spatiotemporal prediction is by incorporating domain differential equations into Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). We theoretically derive conditions where GCNs incorporating such domain differential equations are robust to mismatched training and testing data compared to baseline domain agnostic models. To support our theory, we propose two domain-differential-equation-informed networks called Reaction-Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (RDGCN), which incorporates differential equations for traffic speed evolution, and Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered Graph Convolutional Network (SIRGCN), which incorporates a disease propagation model. Both RDGCN and SIRGCN are based on reliable and interpretable domain differential equations that allow the models to generalize to unseen patterns. We experimentally show that RDGCN and SIRGCN are more robust with mismatched testing data than the state-of-the-art deep learning methods.">

However, existing methods usually use separate components to capture spatial and temporal dependence relationship and ignore the heterogeneities in spatial-temporal data which motivates us to capture them together. In this paper, we propose a novel approach STGDNN (short for Spatial-Temporal Graph Deviation Neural Networks) that learns the spatial-temporal dependence relationship together in structure learning of graph neural networks. In addition, we use the learned spatial-temporal graph structure and attention weights to explain the detected anomalies. The experiments on three real world datasets show our superiority in detection accuracy, anomaly diagnosis, and model interpretation compared with state-of-the-art methods.">

        <tr id="Operator learning for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is rapidly emerging as a promising approach for surrogate modeling of intricate systems. Transformers with the self-attention mechanism$\unicode{x2013}$a powerful tool originally designed for natural language processing$\unicode{x2013}$have recently been adapted for operator learning. However, they confront challenges, including high computational demands and limited interpretability. This raises a critical question: Is there a more efficient attention mechanism for Transformer-based operator learning? This paper proposes the Position-induced Transformer (PiT), built on an innovative position-attention mechanism, which demonstrates significant advantages over the classical self-attention in operator learning. Position-attention draws inspiration from numerical methods for PDEs. Different from self-attention, position-attention is induced by only the spatial interrelations of sampling positions for input functions of the operators, and does not rely on the input function values themselves, thereby greatly boosting efficiency. PiT exhibits superior performance over current state-of-the-art neural operators in a variety of complex operator learning tasks across diverse PDE benchmarks. Additionally, PiT possesses an enhanced discretization convergence feature, compared to the widely-used Fourier neural operator.">

        <tr id="Anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MVTS) is a significant research domain across several industries, including cybersecurity and industrial systems. There have been several deep learning-based methods proposed within this research domain. The development of high capacity frameworks has received the majority of attention in recent years due to the availability of large open-source datasets and improvement in computer processing power. However, there has not been much attention in investigating the importance of how the data is presented to these techniques during training. Curriculum learning (CL), a technique based on ordered learning, was proposed for machine learning. In CL, the model first learns from easy data and is progressively trained with increasingly difficult data. In this paper, we propose data-based CL for MVTS anomaly detection. We further introduce the CL concept to the learner (model), in which we first train a simple model and then utilize a complex model in the final training round. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate these approaches in MVTS anomaly detection. We evaluate the proposed designs on the SWaT dataset using the F1 score and the results show an improvement in performance.">

Recently, data-driven weather forecasting models based on deep learning have shown great potential, achieving superior performance compared with traditional numerical weather prediction methods. However, these models often require massive training data and computational resources. In this paper, we propose EWMoE, an effective model for accurate global weather forecasting, which requires significantly less training data and computational resources. Our model incorporates three key components to enhance prediction accuracy: meteorology-specific embedding, a core Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer, and two specific loss functions. We conduct our evaluation on the ERA5 dataset using only two years of training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EWMoE outperforms current models such as FourCastNet and ClimaX at all forecast time, achieving competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art Pangu-Weather model in evaluation metrics such as Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

 Time series forecasting is a well-known deep learning application field in which previous data are used to predict the future behavior of the series. Recently, several deep learning approaches have been proposed in which several nonlinear functions are applied to the input to obtain the output. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to improve the performance of deep learning models in time series forecasting. This method divides the model into hierarchies or levels from simpler to more complex ones. Simpler levels handle smoothed versions of the input, whereas the most complex level processes the original time series. This method follows the human learning process where general/simpler tasks are performed first, and afterward, more precise/harder ones are accomplished. Our proposed methodology has been applied to the LSTM architecture, showing remarkable performance in various time series. In addition, a comparison is reported including a standard LSTM and novel methods such as DeepAR, Temporal Fusion Transformer, NBEATS and Echo State Network.">

        <tr id="Time-series analysis plays a pivotal role across a range of critical applications, from finance to healthcare, which involves various tasks, such as forecasting and classification. To handle the inherent complexities of time-series data, such as high dimensionality and noise, traditional supervised learning methods first annotate extensive labels for time-series data in each task, which is very costly and impractical in real-world applications. In contrast, pre-trained foundation models offer a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data to capture general time series patterns, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, existing approaches to pre-training such models typically suffer from high-bias and low-generality issues due to the use of predefined and rigid augmentation operations and domain-specific data training. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces UniCL, a universal and scalable contrastive learning framework designed for pretraining time-series foundation models across cross-domain datasets. Specifically, we propose a unified and trainable time-series augmentation operation to generate pattern-preserved, diverse, and low-bias time-series data by leveraging spectral information. Besides, we introduce a scalable augmentation algorithm capable of handling datasets with varying lengths, facilitating cross-domain pretraining. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across eleven domains validate the effectiveness of UniCL, demonstrating its high generalization on time-series analysis across various fields.">

Modern neural networks have outstanding ability in modeling complex time series. Self-supervised models in particular tackle unsupervised TSAD by transforming the input via various augmentations to create pseudo anomalies for training. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of augmentation, which is hard to choose in practice, while there exists no effort in the literature on data augmentation tuning for TSAD without labels. Our work aims to fill this gap. We introduce TSAP for TSA"on autoPilot", which can (self-)tune augmentation hyperparameters end-to-end.

Case studies show TSAP's ability to effectively select the (discrete) augmentation type and associated (continuous) hyperparameters.

The accurate prediction of future values in a time series is vital for informed planning and resource allocation. The aim of this study is to explore whether the utilization of seasonal decomposition techniques, such as classical decomposition, X-12-ARIMA, and seasonal decomposition of time series (STL), can improve the effectiveness of time series forecasting models by separating the data into its distinct components, including trend and seasonality. We conduct a comprehensive analysis using real-world time series data, employing popular forecasting models like ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and machine learning-based approaches. By comparing the forecasting accuracy of these models with and without the application of seasonal decomposition techniques, we provide empirical evidence to support the hypothesis. Our research results provide valuable insights into the tangible ad- vantages of integrating seasonal decomposition techniques in time series forecasting, potentially contributing to enhanced decision support systems across diverse application domains.">

However, the majority of current time series causal discovery methods assume stationarity and linear relations in data, making them infeasible for the task. Further, the recent deep learning-based methods rely on the traditional causal structure learning approaches making them computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a Time-Series Causal Neural Network (TS-CausalNN) - a deep learning technique to discover contemporaneous and lagged causal relations simultaneously. Our proposed architecture comprises (i) convolutional blocks comprising parallel custom causal layers, (ii) acyclicity constraint, and (iii) optimization techniques using the augmented Lagrangian approach. In addition to the simple parallel design, an advantage of the proposed model is that it naturally handles the non-stationarity and non-linearity of the data. Through experiments on multiple synthetic and real world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical proficiency of our proposed approach as compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

Among the multitude of methods available for time series forecasting, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model stands out for its simplicity and effectiveness. This paper provides a comprehensive review of ARIMA models, focusing on their application in forecasting time series data. We begin with an overview of time series analysis and the theoretical foundations of ARIMA models. Subsequently, we delve into the process of building and fitting ARIMA models, discussing the steps involved and the considerations for model selection. Furthermore, we explore advanced topics such as seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models and discuss their relevance in handling seasonal data patterns. Additionally, we review recent advancements and extensions of ARIMA models, including hybrid models and machine learning-based approaches. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations associated with ARIMA modeling and provide recommendations for future research directions.">

        <tr id="Missing value imputation is a crucial preprocessing step for many machine learning problems. However, it is often considered as a separate subtask from downstream applications such as classification, regression, or clustering, and thus is not optimized together with them. We hypothesize that treating the imputation model and downstream task model together and optimizing over full pipelines will yield better results than treating them separately. Our work describes a novel AutoML technique for making downstream predictions with missing data that automatically handles preprocessing, model weighting, and selection during inference time, with minimal compute overhead. Specifically we develop M-DEW, a Dynamic missingness-aware Ensemble Weighting (DEW) approach, that constructs a set of two-stage imputation-prediction pipelines, trains each component separately, and dynamically calculates a set of pipeline weights for each sample during inference time. We thus extend previous work on dynamic ensemble weighting to handle missing data at the level of full imputation-prediction pipelines, improving performance and calibration on downstream machine learning tasks over standard model averaging techniques. M-DEW is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art in that it produces statistically significant reductions in model perplexity in 17 out of 18 experiments, while improving average precision in 13 out of 18 experiments.">

However, their complexity and vast volume pose significant challenges to data interpretation and analysis. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), open up new opportunities for researchers in this domain. Although prior studies have demonstrated their potential in language understanding and processing in the context of EHRs, a comprehensive scoping review is lacking. This study aims to bridge this research gap by conducting a scoping review based on 329 related papers collected from OpenAlex. We first performed a bibliometric analysis to examine paper trends, model applications, and collaboration networks. Next, we manually reviewed and categorized each paper into one of the seven identified topics: named entity recognition, information extraction, text similarity, text summarization, text classification, dialogue system, and diagnosis and prediction. For each topic, we discussed the unique capabilities of LLMs, such as their ability to understand context, capture semantic relations, and generate human-like text. Finally, we highlighted several implications for researchers from the perspectives of data resources, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, performance measures, and ethical concerns. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of LLMs to transform EHR research and discusses their applications and ethical considerations.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic prompted governments, institutions, and researchers to investigate its impact, developing strategies based on general indicators to make the most precise predictions possible. Approaches based on epidemiological models were used but the outcomes demonstrated forecasting with uncertainty due to insufficient or missing data. Besides the lack of data, machine-learning models including random forest, support vector regression, LSTM, Auto-encoders, and traditional time-series models such as Prophet and ARIMA were employed in the task, achieving remarkable results with limited effectiveness. Some of these methodologies have precision constraints in dealing with multi-variable inputs, which are important for problems like pandemics that require short and long-term forecasting. Given the under-supply in this scenario, we propose a novel approach for time-series prediction based on stacking auto-encoder structures using three variations of the same model for the training step and weight adjustment to evaluate its forecasting performance. We conducted comparison experiments with previously published data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, temperature, humidity, and air quality index (AQI) in São Paulo City, Brazil. Additionally, we used the percentage of COVID-19 cases from the top ten affected countries worldwide until May 4th, 2020. The results show 80.7% and 10.3% decrease in RMSE to entire and test data over the distribution of 50 trial-trained models, respectively, compared to the first experiment comparison. Also, model type#3 achieved 4th better overall ranking performance, overcoming the NBEATS, Prophet, and Glounts time-series models in the second experiment comparison. This model shows promising forecast capacity and versatility across different input dataset lengths, making it a prominent forecasting model for time-series tasks.">

However, traditional benchmarks, which are often static, fail to capture the continually changing information landscape, leading to a disparity between the perceived and actual effectiveness of LLMs in ever-changing real-world scenarios. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not adequately measure the models' capabilities over a broader temporal range or their adaptability over time. We examine current LLMs in terms of temporal generalization and bias, revealing that various temporal biases emerge in both language likelihood and prognostic prediction. This serves as a caution for LLM practitioners to pay closer attention to mitigating temporal biases. Also, we propose an evaluation framework Freshbench for dynamically generating benchmarks from the most recent real-world prognostication prediction.

To address this need, we constructed a framework for SARS-CoV-2 lineage frequency forecasting (CovTransformer), based on the transformer architecture.

We first trained and tested the model using data from the UK and the US, and then tested the generalization ability of the model on data collected across the globe. Remarkably, the model makes predictions two months into the future with high levels of accuracy in 31 countries.

Transformer, as one kind of the cutting-edge deep learning methods, offers an effective approach to model intricate nonlinear processes, enables the extraction of key features and water level predictions. EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods play important roles in enhancing the understandings of how different factors impact water level. In this study, we propose a Transformer variant by integrating sparse attention mechanism and introducing nonlinear output layer for the decoder module. The variant model is utilized for multi-step forecasting of water level, by considering meteorological and hydrological factors simultaneously. It is shown that the variant model outperforms traditional Transformer across different lead times with respect to various evaluation metrics. The sensitivity analyses based on XAI technology demonstrate the significant influence of meteorological factors on water level evolution, in which temperature is shown to be the most dominant meteorological factor. Therefore, incorporating both meteorological and hydrological factors is necessary for reliable hydrological prediction and flood prevention. In the meantime, XAI technology provides insights into certain predictions, which is beneficial for understanding the prediction results and evaluating the reasonability.">

The objective of this study is to determine an effective approach for managing time series data characterized by volatility and missing values.

Predicting future traffic conditionsis a difficult undertaking because of the intricate spatio-temporal relationships involved. Existing techniques often employ separate modules to model spatio-temporal features independently, thereby neglecting the temporally and spatially heterogeneous features among nodes. Simultaneously, many existing methods overlook the long-term relationships included in traffic data, subsequently impacting prediction accuracy. We introduce a novel method to traffic flow forecasting based on the combination of the feature-augmented down-sampling dynamic graph convolutional network and multi-head attention mechanism. Our method presents a feature augmentation mechanism to integrate traffic data features at different scales. The subsampled convolutional network enhances information interaction in spatio-temporal data, and the dynamic graph convolutional network utilizes the generated graph structure to better simulate the dynamic relationships between nodes, enhancing the model’s capacity for capturing spatial heterogeneity. Through the feature-enhanced subsampled dynamic graph convolutional network, the model can simultaneously capture spatio-temporal dependencies, and coupled with the process of multi-head temporal attention, it achieves long-term traffic flow forecasting. The findings demonstrate that the ADDGCN model demonstrates superior prediction capabilities on two real datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08). Notably, for the PEMS04 dataset, compared to the best baseline, the performance of ADDGCN is improved by 2.46% in MAE and 2.90% in RMSE; for the PEMS08 dataset, compared to the best baseline, the ADDGCN performance is improved by 1.50% in RMSE, 3.46% in MAE, and 0.21% in MAPE, indicating our method’s superior performance.">

        <tr id="Data Augmentation is a common technique used to enhance the performance of deep learning models by expanding the training dataset. Automatic Data Augmentation (ADA) methods are getting popular because of their capacity to generate policies for various datasets. However, existing ADA methods primarily focused on overall performance improvement, neglecting the problem of class-dependent bias that leads to performance reduction in specific classes. This bias poses significant challenges when deploying models in real-world applications. Furthermore, ADA for time series remains an underexplored domain, highlighting the need for advancements in this field. In particular, applying ADA techniques to vital signals like an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a compelling example due to its potential in medical domains such as heart disease diagnostics. We propose a novel deep learning-based approach called Class-dependent Automatic Adaptive Policies (CAAP) framework to overcome the notable class-dependent bias problem while maintaining the overall improvement in time-series data augmentation. Specifically, we utilize the policy network to generate effective sample-wise policies with balanced difficulty through class and feature information extraction. Second, we design the augmentation probability regulation method to minimize class-dependent bias. Third, we introduce the information region concepts into the ADA framework to preserve essential regions in the sample. Through a series of experiments on real-world ECG datasets, we demonstrate that CAAP outperforms representative methods in achieving lower class-dependent bias combined with superior overall performance. These results highlight the reliability of CAAP as a promising ADA method for time series modeling that fits for the demands of real-world applications.">

        <tr id="Although recent advances in machine learning have shown its success to learn from independent and identically distributed (IID) data, it is vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) data in an open world. Domain generalization (DG) deals with such an issue and it aims to learn a model from multiple source domains that can be generalized to unseen target domains. Existing studies on DG have largely focused on stationary settings with homogeneous source domains. However, in many applications, domains may evolve along a specific direction (e.g., time, space). Without accounting for such non-stationary patterns, models trained with existing methods may fail to generalize on OOD data. In this paper, we study domain generalization in non-stationary environment. We first examine the impact of environmental non-stationarity on model performance and establish the theoretical upper bounds for the model error at target domains. Then, we propose a novel algorithm based on adaptive invariant representation learning, which leverages the non-stationary pattern to train a model that attains good performance on target domains. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed algorithm.">

        <tr id="Today, the acquisition of various behavioral log data has enabled deeper understanding of customer preferences and future behaviors in the marketing field. In particular, multimodal deep learning has achieved highly accurate predictions by combining multiple types of data. Many of these studies utilize with feature fusion to construct multimodal models, which combines extracted representations from each modality. However, since feature fusion treats information from each modality equally, it is difficult to perform flexible analysis such as the attention mechanism that has been used extensively in recent years. Therefore, this study proposes a context-aware multimodal deep learning model that combines Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and cross-attention Transformer, which dynamically changes the attention of deep-contextualized word representations based on background information such as consumer demographic and lifestyle variables. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by comparing it with six reference models in three categories using behavioral logs stored on an online platform. In addition, we present an efficient multimodal learning method by comparing the learning efficiency depending on the optimizers and the prediction accuracy depending on the number of tokens in the text data.">

We ask these models to generate $200$ time-ahead predictions of two datasets coming from a numerical simulation and experimental measurements, where the latter is characterized by being turbulent. We show how the hybrid model generates more reliable predictions in the experimental case, as it is physics-informed in the sense that the modal decomposition extracts the physics in a way that allows us to predict it.">

        <tr id="Stochastic video prediction enables the consideration of uncertainty in future motion, thereby providing a better reflection of the dynamic nature of the environment. Stochastic video prediction methods based on image auto-regressive recurrent models need to feed their predictions back into the latent space. Conversely, the state-space models, which decouple frame synthesis and temporal prediction, proves to be more efficient. However, inferring long-term temporal information about motion and generalizing to dynamic scenarios under non-stationary assumptions remains an unresolved challenge. In this paper, we propose a state-space decomposition stochastic video prediction model that decomposes the overall video frame generation into deterministic appearance prediction and stochastic motion prediction. Through adaptive decomposition, the model's generalization capability to dynamic scenarios is enhanced. In the context of motion prediction, obtaining a prior on the long-term trend of future motion is crucial. Thus, in the stochastic motion prediction branch, we infer the long-term motion trend from conditional frames to guide the generation of future frames that exhibit high consistency with the conditional frames. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines on multiple datasets.">

This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go. NKDCD also utilizes sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights of the lag matrices, encouraging the model to select only the needed causal dependencies within the data. Through extensive testing on practically applicable datasets, it is shown that the NKDCD outperforms the existing nonlinear Granger causality discovery approaches.">

While machine learning has proven its capabilities in generalizing the underlying non-linear dynamics of such systems, unlocking its predictive power is often restrained by the limited availability of large, curated datasets. To supplement real-world data, informing machine learning by transfer learning with data simulated from ordinary differential equations has emerged as a promising solution. However, the success of this approach highly depends on the designed characteristics of the synthetic data. Results We optimize dataset characteristics such as size, diversity, and noise of ordinary differential equation-based synthetic time series datasets in three relevant and representative biological systems. To achieve this, we here, for the first time, present a framework to systematically evaluate the influence of such design choices on transfer learning performance in one place. We achieve a performance improvement of up to 92% in mean absolute error for our optimized simulation-based transfer learning compared to non-informed deep learning. We find a strong interdependency between dataset size and diversity effects. The optimal transfer learning setting heavily relies on real-world data characteristics as well as its coherence with the synthetic data’s dynamics, emphasizing the relevance of such a framework.

However, accurately portraying the performance of DLP algorithms poses challenges that might impede progress in the field. Importantly, common evaluation pipelines usually calculate ranking or binary classification metrics, where the scores of observed interactions (positives) are compared with those of randomly generated ones (negatives). However, a single metric is not sufficient to fully capture the differences between DLP algorithms, and is prone to overly optimistic performance evaluation. Instead, an in-depth evaluation should reflect performance variations across different nodes, edges, and time segments. In this work, we contribute tools to perform such a comprehensive evaluation.

(2) We describe an exhaustive taxonomy of negative sampling methods that can be used at evaluation time. (3) We carry out an empirical study of the effect of the different negative sampling strategies. Our comparison between heuristics and state-of-the-art memory-based methods on various real-world datasets confirms a strong effect of using different negative sampling strategies on the test area under the curve (AUC).

This study aims to leverage an Explainable AI approach, counterfactual explanations, to enhance the explainability and usability of deep learning-based traffic forecasting models. Specifically, the goal is to elucidate relationships between various input contextual features and their corresponding predictions. We present a comprehensive framework that generates counterfactual explanations for traffic forecasting and provides usable insights through the proposed scenario-driven counterfactual explanations. The study first implements a deep learning model to predict traffic speed based on historical traffic data and contextual variables. Counterfactual explanations are then used to illuminate how alterations in these input variables affect predicted outcomes, thereby enhancing the transparency of the deep learning model. We investigated the impact of contextual features on traffic speed prediction under varying spatial and temporal conditions. The scenario-driven counterfactual explanations integrate two types of user-defined constraints, directional and weighting constraints, to tailor the search for counterfactual explanations to specific use cases. These tailored explanations benefit machine learning practitioners who aim to understand the model's learning mechanisms and domain experts who seek insights for real-world applications. The results showcase the effectiveness of counterfactual explanations in revealing traffic patterns learned by deep learning models, showing its potential for interpreting black-box deep learning models used for spatiotemporal predictions in general.">

        <tr id="In the era of data‐driven transportation development, traffic forecasting is crucial. Established studies either ignore the inherent spatial structure of the traffic network or ignore the global spatial correlation and may not capture the spatial relationships adequately. In this work, a Dynamic Spatial‐Temporal Network (DSTN) based on Joint Latent Space Representation (JLSR) is proposed for traffic forecasting. Specifically, in the spatial dimension, a JLSR network is developed by integrating graph convolution and spatial attention operations to model complex spatial dependencies. Since it can adaptively fuse the representation information of local topological space and global dynamic space, a more comprehensive spatial dependency can be captured. In the temporal dimension, a Stacked Bidirectional Unidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (SBUGRU) network is developed, which captures long‐term temporal dependencies through both forward and backward computations and superimposed recurrent layers. On these bases, DSTN is developed in an encoder‐decoder framework and periodicity is flexibly modeled by embedding branches. The performance of DSTN is validated on two types of real‐world traffic flow datasets, and it improves over baselines.">

        <tr id="Time series are generated in diverse domains such as economic, traffic, health, and energy, where forecasting of future values has numerous important applications. Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The benchmark code and data are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB.">

        <tr id="Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed NLP with their remarkable In-context Learning (ICL) capabilities. Automated assistants based on LLMs are gaining popularity; however, adapting them to novel tasks is still challenging. While colossal models excel in zero-shot performance, their computational demands limit widespread use, and smaller language models struggle without context. This paper investigates whether LLMs can generalize from labeled examples of predefined tasks to novel tasks. Drawing inspiration from biological neurons and the mechanistic interpretation of the Transformer architecture, we explore the potential for information sharing across tasks. We design a cross-task prompting setup with three LLMs and show that LLMs achieve significant performance improvements despite no examples from the target task in the context. Cross-task prompting leads to a remarkable performance boost of 107% for LLaMA-2 7B, 18.6% for LLaMA-2 13B, and 3.2% for GPT 3.5 on average over zero-shot prompting, and performs comparable to standard in-context learning. The effectiveness of generating pseudo-labels for in-task examples is demonstrated, and our analyses reveal a strong correlation between the effect of cross-task examples and model activation similarities in source and target input tokens. This paper offers a first-of-its-kind exploration of LLMs' ability to solve novel tasks based on contextual signals from different task examples.">

A well-established paradigm in AI-driven time series prediction is injecting physical knowledge into neural networks through signal decomposition methods, and sustaining progress in numerous scenarios has been reported. However, we uncover non-negligible evidence that challenges the effectiveness of signal decomposition in AI-based time series prediction. We confirm that improper dataset processing with subtle future label leakage is unfortunately widely adopted, possibly yielding abnormally superior but misleading results. By processing data in a strictly causal way without any future information, the effectiveness of additional decomposed signals diminishes.

We study 6 MLLMs, including masked language models, autoregressive models, and instruction-tuned LLMs, on the SIB-200 dataset, a topic classification dataset encompassing 204 languages. Our analysis considers three scenarios: ALL languages, SEEN languages (present in the model's pretraining data), and UNSEEN languages (not present or documented in the model's pretraining data in any meaningful way). We examine the impact of factors such as pretraining data size, general resource availability, language family, and script type on model performance. Decision tree analysis reveals that pretraining data size is the most influential factor for SEEN languages. However, interestingly, script type and language family are crucial for UNSEEN languages, highlighting the importance of cross-lingual transfer learning. Notably, model size and architecture do not significantly alter the most important features identified. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current MLLMs and hope to guide the development of more effective and equitable multilingual NLP systems.">

We propose a novel framework that combines the strengths of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Bayesian inference. The framework utilizes a Conditional GAN (C-GAN) to realistically impute missing values in the time series data. Subsequently, Bayesian inference is employed to quantify the uncertainty associated with the forecasts due to the missing data. This combined approach improves the robustness and reliability of forecasting compared to traditional methods. The effectiveness of our proposed method is evaluated on a real-world dataset of air pollution data from Mexico City. The results demonstrate the framework’s capability to handle missing data and achieve improved forecasting accuracy.">

        <tr id="Real-life time series datasets exhibit complications that hinder the study of time series forecasting (TSF). These datasets inherently exhibit non-stationarity as their distributions vary over time. Furthermore, the intricate inter- and intra-series relationships among data points pose challenges for modeling. Many existing TSF models overlook one or both of these issues, resulting in inaccurate forecasts. This study proposes a novel TSF model designed to address the challenges posed by real-life data, delivering accurate forecasts in both multivariate and univariate settings. First, we propose methods termed “weak-stationarizing” and “non-stationarity restoring” to mitigate distributional shift. These methods enable the removal and restoration of non-stationary components from individual data points as needed. Second, we utilize the spectral decomposition of weak-stationary time series to extract informative features for forecasting. To learn features from the spectral decomposition of weak-stationary time series, we exploit a mixer architecture to find inter- and intra-series dependencies from the unraveled representation of the overall time series. To ensure the efficacy of our model, we conduct comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art models using six real-world datasets spanning diverse fields. Across each dataset, our model consistently outperforms or yields comparable results to existing models.">

        <tr id="High-dimensional longitudinal time series data is prevalent across various real-world applications. Many such applications can be modeled as regression problems with high-dimensional time series covariates. Deep learning has been a popular and powerful tool for fitting these regression models. Yet, the development of interpretable and reproducible deep-learning models is challenging and remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel method, Deep Learning Inference using Knockoffs for Time series data (DeepLINK-T), focusing on the selection of significant time series variables in regression while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a predetermined level. DeepLINK-T combines deep learning with knockoff inference to control FDR in feature selection for time series models, accommodating a wide variety of feature distributions. It addresses dependencies across time and features by leveraging a time-varying latent factor structure in time series covariates. Three key ingredients for DeepLINK-T are 1) a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder for generating time series knockoff variables, 2) an LSTM prediction network using both original and knockoff variables, and 3) the application of the knockoffs framework for variable selection with FDR control. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate DeepLINK-T's performance, showing its capability to control FDR effectively while demonstrating superior feature selection power for high-dimensional longitudinal time series data compared to its non-time series counterpart. DeepLINK-T is further applied to three metagenomic data sets, validating its practical utility and effectiveness, and underscoring its potential in real-world applications.">

        <tr id="Early and timely prediction of patient care demand not only affects effective resource allocation but also influences clinical decision-making as well as patient experience. Accurately predicting patient care demand, however, is a ubiquitous challenge for hospitals across the world due, in part, to the demand's time-varying temporal variability, and, in part, to the difficulty in modelling trends in advance. To address this issue, here, we develop two methods, a relatively simple time-vary linear model, and a more advanced neural network model. The former forecasts patient arrivals hourly over a week based on factors such as day of the week and previous 7-day arrival patterns. The latter leverages a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, capturing non-linear relationships between past data and a three-day forecasting window. We evaluate the predictive capabilities of the two proposed approaches compared to two na\"ive approaches - a reduced-rank vector autoregressive (VAR) model and the TBATS model. Using patient care demand data from Rambam Medical Center in Israel, our results show that both proposed models effectively capture hourly variations of patient demand. Additionally, the linear model is more explainable thanks to its simple architecture, whereas, by accurately modelling weekly seasonal trends, the LSTM model delivers lower prediction errors. Taken together, our explorations suggest the utility of machine learning in predicting time-varying patient care demand; additionally, it is possible to predict patient care demand with good accuracy (around 4 patients) three days or a week in advance using machine learning.">

Specifically, CFLUE provides datasets tailored for both knowledge assessment and application assessment. In knowledge assessment, it consists of 38K+ multiple-choice questions with associated solution explanations. These questions serve dual purposes: answer prediction and question reasoning. In application assessment, CFLUE features 16K+ test instances across distinct groups of NLP tasks such as text classification, machine translation, relation extraction, reading comprehension, and text generation. Upon CFLUE, we conduct a thorough evaluation of representative LLMs. The results reveal that only GPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo achieve an accuracy exceeding 60\% in answer prediction for knowledge assessment, suggesting that there is still substantial room for improvement in current LLMs. In application assessment, although GPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo are the top two performers, their considerable advantage over lightweight LLMs is noticeably diminished.

        <tr id="Forecast reconciliation has attracted significant research interest in recent years, with most studies taking the hierarchy of time series as given. We extend existing work that uses time series clustering to construct hierarchies, with the goal of improving forecast accuracy, in three ways. First, we investigate multiple approaches to clustering, including not only different clustering algorithms, but also the way time series are represented and how distance between time series is defined. We find that cluster-based hierarchies lead to improvements in forecast accuracy relative to two-level hierarchies. Second, we devise an approach based on random permutation of hierarchies, keeping the structure of the hierarchy fixed, while time series are randomly allocated to clusters. In doing so, we find that improvements in forecast accuracy that accrue from using clustering do not arise from grouping together similar series but from the structure of the hierarchy. Third, we propose an approach based on averaging forecasts across hierarchies constructed using different clustering methods, that is shown to outperform any single clustering method. All analysis is carried out on two benchmark datasets and a simulated dataset. Our findings provide new insights into the role of hierarchy construction in forecast reconciliation and offer valuable guidance on forecasting practice.">

However, this framework might suffer from the problem of posterior collapse when applied to time series. In this paper, we conduct an impact analysis of this problem. With a theoretical insight, we first explain that posterior collapse reduces latent diffusion to a VAE, making it less expressive. Then, we introduce the notion of dependency measures, showing that the latent variable sampled from the diffusion model loses control of the generation process in this situation and that latent diffusion exhibits dependency illusion in the case of shuffled time series. We also analyze the causes of posterior collapse and introduce a new framework based on this analysis, which addresses the problem and supports a more expressive prior distribution. Our experiments on various real-world time-series datasets demonstrate that our new model maintains a stable posterior and outperforms the baselines in time series generation.">

In this paper, we propose a method that combines advanced machine learning with rigorous time series analysis to improve prediction accuracy by integrating different datasets, providing a prescriptive example for passenger flow prediction in urban rail transit systems. The study employs advanced machine learning algorithms and proposes a novel prediction model that combines two-stage decomposition (seasonal and trend decomposition using LOESS–ensemble empirical mode decomposition (STL-EEMD)) and gated recurrent units. First, the STL decomposition algorithm is applied to break down the preprocessed data into trend terms, periodic terms, and irregular fluctuation terms. Then, the EEMD decomposition algorithm is employed to further decompose the irregular fluctuation terms, yielding multiple IMF components and residual residuals. Subsequently, the decomposed data from STL and EEMD are partitioned into training and test sets and normalized. The training set is utilized to train the model for optimal performance in predicting subway short-time passenger flow. The synthesis of these sophisticated methodologies serves to substantially enhance both the predictive precision and the broad applicability of the forecasting models. The efficacy of the proposed approach is rigorously evaluated through its application to empirical metro passenger flow datasets from diverse urban centers, demonstrating marked superiority in predictive performance over traditional forecasting methods. The insights gleaned from this study bear significant ramifications for the strategic planning and administration of public transportation infrastructures, potentially leading to more strategic resource allocation and an enhanced commuter experience.">

        <tr id="Causality reveals fundamental principles behind data distributions in real-world scenarios, and the capability of large language models (LLMs) to understand causality directly impacts their efficacy across explaining outputs, adapting to new evidence, and generating counterfactuals. With the proliferation of LLMs, the evaluation of this capacity is increasingly garnering attention. However, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark has rendered existing evaluation studies being straightforward, undiversified, and homogeneous. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark, namely CausalBench, to evaluate the causality understanding capabilities of LLMs. Originating from the causal research community, CausalBench encompasses three causal learning-related tasks, which facilitate a convenient comparison of LLMs' performance with classic causal learning algorithms. Meanwhile, causal networks of varying scales and densities are integrated in CausalBench, to explore the upper limits of LLMs' capabilities across task scenarios of varying difficulty. Notably, background knowledge and structured data are also incorporated into CausalBench to thoroughly unlock the underlying potential of LLMs for long-text comprehension and prior information utilization. Based on CausalBench, this paper evaluates nineteen leading LLMs and unveils insightful conclusions in diverse aspects. Firstly, we present the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs and quantitatively explore the upper limits of their capabilities across various scenarios. Meanwhile, we further discern the adaptability and abilities of LLMs to specific structural networks and complex chain of thought structures. Moreover, this paper quantitatively presents the differences across diverse information sources and uncovers the gap between LLMs' capabilities in causal understanding within textual contexts and numerical domains.">

These models are CNN and RNN, which include two models (Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).

        <tr id="Prompting techniques have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various complex tasks, including reasoning, planning, and solving math word problems. However, most research has predominantly focused on language-based reasoning and word problems, often overlooking the potential of LLMs in handling symbol-based calculations and reasoning. This study aims to bridge this gap by rigorously evaluating LLMs on a series of symbolic tasks, such as addition, multiplication, modulus arithmetic, numerical precision, and symbolic counting. Our analysis encompasses eight LLMs, including four enterprise-grade and four open-source models, of which three have been pre-trained on mathematical tasks. The assessment framework is anchored in Chomsky's Hierarchy, providing a robust measure of the computational abilities of these models. The evaluation employs minimally explained prompts alongside the zero-shot Chain of Thoughts technique, allowing models to navigate the solution process autonomously. The findings reveal a significant decline in LLMs' performance on context-free and context-sensitive symbolic tasks as the complexity, represented by the number of symbols, increases. Notably, even the fine-tuned GPT3.5 exhibits only marginal improvements, mirroring the performance trends observed in other models. Across the board, all models demonstrated a limited generalization ability on these symbol-intensive tasks. This research underscores LLMs' challenges with increasing symbolic complexity and highlights the need for specialized training, memory and architectural adjustments to enhance their proficiency in symbol-based reasoning tasks.">

        <tr id="Time series anomaly detection is a critical machine learning task for numerous applications, such as finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. However, even high-performed models may exhibit potential issues such as biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable insights to detect such issues by elucidating model attributions of their decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and not scalable across dataset, and they provide one-directional information from the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation with two time series datasets and user studies demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD in fostering a deeper human understanding, immediate corrective actions, and the reliability enhancement of models.">

        <tr id="Multiple clustering has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to reveal multiple hidden structures of data from different perspectives. The advent of deep multiple clustering techniques has notably advanced the performance by uncovering complex patterns and relationships within large datasets. However, a major challenge arises as users often do not need all the clusterings that algorithms generate, and figuring out the one needed requires a substantial understanding of each clustering result. Traditionally, aligning a user's brief keyword of interest with the corresponding vision components was challenging, but the emergence of multi-modal and large language models (LLMs) has begun to bridge this gap. In response, given unlabeled target visual data, we propose Multi-MaP, a novel method employing a multi-modal proxy learning process. It leverages CLIP encoders to extract coherent text and image embeddings, with GPT-4 integrating users' interests to formulate effective textual contexts. Moreover, reference word constraint and concept-level constraint are designed to learn the optimal text proxy according to the user's interest. Multi-MaP not only adeptly captures a user's interest via a keyword but also facilitates identifying relevant clusterings. Our extensive experiments show that Multi-MaP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all benchmark multi-clustering vision tasks.

The forecast uncertainty, particularly for precipitation, serves as a crucial indicator of the reliability of deterministic forecasts. Traditionally, forecast uncertainty is estimated by ensemble forecasting, which is computationally expensive since the forecast model is run multiple times with perturbations. Recently, deep learning methods have been explored to learn the statistical properties of ensemble prediction systems due to their low computational costs. However, accurately and effectively capturing the uncertainty information in precipitation forecasts remains challenging. In this study, we present a novel spatiotemporal transformer network (ST-TransNet) as an alternative approach to estimate uncertainty with ensemble spread and probabilistic forecasts, by learning from historical ensemble forecasts. ST-TransNet features a hierarchical structure for extracting multiscale features and incorporates a spatiotemporal transformer module with window-based attention to capture correlations in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, window-based attention can not only extract local precipitation patterns but also reduce computational costs. The proposed ST-TransNet is evaluated on the TIGGE ensemble forecast dataset and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation products. Results show that ST-TransNet outperforms both traditional and deep learning methods across various metrics. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to generate reasonable and accurate spread and probability forecasts from a single deterministic precipitation forecast. It demonstrates the capacity and efficiency of neural networks in estimating precipitation forecast uncertainty.">

Learning from graph streams becomes a necessity to understand the dynamics of graph structures and to facilitate informed decision-making. This work introduces a novel method for graph stream classification which operates under the general setting where a data generating process produces graphs with varying nodes and edges over time. The method uses incremental learning for continual model adaptation, selecting representative graphs (prototypes) for each class, and creating graph embeddings.

This paper focuses on temporal shifts in social media and, in particular, Twitter. We propose a unified evaluation scheme to assess the performance of language models (LMs) under temporal shift on standard social media tasks. LMs are tested on five diverse social media NLP tasks under different temporal settings, which revealed two important findings: (i) the decrease in performance under temporal shift is consistent across different models for entity-focused tasks such as named entity recognition or disambiguation, and hate speech detection, but not significant in the other tasks analysed (i.e., topic and sentiment classification); and (ii) continuous pre-training on the test period does not improve the temporal adaptability of LMs.">

This study outlines the development of a novel method for zero-shot/few-shot in-context learning (ICL) by integrating medical domain knowledge using a multi-layered structured prompt. We also explore the efficacy of two communication styles between the user and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data incrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which employs long narrative prompts. Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors, including gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient records in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional clinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when employing few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as sources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased number of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the performance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior cost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models. This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored communication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training examples and communication styles to improve accuracy and reduce biases in LLM applications.">

Deep learning-based TSF tasks stand out as one of the most valuable AI scenarios for research, playing an important role in explaining complex real-world phenomena. However, deep learning models still face challenges: they need to deal with the challenge of large-scale data in the information age, achieve longer forecasting ranges, reduce excessively high computational complexity, etc. Therefore, novel methods and more effective solutions are essential.

We begin by introducing the recent development trends in the field of TSF and then propose a new taxonomy from the perspective of deep neural network models, comprehensively covering articles published over the past five years. We also organize commonly used experimental evaluation metrics and datasets. Finally, we point out current issues with the existing solutions and suggest promising future directions in the field of deep learning combined with TSF.

        <tr id="Abstract. Current multi-epoch InSAR techniques heavily rely on the assumption of linear deformation. This can sometimes overlook crucial deformation signals when using velocities for evaluation. The process of interpreting InSAR time series is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also requires a certain level of expertise. This study refines existing InSAR deformation categories, such as stable, linear, step, piecewise linear, power, and undefined, to define 'canonical deformation time series patterns.' We propose an innovative approach for InSAR post-processing using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and transfer learning. Due to the limited availability of real data, we use simulated data to train a pre-existing model. We then assess the effectiveness of our method in identifying urban deformation patterns. This research could significantly improve our understanding of large-scale InSAR time series deformation and reveal the underlying patterns.

        <tr id="Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in practically every task in this field. However, the prevalent approach used in text generation, Causal Language Modelling (CLM), which generates text sequentially from left to right, inherently limits the freedom of the model, which does not decide when and where each token is generated. In contrast, Masked Language Modelling (MLM), primarily used for language understanding tasks, can generate tokens anywhere in the text and any order. This paper conducts an extensive comparison of MLM and CLM approaches for text generation tasks. To do so, we pre-train several language models of comparable sizes on three different datasets, namely 1) medical discharge summaries, 2) movie plot synopses, and 3) authorship verification datasets. To assess the quality of the generations, we first employ quantitative metrics and then perform a qualitative human evaluation to analyse coherence and grammatical correctness. In addition, we evaluate the usefulness of the generated texts by using them in three different downstream tasks: 1) Entity Recognition, 2) Text Classification, and 3) Authorship Verification. The results show that MLM consistently outperforms CLM in text generation across all datasets, with higher quantitative scores and better coherence in the generated text. The study also finds \textit{no strong correlation} between the quality of the generated text and the performance of the models in the downstream tasks. With this study, we show that MLM for text generation has great potential for future research and provides direction for future studies in this area.">

        <tr id="The Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model offers a general framework for capturing dynamics and predicting transition points in diverse natural and social systems. In this work, we present two calibration techniques for the LPPLS model using deep learning. First, we introduce the Mono-LPPLS-NN (M-LNN) model; for any given empirical time series, a unique M-LNN model is trained and shown to outperform state-of-the-art techniques in estimating the nonlinear parameters $(t_c, m, \omega)$ of the LPPLS model as evidenced by the comprehensive distribution of parameter errors. Second, we extend the M-LNN model to a more general model architecture, the Poly-LPPLS-NN (P-LNN), which is able to quickly estimate the nonlinear parameters of the LPPLS model for any given time-series of a fixed length, including previously unseen time-series during training. The Poly class of models train on many synthetic LPPLS time-series augmented with various noise structures in a supervised manner. Given enough training examples, the P-LNN models also outperform state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the parameters of the LPPLS model as evidenced by the comprehensive distribution of parameter errors. Additionally, this class of models is shown to substantially reduce the time to obtain parameter estimates. Finally, we present applications to the diagnostic and prediction of two financial bubble peaks (followed by their crash) and of a famous rockslide. These contributions provide a bridge between deep learning and the study of the prediction of transition times in complex time series.">

        <tr id="Adapting to concept drift is a challenging task in machine learning, which is usually tackled using incremental learning techniques that periodically re-fit a learning model leveraging newly available data. A primary limitation of these techniques is their reliance on substantial amounts of data for retraining. The necessity of acquiring fresh data introduces temporal delays prior to retraining, potentially rendering the models inaccurate if a sudden concept drift occurs in-between two consecutive retrainings. In communication networks, such issue emerges when performing traffic forecasting following a~failure event: post-failure re-routing may induce a drastic shift in distribution and pattern of traffic data, thus requiring a timely model adaptation. In this work, we address this challenge for the problem of traffic forecasting and propose an approach that exploits adaptive learning algorithms, namely, liquid neural networks, which are capable of self-adaptation to abrupt changes in data patterns without requiring any retraining. Through extensive simulations of failure scenarios, we compare the predictive performance of our proposed approach to that of a reference method based on incremental learning. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms incremental learning-based methods in situations where the shifts in traffic patterns are drastic.">

To meet these performance demands, we propose a novel backbone from the perspective of information fusion. Introducing the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module and the Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN), based on evidence theory, allows us to achieve superior performance. On the other hand, the perspective of multi-source information fusion effectively improves the accuracy of forecasting. Due to the fact that BPA is generated by fuzzy theory, TEFN also has considerable interpretability. In real data experiments, the TEFN partially achieved state-of-the-art, with low errors comparable to PatchTST, and operating efficiency surpass performance models such as Dlinear. Meanwhile, TEFN has high robustness and small error fluctuations in the random hyperparameter selection. TEFN is not a model that achieves the ultimate in single aspect, but a model that balances performance, accuracy, stability, and interpretability.">

        <tr id="The graph neural network (GNN) has shown outstanding performance in processing unstructured data. However, the downstream task performance of GNN strongly depends on the accuracy of data graph structural features and, as a type of deep learning (DL) model, the size of the training dataset is equally crucial to its performance. This paper is based on graph neural networks to predict and complete the target radio environment map (REM) through multiple complete REMs and sparse spectrum monitoring data in the target domain. Due to the complexity of radio wave propagation in space, it is difficult to accurately and explicitly construct the spatial graph structure of the spectral data. In response to the two above issues, we propose a multi-source domain adaptive of GNN for regression (GNN-MDAR) model, which includes two key modules: (1) graph structure alignment modules are used to capture and learn graph structure information shared by cross-domain radio propagation and extract reliable graph structure information for downstream reference signal receiving power (RSRP) prediction task; and (2) a spatial distribution matching module is used to reduce the feature distribution mismatch across spatial grids and improve the model’s ability to remain domain invariant. Based on the measured REMs dataset, the comparative results of simulation experiments show that the GNN-MDAR outperforms the other four benchmark methods in accuracy when there is less RSRP label data in the target domain.">

        <tr id="The necessity for interpretability in natural language processing (NLP) has risen alongside the growing prominence of large language models. Among the myriad tasks within NLP, text generation stands out as a primary objective of autoregressive models. The NLP community has begun to take a keen interest in gaining a deeper understanding of text generation, leading to the development of model-agnostic explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods tailored to this task. The design and evaluation of explainability methods are non-trivial since they depend on many factors involved in the text generation process, e.g., the autoregressive model and its stochastic nature. This paper outlines 17 challenges categorized into three groups that arise during the development and assessment of attribution-based explainability methods. These challenges encompass issues concerning tokenization, defining explanation similarity, determining token importance and prediction change metrics, the level of human intervention required, and the creation of suitable test datasets. The paper illustrates how these challenges can be intertwined, showcasing new opportunities for the community. These include developing probabilistic word-level explainability methods and engaging humans in the explainability pipeline, from the data design to the final evaluation, to draw robust conclusions on xAI methods.">

The model architecture incorporates primary and intermediate neurons tasked with capturing and transmitting rhythmic information. Two parameter matrices, denoted as c and k, regulate the reservoir's overall dynamics. We propose a loss function to adapt c post-training and introduce a dynamic selection (DS) mechanism that adjusts $k$ to focus on areas with outstanding contributions. Experimental results on a diverse test set showcase accurate predictions, further improved through real-time tuning of the reservoir via c and k.

The proposed model in this study employs LSTM networks, Encoder-Decoder framework, as well as feedback and attention mechanism to effectively utilize diverse observed data and future rainfall as inputs for multiple time steps flood forecasting. The accuracy and reliability of the model have been validated across case studies in multiple watersheds in China. The results demonstrate the high performance of the LSTM-based flood forecasting model.

        <tr id="This study introduces an innovative deep learning model, Residual-EnDecode-Feedforward Attention Mechanism-Long Short-Term Memory (REDF-LSTM), designed to overcome the high uncertainty challenges faced by traditional soil moisture prediction methods. The REDF-LSTM model, by integrating a residual learning encoder–decoder LSTM layer, enhanced LSTM layers, and feedforward attention, not only captures the deep features of time series data but also optimizes the model’s ability to identify key influencing factors, including land surface features, atmospheric conditions, and other static environmental variables. Unlike existing methods, the innovation of this model lies in its first-time combination of the residual learning encoder–decoder and feedforward attention mechanisms in the soil moisture prediction field. It delves into the complex patterns of time series through the encoder–decoder structure and accurately locates key influencing factors through the feedforward attention mechanism, significantly improving predictive performance. The choice to combine the feedforward attention mechanism and encoder–decoder with the LSTM model is to fully leverage their advantages in processing complex data sequences and enhancing the model’s focus on important features, aiming for more accurate soil moisture prediction. After comparison with current advanced models such as EDLSTM, FAMLSTM, and GANBiLSTM, our REDF-LSTM demonstrated the best performance. Compared to traditional LSTM models, it achieved an average improvement of 13.07% in R2, 20.98% in RMSE, 24.86% in BIAS, and 11.1% in KGE key performance indicators, fully proving its superior predictive capability and potential application value in precision agriculture and ecosystem management.">

To address these issues, we present a mutual information and graph embedding based anomaly detection algorithm in multivariate time series, called MGAD (mutual information and graph embedding based anomaly detection). The MGAD algorithm consists of four steps: (1) Embedding of sensor data, where heterogeneous sensor data become different vectors in the same vector space; (2) Constructing a relationship graph between sensors using their mutual information about each other; (3) Learning the relationship graph between sensors using a graph attention mechanism, to predict the sensor data at the next moment; (4) Compare the predicted values with the real sensor data to detect potential outliers. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose an unsupervised outlier detection called MGAD with a high interpretability and accuracy; (2) massive experiments on benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of the MGAD algorithm, compared with state-of-the-art baselines in terms of ROC, F1, and AP.">

        <tr id="Spatio-temporal time series analysis is a growing area of research that includes different types of tasks, such as forecasting, prediction, clustering, and visualization. In many domains, like epidemiology or economics, time series data are collected to describe the observed phenomenon in particular locations over a predefined time slot and predict future behavior. Regression methods provide a simple mechanism for evaluating empirical functions over scattered data points. In particular, kernel-based regressions are suitable for cases in which the relationship between the data points and the function is not linear. In this work, we propose a kernel-based iterative regression model, which fuses data from several spatial locations for improving the forecasting accuracy of a given time series. In more detail, the proposed method approximates and extends a function based on two or more spatial input modalities coded by a series of multiscale kernels, which are averaged as a convex combination. The proposed spatio-temporal regression resembles ideas that are present in deep learning architectures, such as passing information between scales. Nevertheless, the construction is easy to implement, and it is also suitable for modeling data sets of limited size. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed model for solar energy prediction, forecasting epidemiology infections, and future number of fire events. The method is compared with well-known regression techniques and highlights the benefits of the proposed model in terms of accuracy and flexibility. The reliable outcome of the proposed model and its nonparametric nature yield a robust tool to be integrated as a forecasting component in wide range of decision support systems that analyze time series data.

TS3IM evaluates multiple dimensions of similarity-trend, variability, and structural integrity-offering a more nuanced and comprehensive measure. This metric represents a significant leap forward, providing a robust tool for analyzing temporal data and offering more accurate and comprehensive sequence analysis and decision support in fields such as monitoring power consumption, analyzing traffic flow, and adversarial recognition. Our extensive experimental results also show that compared with traditional methods that rely heavily on computational correlation, TS3IM is 1.87 times more similar to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in evaluation results and improves by more than 50% in adversarial recognition.">

        <tr id="Time series data from real-world systems often display non-stationary behavior, indicating varying statistical characteristics over time. This inherent variability poses significant challenges in deciphering the underlying structural relationships within the data, particularly in correlation and causality analyses, model stability, etc. Recognizing distinct segments or regimes within multivariate time series data, characterized by relatively stable behavior and consistent statistical properties over extended periods, becomes crucial. In this study, we apply the regime identification (RegID) technique to multivariate time series, fundamentally designed to unveil locally stationary segments within data. The distinguishing features between regimes are identified using covariance matrices in a Riemannian space. We aim to highlight how regime identification contributes to improving the discovery of causal structures from multivariate non-stationary time series data. Our experiments, encompassing both synthetic and real-world datasets, highlight the effectiveness of regime-wise time series causal analysis. We validate our approach by first demonstrating improved causal structure discovery using synthetic data where the ground truth causal relationships are known. Subsequently, we apply this methodology to climate-ecosystem dataset, showcasing its applicability in real-world scenarios.">

        <tr id="Photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing renewable energy integration into the grid, necessitating accurate predictions to mitigate the inherent variability of solar energy generation. We propose a novel forecasting model that combines improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD) with the temporal convolutional network-gated recurrent unit (TCN-GRU) architecture, enriched with a multi-head attention mechanism. By focusing on four key environmental factors influencing PV output, the proposed IVMD-TCN-GRU framework targets a significant research gap in renewable energy forecasting methodologies. Initially, leveraging the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), we optimize the parameters of VMD, including the mode component K-value and penalty factor, based on the minimum envelope entropy principle. The optimized VMD then decomposes PV power, while the TCN-GRU model harnesses TCN’s proficiency in learning local temporal features and GRU’s capability in rapidly modeling sequence data, while leveraging multi-head attention to better utilize the global correlation information within sequence data. Through this design, the model adeptly captures the correlations within time series data, demonstrating superior performance in prediction tasks. Subsequently, the SSA is employed to optimize GRU parameters, and the decomposed PV power mode components and environmental feature attributes are inputted into the TCN-GRU neural network. This facilitates dynamic temporal modeling of multivariate feature sequences. Finally, the predicted values of each component are summed to realize PV power forecasting. Validation using real data from a PV station corroborates that the novel model demonstrates a substantial reduction in RMSE and MAE of up to 55.1% and 54.5%, respectively, particularly evident in instances of pronounced photovoltaic power fluctuations during inclement weather conditions. The proposed method exhibits marked improvements in accuracy compared to traditional PV power prediction methods, underscoring its significance in enhancing forecasting precision and ensuring the secure scheduling and stable operation of power systems.">

We consider a situation when we have time series data from multiple units that share similar patterns when aligned in terms of an internal time. The internal time is defined as an index according to evolving features of interest. When mapped back to the calendar time, these time series can span different time intervals that can include the future calendar time of the targeted unit, over which we can borrow the information from other units in forecasting the targeted unit. We first build a hierarchical state space model for the multiple time series data in terms of the internal time, where the shared components capture the similarities among different units while allowing for unit-specific deviations. A conditional state space model is then constructed to incorporate the information of existing units as the prior information in forecasting the targeted unit. By running the Kalman filtering based on the conditional state space model on the targeted unit, we incorporate both the information from the other units and the history of the targeted unit. The forecasts are then transformed from internal time back into calendar time for ease of interpretation. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance.

In order to achieve more accurate metro passenger flow forecasting, this paper proposes a metro passenger flow forecasting model based on time-series evolution interaction graph. First, by introducing two kinds of inter-station interaction graphs, namely connectivity graph and temporal correlation graph, to capture the potential interaction relationship among metro passenger flow stations. Then, by using the time-series evolving graph, the weights of the graph convolutional neural network are dynamically evolved in time series. Finally, taking Suzhou Metro as an example, the short-term passenger flow of the metro is forecasted. The experimental results show that the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of this model is 34.17, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is 16.35, the R-Squared is 0.94, the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) is 0.21.

        <tr id="For industrial processes, it is significant to carry out the dynamic modeling of data series for quality prediction. However, there are often different sampling rates between the input and output sequences. For the most traditional data series models, they have to carefully select the labeled sample sequence to build the dynamic prediction model, while the massive unlabeled input sequences between labeled samples are directly discarded. Moreover, the interactions of the variables and samples are usually not fully considered for quality prediction at each labeled step. To handle these problems, a hierarchical self-attention network (HSAN) is designed for adaptive dynamic modeling. In HSAN, a dynamic data augmentation is first designed for each labeled step to include the unlabeled input sequences. Then, a self-attention layer of variable level is proposed to learn the variable interactions and short-interval temporal dependencies. After that, a self-attention layer of sample level is further developed to model the long-interval temporal dependencies. Finally, a long short-term memory network (LSTM) network is constructed to model the new sequence that contains abundant interactions for quality prediction. The experiment on an industrial hydrocracking process shows the effectiveness of HSAN.">

Despite claims of superiority over traditional statistical and single machine learning-based models, achieving improved forecasting accuracy remains a formidable challenge. In FTS models, the lengths of intervals and fuzzy relationship groups are considered crucial factors influencing forecasting accuracy. Hence, this study introduces an FTS forecasting model based on the graph-based clustering technique. The clustering algorithm, utilized during the fuzzification stage, enables the derivation of unequal interval lengths. The proposed model is applied to forecast two numerical datasets: enrollment data from the University of Alabama and the datasets of Gas prices RON95 in Vietnam. Comparisons of forecasting results between the proposed model and others are conducted for enrollment forecasts at the University of Alabama.

        <tr id="The development of machine learning applications has increased significantly in recent years, motivated by the remarkable ability of learning-powered systems to discover and generalize intricate patterns hidden in massive datasets. Modern learning models, while powerful, often exhibit a level of complexity that renders them opaque black boxes, resulting in a notable lack of transparency that hinders our ability to decipher their decision-making processes. Opacity challenges the interpretability and practical application of machine learning, especially in critical domains where understanding the underlying reasons is essential for informed decision-making. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) rises to meet that challenge, unraveling the complexity of black boxes by providing elucidating explanations. Among the various XAI approaches, feature attribution/importance XAI stands out for its capacity to delineate the significance of input features in the prediction process. However, most existing attribution methods have limitations, such as instability, when divergent explanations may result from similar or even the same instance. In this work, we introduce T-Explainer, a novel local additive attribution explainer based on Taylor expansion endowed with desirable properties, such as local accuracy and consistency, while stable over multiple runs. We demonstrate T-Explainer's effectiveness through benchmark experiments with well-known attribution methods. In addition, T-Explainer is developed as a comprehensive XAI framework comprising quantitative metrics to assess and visualize attribution explanations.">

Our results on two different geographical locations and tasks indicate that the task-specific pretraining imposes a continuous ordering of the latent space embeddings according to the socioeconomic outcomes. This improves the model's interpretability as it enables the latent space of the model to associate urban concepts with continuous intervals of socioeconomic outcomes. Further, we illustrate how analyzing the model's conceptual sensitivity for the intervals of socioeconomic outcomes can shed light on new insights for urban studies.">

The main network is trained to learn inter–intra modality representations sequentially by regulating the use of each auxiliary network dynamically.

 Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTS-AD) is crucial for the effective management and maintenance of devices in complex systems such as server clusters, spacecrafts and financial systems etc. However, upgrade or cross-platform deployment of these devices will introduce the issue of cross-domain distribution shift, which leads to the prototypical problem of Domain Adaptation for MTS-AD. Compared with general domain adaptation problems, MTS-AD domain adaptation presents two peculiar challenges: 1) The dimensions of data from the source domain and the target domain are usually different, so alignment without losing any information is necessary. 2) The association between different variates plays a vital role in the MTS-AD task, which is overlooked by traditional domain adaptation approaches. Aiming at addressing the above issues, we propose a

 ph Deviation Network (abbreviated as

First, we characterize the intra-domain variate associations of the source domain by a graph deviation network (GDN), which can share parameters across domains without dimension alignment. Second, we propose a sliding similarity to measure the inter-domain variate associations and perform joint training by minimizing the optimal transport distance between source and target data for transferring variate associations across domains.
 VANDA
 achieves domain adaptation by transferring both variate associations and GDN parameters from the source domain to the target domain. We construct two pairs of MTS-AD datasets from existing MTS-AD data and combine three domain adaptation strategies with six MTS-AD backbones as the benchmark methods for experimental evaluation and comparison. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms the benchmark methods, and significantly improves the AD performance of the target domain by effectively utilizing the source domain knowledge.

        <tr id="In semi-supervised learning, methods that rely on confidence learning to generate pseudo-labels have been widely proposed. However, increasing research finds that when faced with noisy and biased data, the model's representation network is more reliable than the classification network. Additionally, label generation methods based on model predictions often show poor adaptability across different datasets, necessitating customization of the classification network. Therefore, we propose a Hierarchical Dynamic Labeling (HDL) algorithm that does not depend on model predictions and utilizes image embeddings to generate sample labels. We also introduce an adaptive method for selecting hyperparameters in HDL, enhancing its versatility. Moreover, HDL can be combined with general image encoders (e.g., CLIP) to serve as a fundamental data processing module. We extract embeddings from datasets with class-balanced and long-tailed distributions using pre-trained semi-supervised models. Subsequently, samples are re-labeled using HDL, and the re-labeled samples are used to further train the semi-supervised models. Experiments demonstrate improved model performance, validating the motivation that representation networks are more reliable than classifiers or predictors. Our approach has the potential to change the paradigm of pseudo-label generation in semi-supervised learning.">

        <tr id="The prediction of typhoon tracks in the Northwest Pacific is key to reducing human casualties and property damage. Traditional numerical forecasting models often require substantial computational resources, are high-cost, and have significant limitations in prediction speed. This research is dedicated to using deep learning methods to address the shortcomings of traditional methods. Our method (AFR-SimVP) is based on a large-kernel convolutional spatio-temporal prediction network combined with multi-feature fusion for forecasting typhoon tracks in the Northwest Pacific. In order to more effectively suppress the effect of noise in the dataset to enhance the generalization ability of the model, we use a multi-branch structure, incorporate an atmospheric reconstruction subtask, and propose a second-order smoothing loss to further improve the prediction ability of the model. More importantly, we innovatively propose a multi-time-step typhoon prediction network (HTAFR-SimVP) that does not use the traditional recurrent neural network family of models at all. Instead, through fine-to-coarse hierarchical temporal feature extraction and dynamic self-distillation, multi-time-step prediction is achieved using only a single regression network. In addition, combined with atmospheric field reconstruction, the network achieves integrated prediction for multiple tasks, which greatly enhances the model’s range of applications. Experiments show that our proposed network achieves optimal performance in the 24 h typhoon track prediction task. Our regression network outperforms previous recurrent network-based typhoon prediction models in the multi-time-step prediction task and also performs well in multiple integration tasks.">

Firstly, a bidirectional spatiotemporal feature extraction module was constructed by combining Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which can simultaneously extract spatial and temporal features. Then, by combining multi-scale convolution with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), multi-scale contextual information was captured.

        <tr id="Background: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to interpret and generate human-like text has been accompanied with speculation about their application in medicine and clinical research. There is limited data available to inform evidence-based decisions on the appropriateness for specific use cases. Methods: We evaluated and compared four general-purpose LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Flan-T5-XXL, and Zephyr-7B-Beta) and a healthcare-specific LLM (MedLLaMA-13B) on a set of 13 datasets - referred to as the Biomedical Language Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark (BLURB) - covering six commonly needed medical natural language processing tasks: named entity recognition (NER); relation extraction; population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO); sentence similarity; document classification; and question-answering. All models were evaluated without modification. Model performance was assessed according to a range of prompting strategies (formalised as a systematic, reusable prompting framework) and relied on the standard, task-specific evaluation metrics defined by BLURB. Results: Across all tasks, GPT-4 outperformed other LLMs, followed by Flan-T5-XXL and GPT-3.5- turbo, then Zephyr-7b-Beta and MedLLaMA-13B. The most performant prompts for GPT-4 and Flan-T5-XXL both outperformed the previously-reported best results for the PubMedQA task. The domain-specific MedLLaMA-13B achieved lower scores for most tasks except for question-answering tasks. We observed a substantial impact of strategically editing the prompt describing the task and a consistent improvement in performance when including examples semantically similar to the input text in the prompt. Conclusion: These results provide evidence of the potential LLMs may have for medical application and highlight the importance of robust evaluation before adopting LLMs for any specific use cases. Continuing to explore how these emerging technologies can be adapted for the healthcare setting, paired with human expertise, and enhanced through quality control measures will be important research to allow responsible innovation with LLMs in the medical area.">

        <tr id="Data assimilation (DA), as an indispensable component within contemporary Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems, plays a crucial role in generating the analysis that significantly impacts forecast performance. Nevertheless, the development of an efficient DA system poses significant challenges, particularly in establishing intricate relationships between the background data and the vast amount of multi-source observation data within limited time windows in operational settings. To address these challenges, researchers design complex pre-processing methods for each observation type, leveraging approximate modeling and the power of super-computing clusters to expedite solutions. The emergence of deep learning (DL) models has been a game-changer, offering unified multi-modal modeling, enhanced nonlinear representation capabilities, and superior parallelization. These advantages have spurred efforts to integrate DL models into various domains of weather modeling. Remarkably, DL models have shown promise in matching, even surpassing, the forecast accuracy of leading operational NWP models worldwide. This success motivates the exploration of DL-based DA frameworks tailored for weather forecasting models. In this study, we introduces FuxiDA, a generalized DL-based DA framework for assimilating satellite observations. By assimilating data from Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) aboard Fengyun-4B, FuXi-DA consistently mitigates analysis errors and significantly improves forecast performance. Furthermore, through a series of single-observation experiments, Fuxi-DA has been validated against established atmospheric physics, demonstrating its consistency and reliability.">

        <tr id="As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in dynamic environments, it becomes paramount to assess and quantify uncertainties associated with distribution shifts. A distribution shift occurs when the underlying data-generating process changes, leading to a deviation in the model's performance. The prediction interval, which captures the range of likely outcomes for a given prediction, serves as a crucial tool for characterizing uncertainties induced by their underlying distribution. In this paper, we propose methodologies for aggregating prediction intervals to obtain one with minimal width and adequate coverage on the target domain under unsupervised domain shift, under which we have labeled samples from a related source domain and unlabeled covariates from the target domain. Our analysis encompasses scenarios where the source and the target domain are related via i) a bounded density ratio, and ii) a measure-preserving transformation. Our proposed methodologies are computationally efficient and easy to implement. Beyond illustrating the performance of our method through a real-world dataset, we also delve into the theoretical details. This includes establishing rigorous theoretical guarantees, coupled with finite sample bounds, regarding the coverage and width of our prediction intervals. Our approach excels in practical applications and is underpinned by a solid theoretical framework, ensuring its reliability and effectiveness across diverse contexts.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained much more attention in the representation learning for the graph-structured data. However, the labels are always limited in the graph, which easily leads to the overfitting problem and causes the poor performance. To solve this problem, we propose a new framework called IGCN, short for Informative Graph Convolutional Network, where the objective of IGCN is designed to obtain the informative embeddings via discarding the task-irrelevant information of the graph data based on the mutual information. As the mutual information for irregular data is intractable to compute, our framework is optimized via a surrogate objective, where two terms are derived to approximate the original objective. For the former term, it demonstrates that the mutual information between the learned embeddings and the ground truth should be high, where we utilize the semi-supervised classification loss and the prototype based supervised contrastive learning loss for optimizing it. For the latter term, it requires that the mutual information between the learned node embeddings and the initial embeddings should be high and we propose to minimize the reconstruction loss between them to achieve the goal of maximizing the latter term from the feature level and the layer level, which contains the graph encoder-decoder module and a novel architecture GCN Info. Moreover, we provably show that the designed GCN Info can better alleviate the information loss and preserve as much useful information of the initial embeddings as possible. Experimental results show that the IGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on 7 popular datasets.">

It is useful for modeling and predicting non-stationary time series and is widely applied in natural and social sciences. Existing segmentation methods primarily focus on only one type of parameter changes such as mean and variance, and they typically depend on laborious tuning or smoothing parameters, which can be challenging to choose in practice. The self-normalization based change-point estimation framework SNCP by Zhao et al. (2022), however, offers users more flexibility and convenience as it allows for change-point estimation of different types of parameters (e.g. mean, variance, quantile and autocovariance) in a unified fashion, and requires effortless tuning. In this paper, the R package SNSeg is introduced to implement SNCP for segmentation of univariate and multivariate time series. An extension of SNCP, named SNHD, is also designed and implemented for change-point estimation in the mean vector of high-dimensional time series. The estimated changepoints as well as segmented time series are available with graphical tools. Detailed examples of SNSeg are given in simulations of multivariate autoregressive processes with change-points.">

Prior to the breakthrough of LLMs, Transformers had already proven successful in the medical domain, effectively employed for various natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Following this trend, LLMs have also been trained and utilized in the medical domain, raising concerns regarding factual accuracy, adherence to safety protocols, and inherent limitations.

In this paper, we jointly tackle these two-fold practical challenges by proposing SADDLe, a set of sharpness-aware decentralized deep learning algorithms. SADDLe leverages Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to seek a flatter loss landscape during training, resulting in better model generalization as well as enhanced robustness to communication compression. We present two versions of our approach and conduct extensive experiments to show that SADDLe leads to 1-20% improvement in test accuracy compared to other existing techniques. Additionally, our proposed approach is robust to communication compression, with an average drop of only 1% in the presence of up to 4x compression.">

Recently, a non-asymptotic error bound has been developed to measure the performance of the fully connected DNN estimator with ReLU activation functions for estimating regression models. The paper at hand gives a small improvement on the current error bound based on the latest results on the approximation ability of DNN. More importantly, however, a non-random subsampling technique--scalable subsampling--is applied to construct a `subagged' DNN estimator. Under regularity conditions, it is shown that the subagged DNN estimator is computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy for either estimation or prediction tasks. Beyond point estimation/prediction, we propose different approaches to build confidence and prediction intervals based on the subagged DNN estimator. In addition to being asymptotically valid, the proposed confidence/prediction intervals appear to work well in finite samples. All in all, the scalable subsampling DNN estimator offers the complete package in terms of statistical inference, i.e., (a) computational efficiency; (b) point estimation/prediction accuracy; and (c) allowing for the construction of practically useful confidence and prediction intervals.">

        <tr id="Quantifying relationships between components of a complex system is critical to understanding the rich network of interactions that characterize the behavior of the system. Traditional methods for detecting pairwise dependence of time series, such as Pearson correlation, Granger causality, and mutual information, are computed directly in the space of measured time-series values. But for systems in which interactions are mediated by statistical properties of the time series (`time-series features') over longer timescales, this approach can fail to capture the underlying dependence from limited and noisy time-series data, and can be challenging to interpret. Addressing these issues, here we introduce an information-theoretic method for detecting dependence between time series mediated by time-series features that provides interpretable insights into the nature of the interactions. Our method extracts a candidate set of time-series features from sliding windows of the source time series and assesses their role in mediating a relationship to values of the target process. Across simulations of three different generative processes, we demonstrate that our feature-based approach can outperform a traditional inference approach based on raw time-series values, especially in challenging scenarios characterized by short time-series lengths, high noise levels, and long interaction timescales. Our work introduces a new tool for inferring and interpreting feature-mediated interactions from time-series data, contributing to the broader landscape of quantitative analysis in complex systems research, with potential applications in various domains including but not limited to neuroscience, finance, climate science, and engineering.">

This paper presents a novel methodology that addresses this challenge. We introduce a Bayesian optimization framework, integrated with a bootstrap-based variance estimator tailored for short signals, to simultaneously and optimally select the values of $m$ and $r$ for reliable SampEn estimation. Through validation on synthetic signal experiments, our approach outperformed existing benchmarks. It achieved a 60 to 90% reduction in relative error for estimating SampEn variance and a 22 to 45% decrease in relative mean squared error for SampEn estimation itself ($p \leq 0.043$). Applying our method to publicly available short-signal benchmarks yielded promising results. Unlike existing competitors, our approach was the only one to successfully identify known entropy differences across all signal sets ($p \leq 0.042$). Additionally, we introduce"EristroPy,"an open-source Python package that implements our proposed optimization framework for SampEn hyperparameter selection.

To this end, we analyze social media data from two disaster events in two different countries to identify reported impacts to CIFs as well as their impact severity and operational status. We employ state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to perform computational tasks including retrieval, classification, and inference, all in a zero-shot setting. Through extensive experimentation, we report the results of these tasks using standard evaluation metrics and reveal insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs. We note that although LLMs perform well in classification tasks, they encounter challenges with inference tasks, especially when the context/prompt is complex and lengthy. Additionally, we outline various potential directions for future exploration that can be beneficial during the initial adoption phase of LLMs for disaster response tasks.">

 Graph collaborative filtering (GCF) has achieved exciting recommendation performance with its ability to aggregate high-order graph structure information. Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has been incorporated into GCF to alleviate data sparsity and noise issues. However, most of the existing methods employ random or manual augmentation to produce contrastive views that may destroy the original topology and amplify the noisy effects. We argue that such augmentation is insufficient to produce the optimal contrastive view, leading to suboptimal recommendation results. In this paper, we proposed a

Specifically, we first use the graph convolution network (GCN) as a backbone encoder to incorporate multi-hop neighbors into graph-level original node representations by leveraging the high-order connectivity in user-item interaction graphs. At the same time, we treat the multi-head graph attention network (GAT) as an augmentation view generator to adaptively generate high-quality node-level augmented views. Finally, joint learning endows the end-to-end training fashion. In this case, the mutual supervision and collaborative cooperation of GCN and GAT achieves learnable model augmentation. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that LMACL provides a significant improvement over the strongest baseline in terms of

        <tr id="Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspective by considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the $\textit{Fisher-Rao metric}$. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-Flow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks.">

 Graph augmentation is the key component to reveal instance-discriminative features of a graph as its rationale – an interpretation for it – in graph contrastive learning (GCL). And existing rationale-aware augmentation mechanisms in GCL frameworks roughly fall into two categories and suffer from inherent limitations: (1) non-heuristic methods with the guidance of domain knowledge to preserve salient features, which require expensive expertise and lack generality, or (2) heuristic augmentations with a co-trained auxiliary model to identify crucial substructures, which face not only the dilemma between system complexity and transformation diversity, but also the instability stemming from the co-training of two separated submodels. Inspired by recent studies on transformers, we propose

        <tr id="Machine Learning algorithms are notorious for providing point predictions but not prediction intervals. There are many applications where one requires confidence in predictions and prediction intervals. Stringing together, these intervals give rise to joint prediction regions with the desired significance level. It is an easy task to compute Joint Prediction regions (JPR) when the data is IID. However, the task becomes overly difficult when JPR is needed for time series because of the dependence between the observations. This project aims to implement Wolf and Wunderli's method for constructing JPRs and compare it with other methods (e.g. NP heuristic, Joint Marginals). The method under study is based on bootstrapping and is applied to different datasets (Min Temp, Sunspots), using different predictors (e.g. ARIMA and LSTM). One challenge of applying the method under study is to derive prediction standard errors for models, it cannot be obtained analytically. A novel method to estimate prediction standard error for different predictors is also devised. Finally, the method is applied to a synthetic dataset to find empirical averages and empirical widths and the results from the Wolf and Wunderli paper are consolidated. The experimental results show a narrowing of width with strong predictors like neural nets, widening of width with increasing forecast horizon H and decreasing significance level alpha, controlling the width with parameter k in K-FWE, and loss of information using Joint Marginals.">

Recently, many organizations training state-of-the-art Generative AI models have reported cases of instability during training, often taking the form of loss spikes. Numeric deviation has emerged as a potential cause of this training instability, although quantifying this is especially challenging given the costly nature of training runs. In this work, we develop a principled approach to understanding the effects of numeric deviation, and construct proxies to put observations into context when downstream effects are difficult to quantify. As a case study, we apply this framework to analyze the widely-adopted Flash Attention optimization. We find that Flash Attention sees roughly an order of magnitude more numeric deviation as compared to Baseline Attention at BF16 when measured during an isolated forward pass. We then use a data-driven analysis based on the Wasserstein Distance to provide upper bounds on how this numeric deviation impacts model weights during training, finding that the numerical deviation present in Flash Attention is 2-5 times less significant than low-precision training.">

However, most progress has focused on proving identifiability results in different settings, and we are not aware of any successful real-world application. At the same time, the field of dynamical systems benefited from deep learning and scaled to countless applications but does not allow parameter identification. In this paper, we draw a clear connection between the two and their key assumptions, allowing us to apply identifiable methods developed in causal representation learning to dynamical systems. At the same time, we can leverage scalable differentiable solvers developed for differential equations to build models that are both identifiable and practical. Overall, we learn explicitly controllable models that isolate the trajectory-specific parameters for further downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution classification or treatment effect estimation. We experiment with a wind simulator with partially known factors of variation. We also apply the resulting model to real-world climate data and successfully answer downstream causal questions in line with existing literature on climate change.">

By integrating state space theory, the model aims to enhance the capability to capture dynamic changes in complex data, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of prediction tasks. Extensive experimental validations were conducted on three representative tasks, including legal case judgment, legal case translation, and financial data analysis to assess the performance and application potential of the model. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements of the proposed model over traditional Transformer models and other advanced variants such as Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) and Finsformer across all evaluated tasks. Specifically, in the task of legal case judgment, the proposed model exhibited a precision of 0.93, a recall of 0.90, and an accuracy of 0.91, significantly surpassing the traditional Transformer model (with precision of 0.78, recall of 0.73, accuracy of 0.76) and performances of other comparative models. In the task of legal case translation, the precision of the proposed model reached 0.95, with a recall of 0.91 and an accuracy of 0.93, also outperforming other models. Likewise, in the task of financial data analysis, the proposed model also demonstrated excellent performance, with a precision of 0.94, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.92. The state space-based Transformer model proposed not only theoretically expands the research boundaries of deep learning models in complex system prediction but also validates its efficiency and broad application prospects through experiments. These achievements provide new insights and directions for future research and development of deep learning models, especially in tasks requiring the understanding and prediction of complex system dynamics.">

As the data collection process becomes effortless, the next change encountered is to identify the best method to forecast time series data with high accuracies. In this regard, hybrid approaches have gained much attention where the strengths of two approaches can be combined to lessen the weaknesses of each individual approach. When exploring the features of time series data, some depict repetitive patterns and also data can be observed at several levels. The repeating curves can be considered as the higher level, whereas each individual observation can be considered as the lower level. Thus, in order to handle the data in a more effective way, the series can be handled at two levels by giving prominence to the features of each level separately. This paper proposes a novel algorithm named two level neuro-functional forecaster, which is capable of handling data at two levels, hybridizing a statistical approach with an artificial intelligence approach, to gain high accuracy levels. In addition, as this approach handles data at two levels, data sparsity at a particular level can be accommodated at the other level. To apply this algorithm to a real world dataset, electricity demand data in Sri Lanka was considered where the series consisted of daily load curves with repetitive pattern across the days. The proposed hybrid algorithm, outperforms the two approaches when individually used, with a MAPE of 3.324% for a year.">

In climate science, analogs in historical and climate projection data are used for attribution and impact studies. However, most of the time, those large weather and climate datasets are nearline. They must be downloaded, which takes a lot of bandwidth and disk space, before the computationally expensive search can be executed. We propose a dimension reduction technique based on autoencoder (AE) neural networks to compress those datasets and perform the search in an interpretable, compressed latent space. A distance-regularized Siamese twin autoencoder (DIRESA) architecture is designed to preserve distance in latent space while capturing the nonlinearities in the datasets. Using conceptual climate models of different complexities, we show that the latent components thus obtained provide physical insight into the dominant modes of variability in the system. Compressing datasets with DIRESA reduces the online storage and keeps the latent components uncorrelated, while the distance (ordering) preservation and reconstruction fidelity robustly outperform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other dimension reduction techniques such as UMAP or variational autoencoders.">

        <tr id="The response time of a biosensor is a crucial metric in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnostics where an earlier diagnosis can markedly improve patient outcomes. However, the speed at which a biosensor reaches a final equilibrium state can be limited by poor mass transport and long molecular diffusion times that increase the time it takes target molecules to reach the active sensing region of a biosensor. While optimization of system and sensor design can promote molecules reaching the sensing element faster, a simpler and complementary approach for response time reduction that is widely applicable across all sensor platforms is to use time-series forecasting to predict the ultimate steady-state sensor response. In this work, we show that ensembles of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks can accurately predict equilibrium biosensor response from a small quantity of initial time-dependent biosensor measurements, allowing for significant reduction in response time by a mean and median factor of improvement of 18.6 and 5.1, respectively. The ensemble of models also provides simultaneous estimation of uncertainty, which is vital to provide confidence in the predictions and subsequent safety-related decisions that are made. This approach is demonstrated on real-time experimental data collected by exposing porous silicon biosensors to buffered protein solutions using a multi-channel fluidic cell that enables the automated measurement of 100 porous silicon biosensors in parallel. The dramatic improvement in sensor response time achieved using LSTM network ensembles and associated uncertainty quantification opens the door to trustworthy and faster responding biosensors, enabling more rapid medical diagnostics for improved patient outcomes and healthcare access, as well as quicker identification of toxins in food and the environment.">

        <tr id="Graph Attention (GA) which aims to learn the attention coefficients for graph edges has achieved impressive performance in GNNs on many graph learning tasks. However, existing GAs are usually learned based on edges' (or connected nodes') features which fail to fully capture the rich structural information of edges. Some recent research attempts to incorporate the structural information into GA learning but how to fully exploit them in GA learning is still a challenging problem. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose to leverage a new Replicator Dynamics model for graph attention learning, termed Graph Replicator Attention (GRA). The core of GRA is our derivation of replicator dynamics based sparse attention diffusion which can explicitly learn context-aware and sparse preserved graph attentions via a simple self-supervised way. Moreover, GRA can be theoretically explained from an energy minimization model. This provides a more theoretical justification for the proposed GRA method. Experiments on several graph learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GRA method on ten benchmark datasets.">

        <tr id="Temporal network embedding (TNE) has promoted the research of knowledge discovery and reasoning on networks. It aims to embed vertices of temporal networks into a low-dimensional vector space while preserving network structures and temporal properties. However, most existing methods have limitations in capturing dynamics over long distances, which makes it difficult to explore multihop topological associations among vertices. To tackle this challenge, we propose LongTNE, which learns the long-range dynamics of vertices to endow TNE with the ability to capture high-order proximity (HP) of networks. In LongTNE, we employ graph self-supervised learning (Graph SSL) to optimize the establishment probability of deep links in each network snapshot. We also present an accumulated forward update (AFU) module to fathom global temporal evolution among multiple network snapshots. The empirical results on six temporal networks demonstrate that, in addition to achieving state-of-the-art performance on network mining tasks, LongTNE can be handily extended to existing TNE methods.">

        <tr id="Knowledge tracing plays a crucial role in effectively representing learners’ understanding and predicting their future learning progress. However, existing deep knowledge tracing methods, reliant on the forgetting model and Rasch model, often fail to account for the varying rates at which learners forget different knowledge concepts and the variations in question embedding covering the same concept. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an enhanced deep knowledge tracing model that combines the transformer network model with two innovative components. The first component is a multiband attention mechanism, which comprehensively summarizes a learner’s past response history across various temporal scales. By computing attention weights using different decay rates, this mechanism adaptively captures both long-term and short-term interactions for different knowledge concepts. The second component utilizes a quantized question embedding module to effectively capture variations among questions addressing the same knowledge concept. This module represents these differences in a rich embedding space, avoiding overparameterization or overfitting issues. The proposed model is evaluated on popular benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing knowledge tracing methods in accuracy. This enhancement holds potential for improving personalized learning systems by providing more precise insights into learners’ progress.">

        <tr id="Modeling non-stationary data is a challenging problem in the field of continual learning, and data distribution shifts may result in negative consequences on the performance of a machine learning model. Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques. In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes. We explore the problem in a latent space generated by a bio-inspired self-organizing clustering and statistical aspects of the latent space. In particular, we investigate the projections made by two topology-preserving maps: the Self-Organizing Map and the Scale Invariant Map. Our method can be applied in both a supervised and an unsupervised context. We construct the assessment of changes in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making the proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA. Our comparison involves conducting experiments using sequences of images (based on MNIST and injected shifts with adversarial samples), chemical sensor measurements, and the environmental variable related to ozone levels. The empirical study reveals the potential of the proposed approach.">

        <tr id="Tensor clustering has become an important topic, specifically in spatio-temporal modeling, due to its ability to cluster spatial modes (e.g., stations or road segments) and temporal modes (e.g., time of the day or day of the week). Our motivating example is from subway passenger flow modeling, where similarities between stations are commonly found. However, the challenges lie in the innate high-dimensionality of tensors and also the potential existence of anomalies. This is because the three tasks, i.e., dimension reduction, clustering, and anomaly decomposition, are inter-correlated to each other, and treating them in a separate manner will render a suboptimal performance. Thus, in this work, we design a tensor-based subspace clustering and anomaly decomposition technique for simultaneously outlier-robust dimension reduction and clustering for high-dimensional tensors. To achieve this, a novel low-rank robust subspace clustering decomposition model is proposed by combining Tucker decomposition, sparse anomaly decomposition, and subspace clustering. An effective algorithm based on Block Coordinate Descent is proposed to update the parameters. Prudent experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework via the simulation study, with a gain of +25% clustering accuracy than benchmark methods in a hard case. The interrelations of the three tasks are also analyzed via ablation studies, validating the interrelation assumption. Moreover, a case study in the station clustering based on real passenger flow data is conducted, with quite valuable insights discovered.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modelling techniques provide a method for deriving models of dynamical systems directly from complicated data streams. However, tracking and forecasting such data streams poses a significant challenge to most methods, as they assume the underlying process and model does not change over time. In this paper, we apply one such data-driven method, the Koopman autoencoder (KAE), to high-dimensional oscillatory data to generate a low-dimensional latent space and model, where the system's dynamics appear linear. This allows one to accurately track and forecast systems where the underlying model may change over time. States and the model in the reduced order latent space can then be efficiently updated as new data becomes available, using data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), in a technique we call the KAE EnKF. We demonstrate that this approach is able to effectively track and forecast time-varying, nonlinear dynamical systems in synthetic examples. We then apply the KAE EnKF to a video of a physical pendulum, and achieve a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. By generating effective latent space reconstructions, we find that we are able to construct accurate short-term forecasts and efficient adaptations to externally forced changes to the pendulum's frequency.">

        <tr id="In the realm of automated industry and smart production, the deployment of fault warning systems is crucial for ensuring equipment reliability and enhancing operational efficiency. Although there are a multitude of existing methodologies for fault warning, the proficiency of these systems in processing and analysing data is increasingly challenged by the progression of industrial apparatus and the escalating magnitude and intricacy of the data involved. To address these challenges, this research outlines an innovative fault warning methodology that combines a bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network with an enhanced hunter–prey optimisation (EHPO) algorithm. The Bi-LSTM network is strategically utilised to outline complex temporal patterns in machinery operational data, while the EHPO algorithm is employed to meticulously fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Bi-LSTM, aiming to enhance the accuracy and generalisability of fault warning. The EHPO algorithm, building upon the foundational hunter–prey optimisation (HPO) framework, introduces an advanced population initialisation process, integrates a range of strategic exploration methodologies, and strengthens its search paradigms through the incorporation of the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. This comprehensive enhancement aims to boost the global search efficiency and accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. Empirical analyses, conducted using datasets from real-world industrial scenarios, have validated the improved warning performance of this proposed methodology against some benchmark techniques, as evidenced by superior metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), albeit with a slight increase in computational resource requirements. This study not only proposes a novel paradigm for fault warning within complex industrial frameworks but also contributes to the discourse on hyperparameter optimisation within the field of machine learning algorithms.">

Current prediction methods mainly include reservoir engineering methods, numerical simulation methods, and deep learning methods, and the required prerequisite is a large amount of historical data. However, when the data used to train the model are insufficient, the prediction effect will be reduced dramatically. In this paper, a time series-related meta-learning (TsrML) method is proposed that can be applied to the prediction of petroleum time series containing small samples and can address the limitations of traditional deep learning methods for the few-shot problem, thereby supporting the development of production measures. The approach involves an architecture divided into meta-learner and base-learner, which learns initialization parameters from 89 time series datasets. It can be quickly adapted to achieve excellent and accurate predictions with small samples in the oil field. Three case studies were performed using time series from two actual oil fields. For objective evaluation, the proposed method is compared with several traditional methods. Compared to traditional deep learning methods, RMSE is decreased by 0.1766 on average, and MAPE is decreased by 4.8013 on average. The empirical results show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional deep learning methods.">

Moreover, the expertise needed to integrate this prior knowledge into probabilistic modeling typically limits the application of these models to specialists. Our goal is to build a regression model that can process numerical data and make probabilistic predictions at arbitrary locations, guided by natural language text which describes a user's prior knowledge. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a useful starting point for designing such a tool since they 1) provide an interface where users can incorporate expert insights in natural language and 2) provide an opportunity for leveraging latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs that users may not have themselves. We start by exploring strategies for eliciting explicit, coherent numerical predictive distributions from LLMs. We examine these joint predictive distributions, which we call LLM Processes, over arbitrarily-many quantities in settings such as forecasting, multi-dimensional regression, black-box optimization, and image modeling. We investigate the practical details of prompting to elicit coherent predictive distributions, and demonstrate their effectiveness at regression. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to usefully incorporate text into numerical predictions, improving predictive performance and giving quantitative structure that reflects qualitative descriptions. This lets us begin to explore the rich, grounded hypothesis space that LLMs implicitly encode.">

By considering the state of the knowledge graph as environment states defining actions as operations for integrating contexts and using a reward function to gauge the improvement in knowledge graph quality post-integration, this method aims to automatically develop strategies for optimal context integration. Our DQN model utilizes networks as function approximators, continually updating Q values to estimate the action value function, thus enabling effective integration of intricate and dynamic context information.
