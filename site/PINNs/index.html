In this two part treatise, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct classes of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information. In this first part, we demonstrate how these networks can be used to infer solutions to partial differential equations, and obtain physics-informed surrogate models that are fully differentiable with respect to all input coordinates and free parameters.">

In this second part of our two-part treatise, we focus on the problem of data-driven discovery of partial differential equations.

The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using a wide range of benchmark problems in mathematical physics, including conservation laws, incompressible fluid flow, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.">

        <tr id="The process of transforming observed data into predictive mathematical models of the physical world has always been paramount in science and engineering. Although data is currently being collected at an ever-increasing pace, devising meaningful models out of such observations in an automated fashion still remains an open problem. In this work, we put forth a machine learning approach for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Specifically, we blend classical tools from numerical analysis, namely the multi-step time-stepping schemes, with powerful nonlinear function approximators, namely deep neural networks, to distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems involving the identification of complex, nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and we demonstrate how this allows us to accurately learn the dynamics, forecast future states, and identify basins of attraction. In particular, we study the Lorenz system, the fluid flow behind a cylinder, the Hopf bifurcation, and the Glycoltic oscillator model as an example of complicated nonlinear dynamics typical of biological systems.">

        <tr id="Mathematical models of biological reactions at the system-level lead to a set of ordinary differential equations with many unknown parameters that need to be inferred using relatively few experimental measurements. Having a reliable and robust algorithm for parameter inference and prediction of the hidden dynamics has been one of the core subjects in systems biology, and is the focus of this study. We have developed a new systems-biology-informed deep learning algorithm that incorporates the system of ordinary differential equations into the neural networks. Enforcing these equations effectively adds constraints to the optimization procedure that manifests itself as an imposed structure on the observational data. Using few scattered and noisy measurements, we are able to infer the dynamics of unobserved species, external forcing, and the unknown model parameters. We have successfully tested the algorithm for three different benchmark problems. Author summary The dynamics of systems biological processes are usually modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which introduce various unknown parameters that need to be estimated efficiently from noisy measurements of concentration for a few species only. In this work, we present a new “systems-informed neural network” to infer the dynamics of experimentally unobserved species as well as the unknown parameters in the system of equations. By incorporating the system of ODEs into the neural networks, we effectively add constraints to the optimization algorithm, which makes the method robust to noisy and sparse measurements.">

        <tr id="The nonlinear sine-Gordon equation is a prevalent feature in numerous scientific and engineering problems. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), to investigate and explore the solution of the generalized non-linear sine-Gordon equation, encompassing Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. To incorporate physical information for the sine-Gordon equation, a multiobjective loss function has been defined consisting of the residual of governing partial differential equation (PDE), initial conditions, and various boundary conditions. Using multiple densely connected independent artificial neural networks (ANNs), called feedforward deep neural networks designed to handle partial differential equations, PINNs have been trained through automatic differentiation to minimize a loss function that incorporates the given PDE that governs the physical laws of phenomena. To illustrate the effectiveness, validity, and practical implications of our proposed approach, two computational examples from the nonlinear sine-Gordon are presented. We have developed a PINN algorithm and implemented it using Python software. Various experiments were conducted to determine an optimal neural architecture. The network training was employed by using the current state-of-the-art optimization methods in machine learning known as Adam and L-BFGS-B minimization techniques. Additionally, the solutions from the proposed method are compared with the established analytical solutions found in the literature. The findings show that the proposed method is a computational machine learning approach that is accurate and efficient for solving nonlinear sine-Gordon equations with a variety of boundary conditions as well as any complex nonlinear physical problems across multiple disciplines.">

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate physical principles-typically mathematical models expressed as differential equations-into the machine learning (ML) processes to guarantee the physical validity of ML model solutions. This approach has gained traction in science and engineering for modeling a wide range of physical phenomena. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of PINNs in solving nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), is found challenging due to discontinuities inherent in such PDE solutions. While previous research has focused on advancing training algorithms, our study highlights that encoding precise physical laws into PINN framework suffices to address the challenge. By coupling well-constructed governing equations into the most basic, simply structured PINNs, this research tackles both data-independent solution and data-driven discovery of the Buckley-Leverett equation, a typical hyperbolic PDE central to modeling multi-phase fluid flow in porous media. Our results reveal that vanilla PINNs are adequate to solve the Buckley-Leverett equation with superior precision and even handling more complex scenarios including variations in fluid mobility ratios, the addition of a gravity term to the original governing equation, and the presence of multiple discontinuities in the solution. This capability of PINNs enables accurate, efficient modeling and prediction of practical engineering problems, such as water flooding, polymer flooding, inclined flooding, and carbon dioxide injection into saline aquifers. Furthermore, the forward PINN framework with slight modifications can be adapted for inverse problems, allowing the estimation of PDE parameters in the Buckley-Leverett equation from observed data. Sensitivity analysis demonstrate that PINNs remain effective under conditions of slight data scarcity and up to a 5% data impurity.">

At the upper level, we minimize the data loss with respect to the PDE parameters. At the lower level, we train a neural network to locally approximate the PDE solution operator in the neighborhood of a given set of PDE parameters, which enables an accurate approximation of the descent direction for the upper level optimization problem. The lower level loss function includes the L2 norms of both the residual and its derivative with respect to the PDE parameters. We apply gradient descent simultaneously on both the upper and lower level optimization problems, leading to an effective and fast algorithm. The method, which we refer to as BiLO (Bilevel Local Operator learning), is also able to efficiently infer unknown functions in the PDEs through the introduction of an auxiliary variable. We demonstrate that our method enforces strong PDE constraints, is robust to sparse and noisy data, and eliminates the need to balance the residual and the data loss, which is inherent to soft PDE constraints.">

        <tr id="Using neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) is gaining popularity as an alternative approach in the scientific computing community. Neural networks can integrate different types of information into the loss function. These include observation data, governing equations, and variational forms, etc. These loss functions can be broadly categorized into two types: observation data loss directly constrains and measures the model output, while other loss functions indirectly model the performance of the network, which can be classified as model loss. However, this alternative approach lacks a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms, including theoretical foundations and rigorous characterization of various phenomena. This work focuses on investigating how different loss functions impact the training of neural networks for solving PDEs. We discover a stable loss-jump phenomenon: when switching the loss function from the data loss to the model loss, which includes different orders of derivative information, the neural network solution significantly deviates from the exact solution immediately. Further experiments reveal that this phenomenon arises from the different frequency preferences of neural networks under different loss functions. We theoretically analyze the frequency preference of neural networks under model loss. This loss-jump phenomenon provides a valuable perspective for examining the underlying mechanisms of neural networks in solving PDEs.">

        <tr id="Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on fine spatio-temporal scales for high-fidelity solutions is critical for numerous scientific breakthroughs. Yet, this process can be prohibitively expensive, owing to the inherent complexities of the problems, including nonlinearity and multiscale phenomena. To speed up large-scale computations, a process known as downscaling is employed, which generates high-fidelity approximate solutions from their low-fidelity counterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel Physics-Guided Diffusion Model (PGDM) for downscaling. Our model, initially trained on a dataset comprising low-and-high-fidelity paired solutions across coarse and fine scales, generates new high-fidelity approximations from any new low-fidelity inputs. These outputs are subsequently refined through fine-tuning, aimed at minimizing the physical discrepancies as defined by the discretized PDEs at the finer scale. We evaluate and benchmark our model's performance against other downscaling baselines in three categories of nonlinear PDEs. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model not only outperforms the baselines but also achieves a computational acceleration exceeding tenfold, while maintaining the same level of accuracy as the conventional fine-scale solvers.">

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) serve as a flexible alternative for tackling forward and inverse problems in differential equations, displaying impressive advancements in diverse areas of applied mathematics. Despite integrating both data and underlying physics to enrich the neural network's understanding, concerns regarding the effectiveness and practicality of PINNs persist. Over the past few years, extensive efforts in the current literature have been made to enhance this evolving method, by drawing inspiration from both machine learning algorithms and numerical methods. Despite notable progressions in PINNs algorithms, the important and fundamental field of data preprocessing remain unexplored, limiting the applications of PINNs especially in solving inverse problems. Therefore in this paper, a concise yet potent data preprocessing method focusing on data normalization was proposed. By applying a linear transformation to both the data and corresponding equations concurrently, the normalized PINNs approach was evaluated on the task of reconstructing flow fields in three turbulent cases. The results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, illustrate that by adhering to the data preprocessing procedure, PINNs can robustly achieve higher prediction accuracy for all flow quantities through the entire training process, distinctly improving the utilization of limited training data. The proposed normalization method requires zero extra computational cost. Though only verified in Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, this method holds potential for application to various other equations.">

        <tr id="Domain decomposition provides an effective way to tackle the dilemma of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) which struggle to accurately and efficiently solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in the whole domain, but the lack of efficient tools for dealing with the interfaces between two adjacent sub-domains heavily hinders the training effects, even leads to the discontinuity of the learned solutions. In this paper, we propose a symmetry group based domain decomposition strategy to enhance the PINN for solving the forward and inverse problems of the PDEs possessing a Lie symmetry group. Specifically, for the forward problem, we first deploy the symmetry group to generate the dividing-lines having known solution information which can be adjusted flexibly and are used to divide the whole training domain into a finite number of non-overlapping sub-domains, then utilize the PINN and the symmetry-enhanced PINN methods to learn the solutions in each sub-domain and finally stitch them to the overall solution of PDEs. For the inverse problem, we first utilize the symmetry group acting on the data of the initial and boundary conditions to generate labeled data in the interior domain of PDEs and then find the undetermined parameters as well as the solution by only training the neural networks in a sub-domain. Consequently, the proposed method can predict high-accuracy solutions of PDEs which are failed by the vanilla PINN in the whole domain and the extended physics-informed neural network in the same sub-domains. Numerical results of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with a translation symmetry and the nonlinear viscous fluid equation with a scaling symmetry show that the accuracies of the learned solutions are improved largely.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a novel and popular approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, achieving stable training and obtaining correct results remain a challenge in many cases, often attributed to the ill-conditioning of PINNs. Nonetheless, further analysis is still lacking, severely limiting the progress and applications of PINNs in complex engineering problems. Drawing inspiration from the ill-conditioning analysis in traditional numerical methods, we establish a connection between the ill-conditioning of PINNs and the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian matrix of the PDE system. Specifically, for any given PDE system, we construct its controlled system. This controlled system allows for adjustment of the condition number of the Jacobian matrix while retaining the same solution as the original system. Our numerical findings suggest that the ill-conditioning observed in PINNs predominantly stems from that of the Jacobian matrix. As the condition number of the Jacobian matrix decreases, the controlled systems exhibit faster convergence rates and higher accuracy. Building upon this understanding and the natural extension of controlled systems, we present a general approach to mitigate the ill-conditioning of PINNs, leading to successful simulations of the three-dimensional flow around the M6 wing at a Reynolds number of 5,000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PINNs have been successful in simulating such complex systems, offering a promising new technique for addressing industrial complexity problems. Our findings also offer valuable insights guiding the future development of PINNs.">

However, the training of neural operators typically demands large training datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, physics-informed training can offer a cost-effective strategy. However, current physics-informed neural operators face limitations, either in handling irregular domain shapes or in generalization to various discretizations of PDE parameters with variable mesh sizes. In this research, we introduce a novel physics-informed model architecture which can generalize to parameter discretizations of variable size and irregular domain shapes. Particularly, inspired by deep operator neural networks, our model involves a discretization-independent learning of parameter embedding repeatedly, and this parameter embedding is integrated with the response embeddings through multiple compositional layers, for more expressivity.

Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems.

This time-dependent surrogate model is inspired by the motion of a harmonic oscillator. For this study, we further compare the physics-based approach with a purely data-driven method, revealing the significance of physical laws for the extrapolation capabilities of models in scenarios with limited access to experimental data. Furthermore, we identify the natural frequency of the system by utilizing the physics-based model as an inverse solver. For the second surrogate model, we then focus on a fixed instance in time and combine the sensor data with the equations of linear elasticity to predict the strain distribution within the beam. This example reveals the importance of balancing different loss components through the selection of suitable loss weights.">

        <tr id="This study introduces a computational approach leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for the efficient computation of arterial blood flows, particularly focusing on solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by using the domain decomposition technique. Unlike conventional computational fluid dynamics methods, PINNs offer advantages by eliminating the need for discretized meshes and enabling the direct solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we propose the weighted Extended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WXPINNs) and weighted Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WCPINNs), tailored for detailed hemodynamic simulations based on generalized space-time domain decomposition techniques. The inclusion of multiple neural networks enhances the representation capacity of the weighted PINN methods. Furthermore, the weighted PINNs can be efficiently trained in parallel computing frameworks by employing separate neural networks for each sub-domain. We show that PINNs simulation results circumvent backflow instabilities, underscoring a notable advantage of employing PINNs over traditional numerical methods to solve such complex blood flow models. They naturally address such challenges within their formulations. The presented numerical results demonstrate that the proposed weighted PINNs outperform traditional PINNs settings, where sub-PINNs are applied to each subdomain separately. This study contributes to the integration of deep learning methodologies with fluid mechanics, paving the way for accurate and efficient high-fidelity simulations in biomedical applications, particularly in modeling arterial blood flow.">

This framework, named relaxation neural networks(RelaxNN), is a simple and scalable extension of physics-informed neural networks(PINN). It is shown later that a typical PINN framework struggles to handle shock waves that arise in hyperbolic systems' solutions. This ultimately results in the failure of optimization that is based on gradient descent in the training process. Relaxation systems provide a smooth asymptotic to the discontinuity solution, under the expectation that macroscopic problems can be solved from a microscopic perspective. Based on relaxation systems, the RelaxNN framework alleviates the conflict of losses in the training process of the PINN framework.

Inexpensive to evaluate, POD-DL-ROMs are also relatively fast to train, thanks to their limited complexity. However, POD-DL-ROMs account for the physical laws governing the problem at hand only through the training data, that are usually obtained through a full order model (FOM) relying on a high-fidelity discretization of the underlying equations. Moreover, the accuracy of POD-DL-ROMs strongly depends on the amount of available data. In this paper, we consider a major extension of POD-DL-ROMs by enforcing the fulfillment of the governing physical laws in the training process -- that is, by making them physics-informed -- to compensate for possible scarce and/or unavailable data and improve the overall reliability. To do that, we first complement POD-DL-ROMs with a trunk net architecture, endowing them with the ability to compute the problem's solution at every point in the spatial domain, and ultimately enabling a seamless computation of the physics-based loss by means of the strong continuous formulation. Then, we introduce an efficient training strategy that limits the notorious computational burden entailed by a physics-informed training phase. In particular, we take advantage of the few available data to develop a low-cost pre-training procedure; then, we fine-tune the architecture in order to further improve the prediction reliability. Accuracy and efficiency of the resulting pre-trained physics-informed DL-ROMs (PTPI-DL-ROMs) are then assessed on a set of test cases ranging from non-affinely parametrized advection-diffusion-reaction equations, to nonlinear problems like the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flows.">

        <tr id="The $L^2$ gradient flow of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional leads to the Allen Cahn equation that is widely used for modeling phase separation. Machine learning methods for solving the Allen-Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives through automatic differentiation, and the large system size required by the space-time approach. To overcome these limitations, we propose a separable neural network-based approximation of the phase field in a minimizing movement scheme to solve the aforementioned gradient flow problem. At each time step, the separable neural network is used to approximate the phase field in space through a low-rank tensor decomposition thereby accelerating the derivative calculations. The minimizing movement scheme naturally allows for the use of Gauss quadrature technique to compute the functional. A `$tanh$' transformation is applied on the neural network-predicted phase field to strictly bounds the solutions within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, a theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that bounding the solution through this transformation is the key to effectively model sharp interfaces through separable neural network. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for phase separation problems and is an order of magnitude faster than the finite element method.">

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a highly active research topic across multiple disciplines in science and engineering, including computational geomechanics. PINNs offer a promising approach in different applications where faster, near real-time or real-time numerical prediction is required. Examples of such areas in geomechanics include geotechnical design optimization, digital twins of geo-structures and stability prediction of monitored slopes. But there remain challenges in training of PINNs, especially for problems with high spatial and temporal complexity. In this paper, we study how the training of PINNs can be improved by using an idealized poroelasticity problem as a demonstration example. A curriculum training strategy is employed where the PINN model is trained gradually by dividing the training data into intervals along the temporal dimension. We find that the PINN model with curriculum training takes nearly half the time required for training compared to conventional training over the whole solution domain. For the particular example here, the quality of the predicted solution was found to be good in both training approaches, but it is anticipated that the curriculum training approach has the potential to offer a better prediction capability for more complex problems, a subject for further research.">

In the context of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a significant innovation, enabling data-driven fluid simulations while incorporating physics-based laws described by partial differential equations (PDEs). While PINNs have demonstrated efficacy in various fluid flow scenarios, a noticeable gap exists in their application to simulate jet flows - an essential category in engineering. Jets, crucial for downburst outflow, ventilation, and heat transfer, lack comprehensive exploration through PINNs in existing literature. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the application of PINNs to simulate steady jet flows, specifically 2D planar turbulent jet flow scenarios. The novelty lies not only in adapting PINNs for simulating jet flows but also in overcoming challenges such as poor convergence during training, attributed to imbalances in loss terms. We propose a novel PINN architecture for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation of steady turbulent jet flows, without the need for turbulence models and simulation data. Additionally, an extended dynamic weighting strategy is introduced to enhance the balance of loss term contributions in the PINN, resulting in improved convergence and more accurate predictions.">

        <tr id="Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning (SciML) combines the powerful predictive power of SciML with methods for quantifying the reliability of the learned models. However, two major challenges remain: limited interpretability and expensive training procedures. We provide a new interpretation for UQ problems by establishing a new theoretical connection between some Bayesian inference problems arising in SciML and viscous Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs). Namely, we show that the posterior mean and covariance can be recovered from the spatial gradient and Hessian of the solution to a viscous HJ PDE. As a first exploration of this connection, we specialize to Bayesian inference problems with linear models, Gaussian likelihoods, and Gaussian priors. In this case, the associated viscous HJ PDEs can be solved using Riccati ODEs, and we develop a new Riccati-based methodology that provides computational advantages when continuously updating the model predictions. Specifically, our Riccati-based approach can efficiently add or remove data points to the training set invariant to the order of the data and continuously tune hyperparameters. Moreover, neither update requires retraining on or access to previously incorporated data. We provide several examples from SciML involving noisy data and \textit{epistemic uncertainty} to illustrate the potential advantages of our approach. In particular, this approach's amenability to data streaming applications demonstrates its potential for real-time inferences, which, in turn, allows for applications in which the predicted uncertainty is used to dynamically alter the learning process.">

Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples.

Yet, a notable challenge with existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods for data fidelity enhancement is their reliance on specific low-fidelity data patterns and distributions during the training phase. In addition, the CNN-based method essentially treats the flow reconstruction task as a computer vision task that prioritizes the element-wise precision which lacks a physical and mathematical explanation. This dependence can dramatically affect the models' effectiveness in real-world scenarios, especially when the low-fidelity input deviates from the training data or contains noise not accounted for during training. The introduction of diffusion models in this context shows promise for improving performance and generalizability. Unlike direct mapping from a specific low-fidelity to a high-fidelity distribution, diffusion models learn to transition from any low-fidelity distribution towards a high-fidelity one. Our proposed model - Physics-informed Residual Diffusion, demonstrates the capability to elevate the quality of data from both standard low-fidelity inputs, to low-fidelity inputs with injected Gaussian noise, and randomly collected samples. By integrating physics-based insights into the objective function, it further refines the accuracy and the fidelity of the inferred high-quality data. Experimental results have shown that our approach can effectively reconstruct high-quality outcomes for two-dimensional turbulent flows from a range of low-fidelity input conditions without requiring retraining.">

Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework.

        <tr id="In this work, we introduce a novel application of foundation models in the domain of nonlinear chemical process modeling. Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting. Furthermore, our method achieves rapid adaptation to new CSTRs, BRs, and PFRs using only a few data samples from the designated tasks.

        <tr id="We propose a generative flow-induced neural architecture search algorithm. The proposed approach devices simple feed-forward neural networks to learn stochastic policies to generate sequences of architecture hyperparameters such that the generated states are in proportion with the reward from the terminal state. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed search algorithm on the wavelet neural operator (WNO), where we learn a policy to generate a sequence of hyperparameters like wavelet basis and activation operators for wavelet integral blocks. While the trajectory of the generated wavelet basis and activation sequence is cast as flow, the policy is learned by minimizing the flow violation between each state in the trajectory and maximizing the reward from the terminal state. In the terminal state, we train WNO simultaneously to guide the search. We propose to use the exponent of the negative of the WNO loss on the validation dataset as the reward function. While the grid search-based neural architecture generation algorithms foresee every combination, the proposed framework generates the most probable sequence based on the positive reward from the terminal state, thereby reducing exploration time. Compared to reinforcement learning schemes, where complete episodic training is required to get the reward, the proposed algorithm generates the hyperparameter trajectory sequentially. Through four fluid mechanics-oriented problems, we illustrate that the learned policies can sample the best-performing architecture of the neural operator, thereby improving the performance of the vanilla wavelet neural operator.">

 A reliable means of hydrate plugging risk assessment in pipelines is critical to the modern practice of production in the hydrate management regime. Flow assurance engineers utilize computationally expensive multiphase flow simulations to characterize hydrate formation at desired conditions, however, there is no numerical method to assess the risk of a plug occurring from these results. Traditional machine learning models have shown reasonably accurate plugging risk classification and require just milliseconds to return an assessment. Despite this, there has been limited industry use due to concerns about the statistical nature of predictions and the sparsity of available training data.
 Deep neural networks (DNNs) are a purely data-driven machine learning model that require large quantities of labeled data to make accurate statistical predictions in their trained domain. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a variation of DNNs in which training additionally considers embedded domain physics, in the form of partial differential equations, to increase accuracy, lessen reliance on training data, and ground predictions. This work presents a PINN that has been trained to predict hydrate plugging risk. Training was directed by the mean squared error of the model's prediction against flowloop data and, critically, the residual of the hydrate intrinsic kinetics equation. The trained model showed improved accuracy over reference DNNs. A PINN of novel architecture embedded with the hydrate intrinsic kinetics equation was built in TensorFlow. Flowloop data from pilot-scale flowloops was used for the training and evaluation of the presented PINN. Performance was compared to two DNNs for plugging risk assessment. DNN1 was an earlier model presented at OTC 2019. DNN2 features identical architecture to the subject PINN but absent of the embedded physics. DNN1 was employed as a baseline for plugging risk assessment performance, whereas DNN2 was used to isolate the contribution of the embedded domain knowledge on inference accuracy. The PINN showed a plugging risk assessment accuracy of 98.7%, which is a meaningful improvement over the 95.0% accuracy offered by DNN1. Moreover, case studies show improved confidence in plug prediction. The effect of the embedded physics on model accuracy is quantified by a reduction in mean squared error of 13.3% in inference of hydrate volume fraction when compared to DNN2. These findings indicate that the increased accuracy is the result of the embedding of the hydrate intrinsic kinetics equation as well as the novel network architecture. Two additional PINNs were presented, further establish the superior behavior of PINNs in learning the solution to PDEs and under data-sparse conditions. This work provides a new approach for machine learning in hydrates by demonstrating a technique to accurately train neural networks through a combination of empirical data and domain knowledge. This line of research could ultimately lead to more informed quantification of hydrate plugging risk.">

        <tr id="Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.">

        <tr id="A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA). In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems. The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible. Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy. This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills. With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty. Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems. Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.">

One advantage of the neural network method for PDEs lies in its automatic differentiation (AD), which necessitates only the sample points themselves, unlike traditional finite difference (FD) approximations that require nearby local points to compute derivatives. In this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of AD in training neural networks. The concept of truncated entropy is introduced to characterize the training property. Specifically, through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses conducted on random feature models and two-layer neural networks, we discover that the defined truncated entropy serves as a reliable metric for quantifying the residual loss of random feature models and the training speed of neural networks for both AD and FD methods. Our experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that, from a training perspective, AD outperforms FD in solving partial differential equations.">

Within dynamical systems, neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where the system equations are set to be governed by a neural network, have become a popular tool for this challenge in recent years. However, less emphasis has been placed on systems that are only partially-observed. In this work, we employ a hybrid neural ODE structure, where the system equations are governed by a combination of a neural network and domain-specific knowledge, together with symbolic regression (SR), to learn governing equations of partially-observed dynamical systems. We test this approach on two case studies: A 3-dimensional model of the Lotka-Volterra system and a 5-dimensional model of the Lorenz system. We demonstrate that the method is capable of successfully learning the true underlying governing equations of unobserved states within these systems, with robustness to measurement noise.">

SymPDE alleviates the challenges PINNs face in fitting high-frequency and steeply changing functions. To our knowledge, no prior work has implemented this approach.

To train the model, a dataset using a real-world quadrotor carrying a slung load was curated and is made available. Prediction results are presented and corroborate the feasibility of the approach.

We then use the physics-informed neural networks and stochastic gradient descent methods to learn the tensor networks. One essential step is to determine a proper truncated bounded domain or numerical support for the Fokker-Planck equation.

        <tr id="The mass loss of the polar ice sheets contributes considerably to ongoing sea-level rise and changing ocean circulation, leading to coastal flooding and risking the homes and livelihoods of tens of millions of people globally. To address the complex problem of ice behavior, physical models and data-driven models have been proposed in the literature. Although traditional physical models can guarantee physically meaningful results, they have limitations in producing high-resolution results. On the other hand, data-driven approaches require large amounts of high-quality and labeled data, which is rarely available in the polar regions. Hence, as a promising framework that leverages the advantages of physical models and data-driven methods, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has been widely studied in recent years. In this paper, we review the existing algorithms of PIML, provide our own taxonomy based on the methods of combining physics and data-driven approaches, and analyze the advantages of PIML in the aspects of accuracy and efficiency. Further, our survey discusses some current challenges and highlights future opportunities, including PIML on sea ice studies, PIML with different combination methods and backbone networks, and neural operator methods.">

In this paper, we introduce a PINN-based deep learning approach to reconstruct one-dimensional rough surfaces from field data illuminated by an electromagnetic incident wave. In the proposed algorithm, the rough surface is approximated by a neural network, with which the spatial derivatives of surface function can be obtained via automatic differentiation and then the scattered field can be calculated via the method of moments. The neural network is trained by minimizing the loss between the calculated and the observed field data. Furthermore, the proposed method is an unsupervised approach, independent of any surface data, rather only the field data is used. Both TE field (Dirichlet boundary condition) and TM field (Neumann boundary condition) are considered. Two types of field data are used here: full scattered field data and phaseless total field data. The performance of the method is verified by testing with Gaussian-correlated random rough surfaces. Numerical results demonstrate that the PINN-based method can recover rough surfaces with great accuracy and is robust with respect to a wide range of problem regimes.">

This paper employs a greedy sampling approach based on the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method to identify the most informative samples in a dataset associated with a partial differential equation to estimate its parameters. Greedy samples are used to train a physics-informed neural network architecture which maps the nonlinear relation between spatio-temporal data and the measured values. To prove the impact of greedy samples on the training of the physics-informed neural network for parameter estimation of a partial differential equation, their performance is compared with random samples taken from the given dataset. Our simulation results show that for all considered partial differential equations, greedy samples outperform random samples, i.e., we can estimate parameters with a significantly lower number of samples while simultaneously reducing the relative estimation error. A Python package is also prepared to support different phases of the proposed algorithm, including data prepossessing, greedy sampling, neural network training, and comparison.">

        <tr id="The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network theories has revolutionized the way software is programmed, shifting from a hard-coded series of codes to a vast neural network. However, this transition in engineering software has faced challenges such as data scarcity, multi-modality of data, low model accuracy, and slow inference. Here, we propose a new network based on interpolation theories and tensor decomposition, the interpolating neural network (INN). Instead of interpolating training data, a common notion in computer science, INN interpolates interpolation points in the physical space whose coordinates and values are trainable. It can also extrapolate if the interpolation points reside outside of the range of training data and the interpolation functions have a larger support domain. INN features orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters, faster training, a smaller memory footprint, and higher model accuracy compared to feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or physics-informed neural networks (PINN). INN is poised to usher in Engineering Software 2.0, a unified neural network that spans various domains of space, time, parameters, and initial/boundary conditions. This has previously been computationally prohibitive due to the exponentially growing number of trainable parameters, easily exceeding the parameter size of ChatGPT, which is over 1 trillion. INN addresses this challenge by leveraging tensor decomposition and tensor product, with adaptable network architecture.">

        <tr id="Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs and susceptibility to local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

To overcome this challenge, in this paper, leveraging the score-based generative diffusion model, we introduce a novel unsupervised inversion methodology tailored for solving inverse problems arising from PDEs. Our approach operates within the Bayesian inversion framework, treating the task of solving the posterior distribution as a conditional generation process achieved through solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of inversion results, we propose an ODE-based Diffusion Posterior Sampling inversion algorithm. The algorithm stems from the marginal probability density functions of two distinct forward generation processes that satisfy the same Fokker-Planck equation.

To address these challenges and improve solution accuracy, we propose an innovative approach called Annealed Adaptive Importance Sampling (AAIS) for computing the discretized PDE residuals of the cost functions, inspired by the Expectation Maximization algorithm used in finite mixtures to mimic target density. Our objective is to approximate discretized PDE residuals by strategically sampling additional points in regions with elevated residuals, thus enhancing the effectiveness and accuracy of PINNs.

However, they often fail to achieve the same level of accuracy as classical methods in solving differential equations. In this paper, we identify two sources of this issue in the case of Cauchy problems: the use of $L^2$ residuals as objective functions and the approximation gap of neural networks. We show that minimizing the sum of $L^2$ residual and initial condition error is not sufficient to guarantee the true solution, as this loss function does not capture the underlying dynamics. Additionally, neural networks are not capable of capturing singularities in the solutions due to the non-compactness of their image sets. This, in turn, influences the existence of global minima and the regularity of the network. We demonstrate that when the global minimum does not exist, machine precision becomes the predominant source of achievable error in practice. We also present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.">

An important part of the procedure is the minimization of the equation residual which includes, when the equation is time-dependent, a time sampling.

In this paper we take some prototypical examples and, under standard hypothesis concerning the neural network convergence, we show that the optimal time sampling follows a truncated exponential distribution. In particular we explain when the time sampling is best to be uniform and when it should not be.

        <tr id="This work addresses the scattering problem of an incident wave at a junction connecting two semi-infinite waveguides, which we intend to solve using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). As with other deep learning-based approaches, PINNs are known to suffer from a spectral bias and from the hyperbolic nature of the Helmholtz equation. This makes the training process challenging, especially for higher wave numbers. We show an example where these limitations are present. In order to improve the learning capability of our model, we suggest an equivalent formulation of the Helmholtz Boundary Value Problem (BVP) that is based on splitting the total wave into a tapered continuation of the incoming wave and a remaining scattered wave. This allows the introduction of an inhomogeneity in the BVP, leveraging the information transmitted during back-propagation, thus, enhancing and accelerating the training process of our PINN model. The presented numerical illustrations are in accordance with the expected behavior, paving the way to a possible alternative approach to predicting scattering problems using PINNs.">

In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.">

        <tr id="The study of operator learning involves the utilization of neural networks to approximate operators. Traditionally, the focus has been on single-operator learning (SOL). However, recent advances have rapidly expanded this to include the approximation of multiple operators using foundation models equipped with millions or billions of trainable parameters, leading to the research of multi-operator learning (MOL). In this paper, we present a novel distributed training approach aimed at enabling a single neural operator with significantly fewer parameters to effectively tackle multi-operator learning challenges, all without incurring additional average costs. Our method is applicable to various neural operators, such as Deep Operator Neural Networks (DON). The core idea is to independently learn the output basis functions for each operator using its dedicated data, while simultaneously centralizing the learning of the input function encoding shared by all operators using the entire dataset. Through a systematic study of five numerical examples, we compare the accuracy and cost of training a single neural operator for each operator independently versus training a MOL model using our proposed method. Our results demonstrate enhanced efficiency and satisfactory accuracy. Moreover, our approach illustrates that some operators with limited data can be more effectively constructed with the aid of data from analogous operators through MOL learning. This highlights another MOL's potential to bolster operator learning.">

The data-driven surrogate achieves similar accuracy and reduction in simulation time compared to a physics-based surrogate, without the constraint of requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying dynamic models.

The proliferation of converter-connected resources, however, adds significant additional degrees of non-linearity and complexity to these simulations. This drastically increases the computational time and the number of critical scenarios to be considered. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) have been shown to accelerate these simulations by several orders of magnitude. This paper introduces the first natural step to remove the barriers for using PINNs in time-domain simulations: it proposes the first method to integrate PINNs in conventional numerical solvers. Integrating PINNs into conventional solvers unlocks a wide range of opportunities. First, PINNs can substantially accelerate simulation time, second, the modeling of components with PINNs allows new ways to reduce privacy concerns when sharing models, and last, enhance the applicability of PINN-based surrogate modeling. We demonstrate the training, integration, and simulation framework for several combinations of PINNs and numerical solution methods, using the IEEE 9-bus system.">

Bayesian inference plays a crucial role in cosmological parameter estimation, providing a robust framework for extracting theoretical insights from observational data. However, its computational demands can be substantial, primarily due to the need for numerous likelihood function evaluations. Our proposed method utilizes the power of deep learning, employing feedforward neural networks to approximate the likelihood function dynamically during the Bayesian inference process. Unlike traditional approaches, our method trains neural networks on-the-fly using the current set of live points as training data, without the need for pre-training. This flexibility enables adaptation to various theoretical models and datasets. We perform simple hyperparameter optimization using genetic algorithms to suggest initial neural network architectures for learning each likelihood function. Once sufficient accuracy is achieved, the neural network replaces the original likelihood function. The implementation integrates with nested sampling algorithms and has been thoroughly evaluated using both simple cosmological dark energy models and diverse observational datasets. Additionally, we explore the potential of genetic algorithms for generating initial live points within nested sampling inference, opening up new avenues for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian inference methods.">

        <tr id="Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing outputs and gradients of deep models to satisfy target equations. Due to the limitation of numerical computation, PINNs are conventionally optimized on finite selected points. However, since PDEs are usually defined on continuous domains, solely optimizing models on scattered points may be insufficient to obtain an accurate solution for the whole domain. To mitigate this inherent deficiency of the default scatter-point optimization, this paper proposes and theoretically studies a new training paradigm as region optimization. Concretely, we propose to extend the optimization process of PINNs from isolated points to their continuous neighborhood regions, which can theoretically decrease the generalization error, especially for hidden high-order constraints of PDEs. A practical training algorithm, Region Optimized PINN (RoPINN), is seamlessly derived from this new paradigm, which is implemented by a straightforward but effective Monte Carlo sampling method. By calibrating the sampling process into trust regions, RoPINN finely balances sampling efficiency and generalization error. Experimentally, RoPINN consistently boosts the performance of diverse PINNs on a wide range of PDEs without extra backpropagation or gradient calculation.">

        <tr id="Transport phenomena (e.g., fluid flows) are governed by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) describing mass, momentum, and energy conservation, and are ubiquitous in many engineering applications. However, deep learning architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the simulation of these PDEs. This paper clearly articulates and then solves this incompatibility. The local-dependency of generic transport PDEs implies that it only involves local information to predict the physical properties at a location in the next time step. However, the deep learning architecture will inevitably increase the scope of information to make such predictions as the number of layers increases, which can cause sluggish convergence and compromise generalizability. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a distributed data scoping method with linear time complexity to strictly limit the scope of information to predict the local properties. The numerical experiments over multiple physics show that our data scoping method significantly accelerates training convergence and improves the generalizability of benchmark models on large-scale engineering simulations. Specifically, over the geometries not included in the training data for heat transferring simulation, it can increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 21.7 \% and that of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by 38.5 \% on average.">

        <tr id="The vibrational response of structural components carries valuable information about their underlying mechanical properties, health status and operational conditions. This underscores the need for the development of efficient physics-based inversion algorithms which, given a limited set of sensing data points and in the presence of measurement noise, can reconstruct the response at locations where measurement data is not available and/or identify the unknown mechanical properties. Addressing this challenge, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach. PINNs seamlessly integrate governing equations into their architecture and have gained significant interest in solving inversion problems. In the context of learning and inversion of multimodal, multiscale vibrational responses, this paper introduces a novel spectral extension of PINNs, utilizing Fourier basis functions in the wavenumber domain, commonly known as k-space. The proposed k-space PINN (k-PINN), offers a robust framework for adjusting complexity and wavenumber composition of the response. Notably, the spectral formulation of k-PINN, coupled with the generally sparse representation of vibrations in k-space, facilitate efficient reconstruction and learning of broadband vibrations and alleviate the spectral bias associated with standard PINN. Additionally, the spectral solution space introduced by k-PINN substantially reduces the computational cost associated with computing physics-informed loss terms. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on reconstructing the bending vibrational mode shapes of a thin composite laminate and identifying its effective bending stiffness coefficients. It is shown that the proposed k-PINN methodology outperforms the standard PINN in terms of both learning and computational efficiency.">

Therefore, relying on the existing theory leads to unjustified design choices and suboptimal performance. In this work, we analyze the residual loss by studying its characteristics at critical points to find the conditions that result in effective training of PINNs. Specifically, we first show that under certain conditions, the residual loss of PINNs can be globally minimized by a wide neural network. Furthermore, our analysis also reveals that an activation function with well-behaved high-order derivatives plays a crucial role in minimizing the residual loss. In particular, to solve a $k$-th order PDE, the $k$-th derivative of the activation function should be bijective. The established theory paves the way for designing and choosing effective activation functions for PINNs and explains why periodic activations have shown promising performance in certain cases. Finally, we verify our findings by conducting a set of experiments on several PDEs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nimahsn/pinns_tf2.">

NCFs leverage differentiability of the vector field with respect to the parameters, along with first-order Taylor expansion to allow any context vector to influence trajectories from other parameters.

The Malliavin derivatives of solution to a BSDE satisfy themselves another BSDE, resulting thus in a system of BSDEs. Such formulation requires the estimation of the solution, its gradient, and the Hessian matrix, represented by the triple of processes $\left(Y, Z, \Gamma\right).$ All the integrals within this system are discretized by using the Euler-Maruyama method. Subsequently, DNNs are employed to approximate the triple of these unknown processes. The DNN parameters are backwardly optimized at each time step by minimizing a differential learning type loss function, which is defined as a weighted sum of the dynamics of the discretized BSDE system, with the first term providing the dynamics of the process $Y$ and the other the process $Z$. An error analysis is carried out to show the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Various numerical experiments up to $50$ dimensions are provided to demonstrate the high efficiency. Both theoretically and numerically, it is demonstrated that our proposed scheme is more efficient compared to other contemporary deep learning-based methodologies, especially in the computation of the process $\Gamma$.">

To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.">

This method's integration of parametric space information significantly reduces the need for training data to effectively predict high-fidelity solutions from low-fidelity ones. In this study, we examine a two-dimensional steady-state heat transfer analysis within a highly heterogeneous materials microstructure. The heat conductivity coefficients for two different materials are condensed from a 101 x 101 grid to smaller grids. We then solve the boundary value problem on the coarsest grid using a pre-trained physics-informed neural operator network known as Finite Operator Learning (FOL). The resulting low-fidelity solution is subsequently upscaled back to a 101 x 101 grid using a newly designed enhanced autoencoder. The novelty of the developed enhanced autoencoder lies in the concatenation of heat conductivity maps of different resolutions to the decoder segment in distinct steps. Hence the developed algorithm is named microstructure-embedded autoencoder (MEA). We compare the MEA outcomes with those from finite element methods, the standard U-Net, and various other upscaling techniques, including interpolation functions and feedforward neural networks (FFNN). Our analysis shows that MEA outperforms these methods in terms of computational efficiency and error on test cases. As a result, the MEA serves as a potential supplement to neural operator networks, effectively upscaling low-fidelity solutions to high fidelity while preserving critical details often lost in traditional upscaling methods, particularly at sharp interfaces like those seen with interpolation.">

Hitherto, it has been separately addressed by employing operator learning surrogates for field prediction while using simulation-based inference (and its variants) for statistical parameter determination. Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.">

The training and tuning process of a DL network greatly affects the quality of the model, but how this process differs when using physics-based loss functions or regularization terms is not commonly discussed. In this manuscript, several PBR methods are implemented to enforce stress equilibrium on a network predicting the stress fields of a high elastic contrast composite. Models with PBR enforced the equilibrium constraint more accurately than a model without PBR, and the stress equilibrium converged more quickly. More importantly, it was observed that independently fine-tuning each implementation resulted in more accurate models. More specifically, each loss formulation and dataset required different learning rates and loss weights for the best performance. This result has important implications on assessing the relative effectiveness of different DL models and highlights important considerations when making a comparison between DL methods.">

However, at low temperature, when directly solving a stationary Fokker-Planck equation with more than two metastable states in the generalized potential landscape, the small eigenvalue introduces numerical difficulties due to a large condition number. To overcome these problems, we introduce the IGANN method, which uses a penalty of negative input gradient annealing during the training.

        <tr id="Motion prediction is critical for autonomous off-road driving, however, it presents significantly more challenges than on-road driving because of the complex interaction between the vehicle and the terrain. Traditional physics-based approaches encounter difficulties in accurately modeling dynamic systems and external disturbance. In contrast, data-driven neural networks require extensive datasets and struggle with explicitly capturing the fundamental physical laws, which can easily lead to poor generalization. By merging the advantages of both methods, neuro-symbolic approaches present a promising direction. These methods embed physical laws into neural models, potentially significantly improving generalization capabilities. However, no prior works were evaluated in real-world settings for off-road driving. To bridge this gap, we present PhysORD, a neural-symbolic approach integrating the conservation law, i.e., the Euler-Lagrange equation, into data-driven neural models for motion prediction in off-road driving. Our experiments showed that PhysORD can accurately predict vehicle motion and tolerate external disturbance by modeling uncertainties. It outperforms existing methods both in accuracy and efficiency and demonstrates data-efficient learning and generalization ability in long-term prediction.">

        <tr id="Time-dependent flow fields are typically generated by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, which is an extremely time-consuming process. However, the latent relationship between the flow fields is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations and can be described by an operator. We therefore train a deep operator network, or simply DeepONet, to learn the temporal evolution between flow snapshots. Once properly trained, given a few consecutive snapshots as input, the network has a great potential to generate the next snapshot accurately and quickly. Using the output as a new input, the network iterates the process, generating a series of successive snapshots with little wall time. Specifically, we consider 2D flow around a circular cylinder at Reynolds number 1000, and prepare a set of high-fidelity data using a high-order spectral/hp element method as ground truth. Although the flow fields are periodic, there are many small-scale features in the wake flow that are difficult to generate accurately. Furthermore, any discrepancy between the prediction and the ground truth for the first snapshots can easily accumulate during the iterative process, which eventually amplifies the overall deviations. Therefore, we propose two alternative techniques to improve the training of DeepONet. The first one enhances the feature extraction of the network by harnessing the"multi-head non-local block". The second one refines the network parameters by leveraging the local smooth optimization technique. Both techniques prove to be highly effective in reducing the cumulative errors and our results outperform those of the dynamic mode decomposition method.">

In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.">

However, for a classical PGNN, the penalization of the physics-guided part is at the output level, which leads to a conservative result as systems with highly similar state-transition functions, i.e. only slight differences in parameters, can have significantly different time-series outputs. Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.">

Recently, geometry-aware PINN-based approaches that employ the strong form of underlying physical system equations have been developed with the aim of integrating geometric information into PINNs. Despite ongoing research, the assessment of PINNs in problems with various geometries remains an active area of investigation. In this work, we introduce a novel physics-informed framework named the Geometry-Aware Deep Energy Method (GADEM) for solving structural mechanics problems on different geometries. As the weak form of the physical system equation (or the energy-based approach) has demonstrated clear advantages compared to the strong form for solving solid mechanics problems, GADEM employs the weak form and aims to infer the solution on multiple shapes of geometries. Integrating a geometry-aware framework into an energy-based method results in an effective physics-informed deep learning model in terms of accuracy and computational cost. Different ways to represent the geometric information and to encode the geometric latent vectors are investigated in this work. We introduce a loss function of GADEM which is minimized based on the potential energy of all considered geometries. An adaptive learning method is also employed for the sampling of collocation points to enhance the performance of GADEM. We present some applications of GADEM to solve solid mechanics problems, including a loading simulation of a toy tire involving contact mechanics and large deformation hyperelasticity. The numerical results of this work demonstrate the remarkable capability of GADEM to infer the solution on various and new shapes of geometries using only one trained model.">

These biases significantly increase the certainty of predictions, decrease the error made and allow considerably smaller datasets to be used.

One of the most effective ways, when dealing with physical phenomena, is to introduce physical principles of recognised validity into the network architecture. The problem becomes more complex without knowledge of the physical principles governing the phenomena under study. A very interesting possibility then is to turn to the principles of thermodynamics, which are universally valid, regardless of the level of abstraction of the description sought for the phenomenon under study. To ensure compliance with the principles of thermodynamics, there are formulations that have a long tradition in many branches of science. In the field of rheology, for example, two main types of formalisms are used to ensure compliance with these principles: one-generator and two-generator formalisms.

In this work, we propose a framework for estimating the temperature of a permanent magnet synchronous motor by combining neural networks with the differentiable physical thermal model, as well as utilizing the simulation results. In detail, we first implement a differentiable thermal model based on a lumped parameter thermal network within an automatic differentiation framework. Subsequently, we add a neural network to predict thermal resistances, capacitances, and losses in real time and utilize the thermal parameters’ optimized empirical values as the initial output values of the network to improve the accuracy and robustness of the final temperature estimation. We validate the conceivable advantages of the proposed method through extensive experiments based on both synthetic data and real-world data and then provide some further potential applications.">

        <tr id="The discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) from datasets has attracted increased attention. However, the discovery of governing equations from sparse data with high noise is still very challenging due to the difficulty of derivatives computation and the disturbance of noise. Moreover, the selection principles for the candidate library to meet physical laws need to be further studied. The invariance is one of the fundamental laws for governing equations. In this study, we propose an invariance constrained deep learning network (ICNet) for the discovery of PDEs. Considering that temporal and spatial translation invariance (Galilean invariance) is a fundamental property of physical laws, we filter the candidates that cannot meet the requirement of the Galilean transformations. Subsequently, we embedded the fixed and possible terms into the loss function of neural network, significantly countering the effect of sparse data with high noise. Then, by filtering out redundant terms without fixing learnable parameters during the training process, the governing equations discovered by the ICNet method can effectively approximate the real governing equations. We select the one-dimensional (1D) Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, the two-dimensional (2D) Burgers equation, the equation of two-dimensional channel flow over an obstacle, and the equation of three-dimensional (3D) intracranial aneurysm as examples to verify the superiority of the ICNet for fluid mechanics. Furthermore, we extend similar invariance methods to the discovery of wave equation (Lorentz Invariance) and verify it through single and coupled Klein–Gordon equation. The results show that the ICNet method with physical constraints exhibits excellent performance in governing equations discovery from sparse and noisy data.">

The HINTS method combines neural operators (NOs) with standard iterative solvers, e.g. Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel (GS), to achieve better performance by leveraging the spectral bias of neural networks. In HINTS, some iterations of the conventional iterative method are replaced by inferences of the pre-trained NO. In this work, we employ HINTS to solve the scattering problem for both 2D and 3D problems, where the standard iterative solver fails. We consider square and triangular scatterers of various sizes in 2D, and a cube and a model submarine in 3D. We explore and illustrate the extrapolation capability of HINTS in handling diverse geometries of the scatterer, which is achieved by training the NO on non-scattering scenarios and then deploying it in HINTS to solve scattering problems. The accurate results demonstrate that the NO in HINTS method remains effective without retraining or fine-tuning it whenever a new scatterer is given. Taken together, our results highlight the adaptability and versatility of the extended HINTS methodology in addressing diverse scattering problems.">

On the forward pass through a BNN, predictions (and their uncertainties) are made either by Monte Carlo sampling network weights from the learned posterior or by analytically propagating statistical moments through the network. Though flexible, Monte Carlo sampling is computationally expensive and can be infeasible or impractical under resource constraints or for large networks. While moment propagation can ameliorate the computational costs of BNN inference, it can be difficult or impossible for networks with arbitrary nonlinearities, thereby restricting the possible set of network layers permitted with such a scheme. In this work, we demonstrate a simple yet effective approach for propagating statistical moments through arbitrary nonlinearities with only 3 deterministic samples, enabling few-sample variational inference of BNNs without restricting the set of network layers used. Furthermore, we leverage this approach to demonstrate a novel nonlinear activation function that we use to inject physics-informed prior information into output nodes of a BNN.">

        <tr id="Adjoint methods have been the pillar of gradient-based optimization for decades. They enable the accurate computation of a gradient (sensitivity) of a quantity of interest with respect to all system's parameters in one calculation. When the gradient is embedded in an optimization routine, the quantity of interest can be optimized for the system to have the desired behaviour. Adjoint methods require the system's Jacobian, whose computation can be cumbersome, and is problem dependent. We propose a computational strategy to infer the adjoint sensitivities from data (observables), which bypasses the need of the Jacobian of the physical system. The key component of this strategy is an echo state network, which learns the dynamics of nonlinear regimes with varying parameters, and evolves dynamically via a hidden state. Although the framework is general, we focus on thermoacoustics governed by nonlinear and time-delayed systems. First, we show that a parameter-aware Echo State Network (ESN) infers the parameterized dynamics. Second, we derive the adjoint of the ESN to compute the sensitivity of time-averaged cost functionals. Third, we propose the Thermoacoustic Echo State Network (T-ESN), which hard constrains the physical knowledge in the network architecture. Fourth, we apply the framework to a variety of nonlinear thermoacoustic regimes of a prototypical system. We show that the T-ESN accurately infers the correct adjoint sensitivities of the time-averaged acoustic energy with respect to the flame parameters. The results are robust to noisy data, from periodic, through quasiperiodic, to chaotic regimes. A single network predicts the nonlinear bifurcations on unseen scenarios, and so the inferred adjoint sensitivities are employed to suppress an instability via steepest descent. This work opens new possibilities for gradient-based data-driven design optimization.">

The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated for both linear and nonlinear partial differential equations such as 1-D scalar advection-diffusion equation, 1-D Burgers equation and 2-D advection equation.

Although it managed to utilize the data to discover the two-dimensional (x,z) acoustic constant-density wave equation u_tt=v^2(u_xx+u_zz) (subscripts of the wavefield, u, are second derivatives in time and space) in a homogeneous medium, it did not provide the complete equation form, where the velocity term is represented by a coefficient rather than directly given by v^2. In this work, we redesign the framework, encoding both velocity information and candidate functional terms simultaneously. Thus, we use GA to simultaneously evolve the candidate functional and coefficient terms in the library. Also, we consider here the physics rationality and interpretability in the randomly generated potential wave equations, by ensuring that both-hand sides of the equation maintain balance in their physical units. We demonstrate this redesigned framework using the acoustic wave equation as an example, showing its ability to produce physically reasonable expressions of wave equations from noisy and sparsely observed data in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media.

 Numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) are instrumental for material structural design where extensive data screening is needed. However, traditional numerical methods demand significant computational resources, highlighting the need for innovative optimization algorithms to streamline design exploration. Direct gradient-based optimization algorithms, while effective, rely on design initialization and require complex, problem-specific sensitivity derivations. The advent of machine learning offers a promising alternative to handling large parameter spaces. To further mitigate data dependency, researchers have developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to learn directly from PDEs. However, the intrinsic continuity requirement of PINNs restricts their application in structural mechanics problems, especially for composite materials. Our work addresses this discontinuity issue by substituting the PDE residual with a weak formulation in the physics-informed training process. The proposed approach is exemplified in modeling digital materials, which are mathematical representations of complex composites that possess extreme structural discontinuity. This paper also introduces an interactive process that integrates physics-informed loss with design objectives, eliminating the need for pre-trained surrogate models or analytical sensitivity derivations. The results demonstrate that our approach can preserve the physical accuracy in data-free material surrogate modeling but also accelerates the direct optimization process without model pre-training.">

        <tr id="Machine learning techniques are being used as an alternative to traditional numerical discretization methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to fluid flow. Whilst numerical methods are higher fidelity, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning methods on the other hand are lower fidelity but provide significant speed-ups. The emergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in fluid dynamics has allowed scientists to directly use PDEs for evaluating loss functions in an unsupervised manner. The downfall of this approach is that the differential form of systems is invalid at regions of shock inherent in hyperbolic PDEs such as the compressible Euler equations. To circumvent this problem we propose a modification to PDE-based PINN losses by using a finite volume-based loss function that incorporates the flux of Godunov-type methods. These Godunov-type methods are also known as approximate Riemann solvers and evaluate intercell fluxes in an entropy-satisfying manner, yielding more physically accurate shocks. Our approach increases fidelity compared to using regularized PDE-based PINN losses, as tested on the 2D Riemann problem.">

Here we uncover a connection between operator learning architectures and conditioned neural fields from computer vision, providing a unified perspective for examining differences between popular operator learning models. We find that many commonly used operator learning models can be viewed as neural fields with conditioning mechanisms restricted to point-wise and/or global information. Motivated by this, we propose the Continuous Vision Transformer (CViT), a novel neural operator architecture that employs a vision transformer encoder and uses cross-attention to modulate a base field constructed with a trainable grid-based positional encoding of query coordinates. Despite its simplicity, CViT achieves state-of-the-art results across challenging benchmarks in climate modeling and fluid dynamics.

        <tr id="Rogue waves are important physical phenomena, which have wide applications in nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. We find that when using the original PINNs to study rogue waves of high dimensional PDEs, the prediction performance will become very poor, especially for high-order rogue waves due to that the randomness of selection of sample points makes insufficient use of the physical information describing the local sharp regions of rogue waves. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling physics-informed neural network method (ASPINN), which renders the points in local sharp regions to be selected sufficiently by a new adaptive search algorithm to lead to a prefect prediction performance. To valid the performance of our method, the (2+1)-dimensional CHKP equation is taken as an illustrative example. Experimental results reveal that the original PINNs can hardly be able to predict dynamical behaviors of the high-order rogue waves for the CHKP equation, but the ASPINN method can not only predict dynamical behaviors of these high-order rogue waves, but also greatly improve the prediction efficiency and accuracy to four orders of magnitude. Then, the data-driven inverse problem for the CHKP equation with different levels of corrupted noise is studied to show that the ASPINN method has good robustness. Moreover, some main factors affecting the neural network performance are discussed in detail, including the size of training data, the number of layers of the neural network, and the number of neurons per layer.">

        <tr id="This paper describes an emulator that uses a Stochastic Variational Gaussian process (SVGP) regression model to parameterize radiation in a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model that meteorologically models the Earth's weather system. The computation of radiative processes is very large, accounting for most of the total NWP model computation. Statistical emulators are surrogate models that represent simulators and can overcome the computational limitations of very complex simulators such as radiative processes. Recently, artificial neural network-based radiative transfer emulators have been developed, and in this study, a statistical model, GP, is used to develop a radiative transfer emulator. The GP model has the advantage of calculating the uncertainty of the prediction along with the prediction, so the uncertainty of the prediction can be utilized appropriately. However, the computational complexity of the conventional GP model is very high, making it difficult to apply to large data. To solve this problem, an approximate approach, the SVGP model, was utilized. To further reduce the dimensionality of the input variables, we used a combined neural network and SVGP model. As a result, the SVGP-based radiative physics emulator improved its accuracy by about 20% compared to the artificial neural network emulator. However, the computation speed was about 3 to 9 times slower than the neural network emulator, but it was faster than the computation speed of the NWP model. This suggests that statistical emulators can be used to replace NWP model simulators.">

In terms of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) based additive manufacturing (AM), a DT can predict the current and future states of the melt pool and the resulting defects corresponding to the input laser parameters, evolve itself by assimilating in-situ sensor data, and optimize the laser parameters to mitigate defect formation. In this paper, we present a deep neural operator enabled computational framework of the DT for closed-loop feedback control of the L-PBF process. This is accomplished by building a high-fidelity computational model to accurately represent the melt pool states, an efficient surrogate model to approximate the melt pool solution field, followed by an physics-based procedure to extract information from the computed melt pool simulation that can further be correlated to the defect quantities of interest (e.g., surface roughness). In particular, we leverage the data generated from the high-fidelity physics-based model and train a series of Fourier neural operator (FNO) based ML models to effectively learn the relation between the input laser parameters and the corresponding full temperature field of the melt pool. Subsequently, a set of physics-informed variables such as the melt pool dimensions and the peak temperature can be extracted to compute the resulting defects. An optimization algorithm is then exercised to control laser input and minimize defects. On the other hand, the constructed DT can also evolve with the physical twin via offline finetuning and online material calibration. Finally, a probabilistic framework is adopted for uncertainty quantification. The developed DT is envisioned to guide the AM process and facilitate high-quality manufacturing.">

We reformulate the HJB equations into a stochastic neural network learning process, i.e., training a control network and a value network such that the associated Hamiltonian process is minimized and the cost process becomes a martingale.To enforce the martingale property for the cost process, we employ an adversarial network and construct a loss function based on the projection property of conditional expectations. Then, the control/value networks and the adversarial network are trained adversarially, such that the cost process is driven towards a martingale and the minimum principle is satisfied for the control.Numerical results show that the proposed SOC-MartNet is effective and efficient for solving HJB-type equations and SOCP with a dimension up to $500$ in a small number of training epochs.">

Training this architecture with an integrated scheme makes it possible to successfully reproduce a full chemical pathway in a dynamical environment. mace outperforms its classical analogue on average by a factor 26.

        <tr id="Abstract. Accurate prediction of the resultant geometry in sheet metal forming simulation is necessary to achieve zero-defect production. To quantify the effect of process parameters on the final geometry, numerical methods are used to simulate the process outputs for a given set of process variables. Finite element methods are employed in process optimization and design exploration. However, these computationally expensive models are unhelpful for process control applications. Surrogate models allowing fast prediction of resultant geometry or stress distribution can be plausible solutions. In the current study, we propose a sequential surrogate model to fit the stress field as a function of the process variable and the initial spatial coordinates. The framework is composed of two surrogate models. First, an artificial neural network (ANN) evaluates the displacement and the strain. Then, a second surrogate is employed to fit the stress using input strain and displacement. Here, ANN and physics-informed neural networks (PINN) are compared concerning prediction accuracy for the second surrogate model. The PINN is enhanced with the equilibrium equations. The developed method is demonstrated using a v-bending process. The results show that both surrogate models return good approximations, with ANN showing slightly better results.">

Backpropagation through time (BPTT), the prevailing method, extends the backpropagation (BP) algorithm by unrolling the RNN over time. However, this approach suffers from significant drawbacks, including the need to interleave forward and backward phases and store exact gradient information. Furthermore, BPTT has been shown to struggle with propagating gradient information for long sequences, leading to vanishing gradients. An alternative strategy to using gradient-based methods like BPTT involves stochastically approximating gradients through perturbation-based methods. This learning approach is exceptionally simple, necessitating only forward passes in the network and a global reinforcement signal as feedback. Despite its simplicity, the random nature of its updates typically leads to inefficient optimization, limiting its effectiveness in training neural networks. In this study, we present a new approach to perturbation-based learning in RNNs whose performance is competitive with BPTT, while maintaining the inherent advantages over gradient-based learning. To this end, we extend the recently introduced activity-based node perturbation (ANP) method to operate in the time domain, leading to more efficient learning and generalization. Subsequently, we conduct a range of experiments to validate our approach. Our results show similar performance, convergence time and scalability when compared to BPTT, strongly outperforming standard node perturbation and weight perturbation methods. These findings suggest that perturbation-based learning methods offer a versatile alternative to gradient-based methods for training RNNs.">

Understanding feature learning from a theoretical viewpoint is an emerging field with many open questions. In this work we capture finite-width effects with a systematic theory of network kernels in deep non-linear neural networks. We show that the Bayesian prior of the network can be written in closed form as a superposition of Gaussian processes, whose kernels are distributed with a variance that depends inversely on the network width N . A large deviation approach, which is exact in the proportional limit for the number of data points $P = \alpha N \rightarrow \infty$, yields a pair of forward-backward equations for the maximum a posteriori kernels in all layers at once. We study their solutions perturbatively to demonstrate how the backward propagation across layers aligns kernels with the target. An alternative field-theoretic formulation shows that kernel adaptation of the Bayesian posterior at finite-width results from fluctuations in the prior: larger fluctuations correspond to a more flexible network prior and thus enable stronger adaptation to data. We thus find a bridge between the classical edge-of-chaos NNGP theory and feature learning, exposing an intricate interplay between criticality, response functions, and feature scale.">

This paper explores the application of novel operator learning methodologies to unravel the intricate dynamics of flame instability, particularly focusing on hybrid instabilities arising from the coexistence of Darrieus-Landau (DL) and Diffusive-Thermal (DT) mechanisms. Training datasets encompass a wide range of parameter configurations, enabling the learning of parametric solution advancement operators using techniques such as parametric Fourier Neural Operator (pFNO), and parametric convolutional neural networks (pCNN). Results demonstrate the efficacy of these methods in accurately predicting short-term and long-term flame evolution across diverse parameter regimes, capturing the characteristic behaviors of pure and blended instabilities. Comparative analyses reveal pFNO as the most accurate model for learning short-term solutions, while all models exhibit robust performance in capturing the nuanced dynamics of flame evolution. This research contributes to the development of robust modeling frameworks for understanding and controlling complex physical processes governed by nonlinear PDE.">

This task entails not only the accurate estimation of parameters, but also a suitable model structure. Recent work on the discovery of dynamical systems formulates this problem as a linear equation system. Here, we explore several simulation-based optimization approaches, which allow much greater freedom in the objective formulation and weaker conditions on the available data. We show that even for relatively small stochastic population models, simultaneous estimation of parameters and structure poses major challenges for optimization procedures. Particularly, we investigate the application of the local stochastic gradient descent method, commonly used for training machine learning models. We demonstrate accurate estimation of models but find that enforcing the inference of parsimonious, interpretable models drastically increases the difficulty. We give an outlook on how this challenge can be overcome.">

Training PINNs using this loss function is challenging as it typically requires selecting large numbers of points of different types, each with different training dynamics. Unlike past works that focused on the selection of either collocation or experimental points, this work introduces PINN Adaptive ColLocation and Experimental points selection (PINNACLE), the first algorithm that jointly optimizes the selection of all training point types, while automatically adjusting the proportion of collocation point types as training progresses. PINNACLE uses information on the interaction among training point types, which had not been considered before, based on an analysis of PINN training dynamics via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). We theoretically show that the criterion used by PINNACLE is related to the PINN generalization error, and empirically demonstrate that PINNACLE is able to outperform existing point selection methods for forward, inverse, and transfer learning problems.">

        <tr id="Of all the vector fields surrounding the minima of recurrent learning setups, the gradient field with its exploding and vanishing updates appears a poor choice for optimization, offering little beyond efficient computability. We seek to improve this suboptimal practice in the context of physics simulations, where backpropagating feedback through many unrolled time steps is considered crucial to acquiring temporally coherent behavior. The alternative vector field we propose follows from two principles: physics simulators, unlike neural networks, have a balanced gradient flow, and certain modifications to the backpropagation pass leave the positions of the original minima unchanged. As any modification of backpropagation decouples forward and backward pass, the rotation-free character of the gradient field is lost. Therefore, we discuss the negative implications of using such a rotational vector field for optimization and how to counteract them. Our final procedure is easily implementable via a sequence of gradient stopping and component-wise comparison operations, which do not negatively affect scalability. Our experiments on three control problems show that especially as we increase the complexity of each task, the unbalanced updates from the gradient can no longer provide the precise control signals necessary while our method still solves the tasks.

Existing models, however, only address narrowly tailored classes of problems and only scale to systems of a few dozen degrees of freedom (DoFs). Here, we demonstrate a single, unified model capable of addressing scattering simulations with thousands of DoFs, of any wavelength, any illumination wavefront, and freeform materials, within broad configurable bounds. Based on an attentional multi-conditioning strategy, our method also allows non-recurrent supervision on and prediction of intermediate physical states, which provides improved generalization with no additional data-generation cost. Using this O(1)-time intermediate prediction capability, we propose and prove a rigorous, efficiently computable upper bound on prediction error, allowing accuracy guarantees at inference time for all predictions. After training solely on randomized systems, we demonstrate the unified model across a suite of challenging multi-disciplinary inverse problems, finding strong efficacy and speed improvements up to 96% for problems in optical tomography, beam shaping through volumetric random media, and freeform photonic inverse design, with no problem-specific training. Our findings demonstrate a path to universal, verifiably accurate neural surrogates for existing scattering simulators, and our conditioning and training methods are directly applicable to any PDE admitting a time-domain iterative solver.">

        <tr id="Equation discovery is aimed at directly extracting physical laws from data and has emerged as a pivotal research domain. Previous methods based on symbolic mathematics have achieved substantial advancements, but often require the design of implementation of complex algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically mining governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse equations in string form, and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. In the optimization phase, we propose two alternately iterated strategies to optimize generated equations collaboratively. The first strategy is to take LLMs as a black-box optimizer and achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy is to instruct LLMs to perform evolutionary operators for global search. Experiments are extensively conducted on both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Results demonstrate that our framework can discover effective equations to reveal the underlying physical laws under various nonlinear dynamic systems. Further comparisons are made with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating good stability and usability. Our framework substantially lowers the barriers to learning and applying equation discovery techniques, demonstrating the application potential of LLMs in the field of knowledge discovery.">

This method integrates a Physics Informed Neural Operator (PINO) as a forward model within a sophisticated Cluster Classify Regress (CCR) framework. The process is enhanced by an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman Inversion (aREKI), optimized for rapid uncertainty quantification in reservoir history matching. This innovative workflow parameterizes unknown permeability and porosity fields, capturing non-Gaussian posterior measures with techniques such as a variational convolution autoencoder and the CCR. Serving as exotic priors and a supervised model, the CCR synergizes with the PINO surrogate to accurately simulate the nonlinear dynamics of Peaceman well equations. The CCR approach allows for flexibility in applying distinct machine learning algorithms across its stages. Updates to the PINO reservoir surrogate are driven by a loss function derived from supervised data, initial conditions, and residuals of governing black oil PDEs. Our integrated model, termed PINO-Res-Sim, outputs crucial parameters including pressures, saturations, and production rates for oil, water, and gas. Validated against traditional simulators through controlled experiments on synthetic reservoirs and the Norne field, the methodology showed remarkable accuracy. Additionally, the PINO-Res-Sim in the aREKI workflow efficiently recovered unknown fields with a computational speedup of 100 to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. The learning phase for PINO-Res-Sim, conducted on an NVIDIA H100, was impressively efficient, compatible with ensemble-based methods for complex computational tasks.">

        <tr id="Identifying Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) from measurement data requires both fitting the dynamics and assimilating, either implicitly or explicitly, the measurement data. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method involves a derivative estimation step (and optionally, smoothing) and a sparse regression step on a library of candidate ODE terms. Kalman smoothing is a classical framework for assimilating the measurement data with known noise statistics. Previously, derivatives in SINDy and its python package, pysindy, had been estimated by finite difference, L1 total variation minimization, or local filters like Savitzky-Golay. In contrast, Kalman allows discovering ODEs that best recreate the essential dynamics in simulation, even in cases when it does not perform as well at recovering coefficients, as measured by their F1 score and mean absolute error. We have incorporated Kalman smoothing, along with hyperparameter optimization, into the existing pysindy architecture, allowing for rapid adoption of the method. Numerical experiments on a number of dynamical systems show Kalman smoothing to be the most amenable to parameter selection and best at preserving problem structure in the presence of noise.">

Despite recent developments, complex phenomena such as high-Reynolds-number (high-[Formula: see text]) flow remain a modeling challenge without the use of high-fidelity inputs. In this study, a low-fidelity-influenced physics-informed neural network (LF-PINN) is proposed as a surrogate aerodynamic analysis model for inverse airfoil shape design at [Formula: see text]. The LF-PINN is developed in a hybrid approach using low-fidelity flowfields approximated from a viscous-inviscid coupled airfoil analysis tool (mfoil) and physics residuals from the steady, incompressible, two-dimensional Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. The approach is designed to alleviate offline computational costs by avoiding high-fidelity simulations and sustain predicting accuracy using corrections by the physics residuals. The LF-PINN is able to correct the low-fidelity flowfield quantities toward the ground truth, with a mean improvement of about 19% in pressure and about 5% in total velocity based on Euclidean distance comparisons. Evaluation of the airfoil surface pressure coefficient [Formula: see text] distributions shows corrections by the LF-PINN at the suction peak, which largely contributes to lifting forces. Inverse airfoil shape design is conducted using target [Formula: see text] distributions in the objective function, whereby the LF-PINN can approach the expected target shapes while reducing online computational time by at least an order of magnitude compared to direct airfoil analysis tools.">

While machine learning has proven its capabilities in generalizing the underlying non-linear dynamics of such systems, unlocking its predictive power is often restrained by the limited availability of large, curated datasets. To supplement real-world data, informing machine learning by transfer learning with data simulated from ordinary differential equations has emerged as a promising solution. However, the success of this approach highly depends on the designed characteristics of the synthetic data. Results We optimize dataset characteristics such as size, diversity, and noise of ordinary differential equation-based synthetic time series datasets in three relevant and representative biological systems. To achieve this, we here, for the first time, present a framework to systematically evaluate the influence of such design choices on transfer learning performance in one place. We achieve a performance improvement of up to 92% in mean absolute error for our optimized simulation-based transfer learning compared to non-informed deep learning. We find a strong interdependency between dataset size and diversity effects. The optimal transfer learning setting heavily relies on real-world data characteristics as well as its coherence with the synthetic data’s dynamics, emphasizing the relevance of such a framework.

We formulate the phase analysis as a regression task, address the question of generating data that reflects the different states of the physical system, and evaluate the performance of neural architecture search for this task. After obtaining the optimized architectures, we further implement smart data processing and analytics by means of neuron coverage metrics, assessing the capability of these metrics to estimate phase transitions.

In this work, we discuss the efficacy of Kernel Operator Learning (KOL) to reconstruct population dynamics during epidemic outbreaks, where the transmission rate is ruled by an input strategy. In particular, we introduce two surrogate models, named KOL-m and KOL-$\partial$, which reconstruct in two different ways the evolution of the epidemics. Moreover, we evaluate the generalization performances of the two approaches with different kernels, including the Neural Tangent Kernels, and compare them with a classical neural network model learning method. Employing synthetic but semi-realistic data, we show how the two introduced approaches are suitable for realizing fast and robust forecasts and scenario analyses, and how these approaches are competitive for determining optimal intervention strategies with respect to specific performance measures.">

This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go. NKDCD also utilizes sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights of the lag matrices, encouraging the model to select only the needed causal dependencies within the data. Through extensive testing on practically applicable datasets, it is shown that the NKDCD outperforms the existing nonlinear Granger causality discovery approaches.">

        <tr id="Machine learning (ML) offers promising new approaches to tackle complex problems and has been increasingly adopted in chemical and materials sciences. Broadly speaking, ML models employ generic mathematical functions and attempt to learn essential physics and chemistry from a large amount of data. Consequently, because of the lack of physical or chemical principles in the functional form, the reliability of the predictions is oftentimes not guaranteed, particularly for data far out of distribution. It is critical to quantify the uncertainty in model predictions and understand how the uncertainty propagates to downstream chemical and materials applications. Herein, we review and categorize existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for atomistic ML under a united framework of probabilistic modeling with the aim of elucidating the similarities and differences between them. We also discuss performance metrics to evaluate the calibration, precision, accuracy, and efficiency of the UQ methods and techniques for model recalibration. In addition, we discuss uncertainty propagation (UP) in widely used simulation techniques in chemical and materials science, such as molecular dynamics and microkinetic modeling. We also provide remarks on the challenges and future opportunities of UQ and UP in atomistic ML.">

        <tr id="The theory of forward–backward stochastic differential equations occupies an important position in stochastic analysis and practical applications. However, the numerical solution of forward–backward stochastic differential equations, especially for high-dimensional cases, has stagnated. The development of deep learning provides ideas for its high-dimensional solution. In this paper, our focus lies on the fully coupled forward–backward stochastic differential equation. We design a neural network structure tailored to the characteristics of the equation and develop a hybrid BiGRU model for solving it. We introduce the time dimension based on the sequence nature after discretizing the FBSDE. By considering the interactions between preceding and succeeding time steps, we construct the BiGRU hybrid model. This enables us to effectively capture both long- and short-term dependencies, thus mitigating issues such as gradient vanishing and explosion. Residual learning is introduced within the neural network at each time step; the structure of the loss function is adjusted according to the properties of the equation. The model established above can effectively solve fully coupled forward–backward stochastic differential equations, effectively avoiding the effects of dimensional catastrophe, gradient vanishing, and gradient explosion problems, with higher accuracy, stronger stability, and stronger model interpretability.">

This work shows that sequential-in-time training methods can be understood broadly as either optimize-then-discretize (OtD) or discretize-then-optimize (DtO) schemes, which are well known concepts in numerical analysis. The unifying perspective leads to novel stability and a posteriori error analysis results that provide insights into theoretical and numerical aspects that are inherent to either OtD or DtO schemes such as the tangent space collapse phenomenon, which is a form of over-fitting. Additionally, the unified perspective facilitates establishing connections between variants of sequential-in-time training methods, which is demonstrated by identifying natural gradient descent methods on energy functionals as OtD schemes applied to the corresponding gradient flows.">

        <tr id="Formulating dynamical models for physical phenomena is essential for understanding the interplay between the different mechanisms and predicting the evolution of physical states. However, a dynamical model alone is often insufficient to address these fundamental tasks, as it suffers from model errors and uncertainties. One common remedy is to rely on data assimilation, where the state estimate is updated with observations of the true system. Ensemble filters sequentially assimilate observations by updating a set of samples over time. They operate in two steps: a forecast step that propagates each sample through the dynamical model and an analysis step that updates the samples with incoming observations. For accurate and robust predictions of dynamical systems, discrete solutions must preserve their critical invariants. While modern numerical solvers satisfy these invariants, existing invariant-preserving analysis steps are limited to Gaussian settings and are often not compatible with classical regularization techniques of ensemble filters, e.g., inflation and covariance tapering. The present work focuses on preserving linear invariants, such as mass, stoichiometric balance of chemical species, and electrical charges. Using tools from measure transport theory (Spantini et al., 2022, SIAM Review), we introduce a generic class of nonlinear ensemble filters that automatically preserve desired linear invariants in non-Gaussian filtering problems. By specializing this framework to the Gaussian setting, we recover a constrained formulation of the Kalman filter. Then, we show how to combine existing regularization techniques for the ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994, J. Geophys. Res.) with the preservation of the linear invariants. Finally, we assess the benefits of preserving linear invariants for the ensemble Kalman filter and nonlinear ensemble filters.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we propose a structure-guided Gauss-Newton (SgGN) method for solving least squares problems using a shallow ReLU neural network. The method effectively takes advantage of both the least squares structure and the neural network structure of the objective function. By categorizing the weights and biases of the hidden and output layers of the network as nonlinear and linear parameters, respectively, the method iterates back and forth between the nonlinear and linear parameters. The nonlinear parameters are updated by a damped Gauss-Newton method and the linear ones are updated by a linear solver. Moreover, at the Gauss-Newton step, a special form of the Gauss-Newton matrix is derived for the shallow ReLU neural network and is used for efficient iterations. It is shown that the corresponding mass and Gauss-Newton matrices in the respective linear and nonlinear steps are symmetric and positive definite under reasonable assumptions. Thus, the SgGN method naturally produces an effective search direction without the need of additional techniques like shifting in the Levenberg-Marquardt method to achieve invertibility of the Gauss-Newton matrix. The convergence and accuracy of the method are demonstrated numerically for several challenging function approximation problems, especially those with discontinuities or sharp transition layers that pose significant challenges for commonly used training algorithms in machine learning.">

State-of-the-art DS learning methods ensure stability of the generated trajectories; however, they have three shortcomings: a) the DS is assumed to have a single attractor, which limits the diversity of tasks it can achieve, b) state derivative information is assumed to be available in the learning process and c) the state of the DS is assumed to be measurable at inference time. We propose a class of provably stable latent DS with possibly multiple attractors, that inherit the training methods of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, thus, dropping the dependency on state derivative information. A diffeomorphic mapping for the output and a loss that captures time-invariant trajectory similarity are proposed.

        <tr id="Despite the stunning progress recently in large-scale deep neural network applications, our understanding of their microstructure, 'energy' functions, and optimal design remains incomplete. Here, we present a new game-theoretic framework, called statistical teleodynamics, that reveals important insights into these key properties. The optimally robust design of such networks inherently involves computational benefit-cost trade-offs that are not adequately captured by physics-inspired models. These trade-offs occur as neurons and connections compete to increase their effective utilities under resource constraints during training. In a fully trained network, this results in a state of arbitrage equilibrium, where all neurons in a given layer have the same effective utility, and all connections to a given layer have the same effective utility. The equilibrium is characterized by the emergence of two lognormal distributions of connection weights and neuronal output as the universal microstructure of large deep neural networks. We call such a network the Jaynes Machine. Our theoretical predictions are shown to be supported by empirical data from seven large-scale deep neural networks. We also show that the Hopfield network and the Boltzmann Machine are the same special case of the Jaynes Machine.">

In doing this, the neural network can provide sufficiently accurate predictions about systems made up of multiple units, essentially scaling the model from a single unit to an assembly of many. To test this concept, we compare predictions of the deformation of a 5-actuator system from an FE model and from the physics-informed neural network. The neural network, which provides a prediction similar in accuracy to the FE equivalent, can more easily be adjusted to execute systems of greater quantities of units without drastic increases in computational consumption.

However, the quality of a neural network highly depends on the used training data. Noisy, insufficient, or biased training data leads to suboptimal results. We present a hybrid method that combines deep learning with iterated graph Laplacian and show its application in acoustic impedance inversion which is a routine procedure in seismic explorations. A neural network is used to obtain a first approximation of the underlying acoustic impedance and construct a graph Laplacian matrix from this approximation. Afterwards, we use a Tikhonov-like variational method to solve the impedance inversion problem where the regularizer is based on the constructed graph Laplacian. The obtained solution can be shown to be more accurate and stable with respect to noise than the initial guess obtained by the neural network. This process can be iterated several times, each time constructing a new graph Laplacian matrix from the most recent reconstruction. The method converges after only a few iterations returning a much more accurate reconstruction. We demonstrate the potential of our method on two different datasets and under various levels of noise. We use two different neural networks that have been introduced in previous works. The experiments show that our approach improves the reconstruction quality in the presence of noise.">

        <tr id="Metaheuristic techniques are capable of representing optimization frames with their specific theories as well as objective functions owing to their being adjustable and effective in various applications. Through the optimization of deep learning models, metaheuristic algorithms inspired by nature, imitating the behavior of living and non-living beings, have been used for about four decades to solve challenging, complex, and chaotic problems. These algorithms can be categorized as evolution-based, swarm-based, nature-based, human-based, hybrid, or chaos-based. Chaos theory, as a useful approach to understanding neural network optimization, has the basic idea of viewing the neural network optimization as a dynamical system in which the equation schemes are utilized from the space pertaining to learnable parameters, namely optimization trajectory, to itself, which enables the description of the evolution of the system by understanding the training behavior, which is to say the number of iterations over time. The examination of the recent studies reveals the importance of chaos theory, which is sensitive to initial conditions with randomness and dynamical properties that are principally emerging on the complex multimodal landscape. Chaotic optimization, in this regard, accelerates the speed of the algorithm while also enhancing the variety of movement patterns. The significance of hybrid algorithms developed through their applications in different domains concerning real-world phenomena and well-known benchmark problems in the literature is also evident. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms have also been applied to deep learning or deep neural networks (DNNs), a branch of machine learning. In this respect, the basic features of deep learning and DNNs and the extensive use of metaheuristic algorithms are overviewed and explained.

In the last few years, Neural Networks have become more common in different areas
due to their ability to learn intricate patterns and provide precise predictions. Nonetheless, creating
an efficient neural network model is a difficult task that demands careful thought of multiple
factors, such as architecture, optimization method, and regularization technique. This paper aims
to comprehensively overview the state-of-the-art artificial neural network (ANN) generation and
highlight key challenges and opportunities in machine learning applications. It provides a critical
analysis of current neural network model design methodologies, focusing on the strengths and
weaknesses of different approaches. Also, it explores the use of different deep neural networks
(DNN) in image recognition, natural language processing, and time series analysis. In addition,
the text explores the advantages of selecting optimal values for various components of an Artificial
Neural Network (ANN). These components include the number of input/output layers, the
number of hidden layers, the type of activation function used, the number of epochs, and the
model type selection. Setting these components to their ideal values can help enhance the model's
overall performance and generalization. Furthermore, it identifies some common pitfalls and limitations
of existing design methodologies, such as overfitting, lack of interpretability, and computational
complexity. Finally, it proposes some directions for future research, such as developing
more efficient and interpretable neural network architectures, improving the scalability of training
algorithms, and exploring the potential of new paradigms, such as Spiking Neural Networks,
quantum neural networks, and neuromorphic computing.

        <tr id="In this paper, we advance the understanding of neural network training dynamics by examining the intricate interplay of various factors introduced by weight parameters in the initialization process. Motivated by the foundational work of Luo et al. (J. Mach. Learn. Res., Vol. 22, Iss. 1, No. 71, pp 3327-3373), we explore the gradient descent dynamics of neural networks through the lens of macroscopic limits, where we analyze its behavior as width $m$ tends to infinity. Our study presents a unified approach with refined techniques designed for multi-layer fully connected neural networks, which can be readily extended to other neural network architectures. Our investigation reveals that gradient descent can rapidly drive deep neural networks to zero training loss, irrespective of the specific initialization schemes employed by weight parameters, provided that the initial scale of the output function $\kappa$ surpasses a certain threshold. This regime, characterized as the theta-lazy area, accentuates the predominant influence of the initial scale $\kappa$ over other factors on the training behavior of neural networks. Furthermore, our approach draws inspiration from the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) paradigm, and we expand its applicability. While NTK typically assumes that $\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{\log \kappa}{\log m}=\frac{1}{2}$, and imposes each weight parameters to scale by the factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}$, in our theta-lazy regime, we discard the factor and relax the conditions to $\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{\log \kappa}{\log m}>0$. Similar to NTK, the behavior of overparameterized neural networks within the theta-lazy regime trained by gradient descent can be effectively described by a specific kernel. Through rigorous analysis, our investigation illuminates the pivotal role of $\kappa$ in governing the training dynamics of neural networks.">

        <tr id="This article presents an in-depth analysis and evaluation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) when applied to replicate trajectories in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or other particle methods. This study focuses on several architectures—feedforward neural networks (FNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), time convolutions (TCs), self-attention (SA), graph neural networks (GNNs), neural ordinary differential equation (ODENets), and an example of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) model—assessing their effectiveness and limitations in understanding and replicating the underlying physics of particle systems. Through this analysis, this paper introduces a comprehensive set of criteria designed to evaluate the capability of ANNs in this context. These criteria include the minimization of losses, the permutability of particle indices, the ability to predict trajectories recursively, the conservation of particles, the model’s handling of boundary conditions, and its scalability. Each network type is systematically examined to determine its strengths and weaknesses in adhering to these criteria. While, predictably, none of the networks fully meets all criteria, this study extends beyond the simple conclusion that only by integrating physics-based models into ANNs is it possible to fully replicate complex particle trajectories. Instead, it probes and delineates the extent to which various neural networks can “understand” and interpret aspects of the underlying physics, with each criterion targeting a distinct aspect of this understanding.">

However, this approach tends to produce high-energy configurations, leads to entangled latent space dimensions, and generalizes poorly beyond the training set. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-supervised approach that directly minimizes the system's mechanical energy during training. We show that our method leads to learned subspaces that reflect physical equilibrium constraints, resolve overfitting issues of previous methods, and offer interpretable latent space parameters.">

        <tr id="Understanding the transition events between metastable states in complex systems is an important subject in the fields of computational physics, chemistry and biology. The transition pathway plays an important role in characterizing the mechanism underlying the transition, for example, in the study of conformational changes of bio-molecules. In fact, computing the transition pathway is a challenging task for complex and high-dimensional systems. In this work, we formulate the path-finding task as a cost minimization problem over a particular path space. The cost function is adapted from the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional so that it is able to deal with rough potential landscapes. The path-finding problem is then solved using a actor-critic method based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG). The method incorporates the potential force of the system in the policy for generating episodes and combines physical properties of the system with the learning process for molecular systems. The exploitation and exploration nature of reinforcement learning enables the method to efficiently sample the transition events and compute the globally optimal transition pathway. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using three benchmark systems including an extended Mueller system and the Lennard-Jones system of seven particles.">

        <tr id="Identifying latent interactions within complex systems is key to unlocking deeper insights into their operational dynamics, including how their elements affect each other and contribute to the overall system behavior. For instance, in neuroscience, discovering neuron-to-neuron interactions is essential for understanding brain function; in ecology, recognizing the interactions among populations is key for understanding complex ecosystems. Such systems, often modeled as dynamical systems, typically exhibit noisy high-dimensional and non-stationary temporal behavior that renders their identification challenging. Existing dynamical system identification methods often yield operators that accurately capture short-term behavior but fail to predict long-term trends, suggesting an incomplete capture of the underlying process. Methods that consider extended forecasts (e.g., recurrent neural networks) lack explicit representations of element-wise interactions and require substantial training data, thereby failing to capture interpretable network operators. Here we introduce Lookahead-driven Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability (LINOCS), a robust learning procedure for identifying hidden dynamical interactions in noisy time-series data. LINOCS integrates several multi-step predictions with adaptive weights during training to recover dynamical operators that can yield accurate long-term predictions. We demonstrate LINOCS' ability to recover the ground truth dynamical operators underlying synthetic time-series data for multiple dynamical systems models (including linear, piece-wise linear, time-changing linear systems' decomposition, and regularized linear time-varying systems) as well as its capability to produce meaningful operators with robust reconstructions through various real-world examples.">

        <tr id="In the framework of solid mechanics, the task of deriving material parameters from experimental data has recently re-emerged with the progress in full-field measurement capabilities and the renewed advances of machine learning. In this context, new methods such as the virtual fields method and physics-informed neural networks have been developed as alternatives to the already established least-squares and finite element-based approaches. Moreover, model discovery problems are starting to emerge and can also be addressed in a parameter estimation framework. These developments call for a new unified perspective, which is able to cover both traditional parameter estimation methods and novel approaches in which the state variables or the model structure itself are inferred as well. Adopting concepts discussed in the inverse problems community, we distinguish between all-at-once and reduced approaches. With this general framework, we are able to structure a large portion of the literature on parameter estimation in computational mechanics - and we can identify combinations that have not yet been addressed, two of which are proposed in this paper. We also discuss statistical approaches to quantify the uncertainty related to the estimated parameters, and we propose a novel two-step procedure for identification of complex material models based on both frequentist and Bayesian principles. Finally, we illustrate and compare several of the aforementioned methods with mechanical benchmarks based on synthetic and real data.">

To address this challenge, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach together with Graph Neural Network. We thus propose Neural Bond Graph Encoder (NBgE), a model agnostic physical-informed encoder tailored for multi-physics systems. It provides an unified framework for any multi-physics informed AI with a graph encoder readable for any deep learning model.

        <tr id="We use Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to study the relation between the modulus and phase of amplitudes in $2\to 2$ elastic scattering at fixed energies. Unlike previous approaches, we do not employ the integral relation imposed by unitarity, but instead train FNOs to discover it from many samples of amplitudes with finite partial wave expansions. When trained only on true samples, the FNO correctly predicts (unique or ambiguous) phases of amplitudes with infinite partial wave expansions. When also trained on false samples, it can rate the quality of its prediction by producing a true/false classifying index. We observe that the value of this index is strongly correlated with the violation of the unitarity constraint for the predicted phase, and present examples where it delineates the boundary between allowed and disallowed profiles of the modulus. Our application of FNOs is unconventional: it involves a simultaneous regression-classification task and emphasizes the role of statistics in ensembles of NOs. We comment on the merits and limitations of the approach and its potential as a new methodology in Theoretical Physics.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modelling techniques provide a method for deriving models of dynamical systems directly from complicated data streams. However, tracking and forecasting such data streams poses a significant challenge to most methods, as they assume the underlying process and model does not change over time. In this paper, we apply one such data-driven method, the Koopman autoencoder (KAE), to high-dimensional oscillatory data to generate a low-dimensional latent space and model, where the system's dynamics appear linear. This allows one to accurately track and forecast systems where the underlying model may change over time. States and the model in the reduced order latent space can then be efficiently updated as new data becomes available, using data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), in a technique we call the KAE EnKF. We demonstrate that this approach is able to effectively track and forecast time-varying, nonlinear dynamical systems in synthetic examples. We then apply the KAE EnKF to a video of a physical pendulum, and achieve a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. By generating effective latent space reconstructions, we find that we are able to construct accurate short-term forecasts and efficient adaptations to externally forced changes to the pendulum's frequency.">

To address the challenges, we propose Deep Data Consistency (DDC) to update the data consistency step with a deep learning model when solving inverse problems with diffusion models. By analyzing existing methods, the variational bound training objective is used to maximize the conditional posterior and reduce its impact on the diffusion process. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods in linear and non-linear tasks, DDC demonstrates its outstanding performance of both similarity and realness metrics in generating high-quality solutions with only 5 inference steps in 0.77 seconds on average. In addition, the robustness of DDC is well illustrated in the experiments across datasets, with large noise and the capacity to solve multiple tasks in only one pre-trained model.">

OpFlow enables robust and accurate uncertainty quantification via drawing posterior samples of the Gaussian process and subsequently mapping them into the data function space.

        <tr id="Causal representation learning promises to extend causal models to hidden causal variables from raw entangled measurements. However, most progress has focused on proving identifiability results in different settings, and we are not aware of any successful real-world application. At the same time, the field of dynamical systems benefited from deep learning and scaled to countless applications but does not allow parameter identification. In this paper, we draw a clear connection between the two and their key assumptions, allowing us to apply identifiable methods developed in causal representation learning to dynamical systems. At the same time, we can leverage scalable differentiable solvers developed for differential equations to build models that are both identifiable and practical. Overall, we learn explicitly controllable models that isolate the trajectory-specific parameters for further downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution classification or treatment effect estimation. We experiment with a wind simulator with partially known factors of variation. We also apply the resulting model to real-world climate data and successfully answer downstream causal questions in line with existing literature on climate change.">

We train a feed-forward neural network to compute integrals of highly oscillatory 1D functions. The training set is a parametric combination of functions with varying characters and oscillatory behavior degrees. Numerical examples show that these networks are FLOP-efficient for sufficiently oscillatory integrands with an average FLOP gain of 1000 FLOPs. The network calculates oscillatory integrals better than traditional quadrature methods under the same computational budget or number of floating point operations. We find that feed-forward networks of 5 hidden layers are satisfactory for a relative accuracy of 0.001. The computational burden of inference of the neural network is relatively small, even compared to inner-product pattern quadrature rules. We postulate that our result follows from learning latent patterns in the oscillatory integrands that are otherwise opaque to traditional numerical integrators.">

        <tr id="Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.">

        <tr id="In most applications of utilizing neural networks for mathematical optimization, a dedicated model is trained for each specific optimization objective. However, in many scenarios, several distinct yet correlated objectives or tasks often need to be optimized on the same set of problem inputs. Instead of independently training a different neural network for each problem separately, it would be more efficient to exploit the correlations between these objectives and to train multiple neural network models with shared model parameters and feature representations. To achieve this, this paper first establishes the concept of common information: the shared knowledge required for solving the correlated tasks, then proposes a novel approach for model training by adding into the model an additional reconstruction stage associated with a new reconstruction loss. This loss is for reconstructing the common information starting from a selected hidden layer in the model. The proposed approach encourages the learned features to be general and transferable, and therefore can be readily used for efficient transfer learning. For numerical simulations, three applications are studied: transfer learning on classifying MNIST handwritten digits, the device-to-device wireless network power allocation, and the multiple-input-single-output network downlink beamforming and localization. Simulation results suggest that the proposed approach is highly efficient in data and model complexity, is resilient to over-fitting, and has competitive performances.">

Traditional derivative-free optimization techniques often rely on strong assumptions about objective functions, thereby failing at optimizing non-convex systems beyond 100 dimensions. Here, we present a tree search method for derivative-free optimization that enables accelerated optimal design of high-dimensional complex systems. Specifically, we introduce stochastic tree expansion, dynamic upper confidence bound, and short-range backpropagation mechanism to evade local optimum, iteratively approximating the global optimum using machine learning models. This development effectively confronts the dimensionally challenging problems, achieving convergence to global optima across various benchmark functions up to 2,000 dimensions, surpassing the existing methods by 10- to 20-fold. Our method demonstrates wide applicability to a wide range of real-world complex systems spanning materials, physics, and biology, considerably outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. This enables efficient autonomous knowledge discovery and facilitates self-driving virtual laboratories. Although we focus on problems within the realm of natural science, the advancements in optimization techniques achieved herein are applicable to a broader spectrum of challenges across all quantitative disciplines.">

 To improve predictive machine learning-based models limited by sparse data, supplemental physics-related features are introduced into a deep neural network (DNN). While some approaches inject physics through differential equations or numerical simulation, improvements are possible using simplified relationships from engineering references. To evaluate this hypothesis, thin rectangular plates were simulated to generate training datasets. With plate dimensions and material properties as input features and fundamental natural frequency as the output, predictive performance of a data-driven DNN-based model is compared with models using supplemental inputs, such as modulus of rigidity. To evaluate model accuracy improvements, these additional features are injected into various DNN layers, and the network is trained with four different dataset sizes. When evaluated against independent data of similar features to the training sets, supplementation provides no statistically-significant prediction error reduction. However, notable accuracy gains occur when independent test data is of material and dimensions different from the original training set. Furthermore, when physics-enhanced data is injected into multiple DNN layers, reductions in mean error from 33.2% to 19.6%, 34.9% to 19.9%, 35.8% to 22.4%, and 43.0% to 28.4% are achieved for dataset sizes of 261, 117, 60, and 30, respectively, demonstrating potential for generalizability using a data supplementation approach. Additionally, when compared with other methods—such as linear regression and support vector machine (SVM) approaches—the physics-enhanced DNN demonstrates an order of magnitude reduction in percentage error for dataset sizes of 261, 117, and 60 and a 30% reduction for a size of 30 when compared with a cubic SVM model independently tested with data divergent from the training and validation set.">

This iterative change can be naturally interpreted as a trajectory in network space–a time series of networks–and thus the training algorithm (e.g., gradient descent optimization of a suitable loss function) can be interpreted as a dynamical system in graph space. In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime. Our findings are put in contrast to common wisdom on convergence properties of neural networks and dynamical systems theory.

        <tr id="In the context of structural health monitoring (SHM), the selection and extraction of damage-sensitive features from raw sensor recordings represent a critical step towards solving the inverse problem underlying the structural health identification. This work introduces a new way to enhance stochastic approaches to SHM through the use of deep neural networks. A learnable feature extractor and a feature-oriented surrogate model are synergistically exploited to evaluate a likelihood function within a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. The feature extractor undergoes a supervised pairwise training to map sensor recordings onto a low-dimensional metric space, which encapsulates the sensitivity to structural health parameters. The surrogate model maps the structural health parameters onto their feature description. The procedure enables the updating of beliefs about structural health parameters, effectively replacing the need for a computationally expensive numerical (finite element) model. A preliminary offline phase involves the generation of a labeled dataset to train both the feature extractor and the surrogate model. Within a simulation-based SHM framework, training vibration responses are cost-effectively generated by means of a multi-fidelity surrogate modeling strategy to approximate sensor recordings under varying damage and operational conditions. The multi-fidelity surrogate exploits model order reduction and artificial neural networks to speed up the data generation phase while ensuring the damage-sensitivity of the approximated signals. The proposed strategy is assessed through three synthetic case studies, demonstrating remarkable results in terms of accuracy of the estimated quantities and computational efficiency.">

Despite tremendous efforts, a neural network architecture with the ability to high-accurately solve these fully connected and extremely intractable problems on larger systems is still lacking. Here we propose a variational autoregressive architecture with a message passing mechanism, which can effectively utilize the interactions between spin variables. The new network trained under an annealing framework outperforms existing methods in solving several prototypical Ising spin Hamiltonians, especially for larger spin systems at low temperatures. The advantages also come from the great mitigation of mode collapse during the training process of deep neural networks.

The current research is devoted to solving the highly non‐linear equation using a physics‐informed neural network (PINN) approach. Using the proper dimensionless terms, the associated fin problem is transformed into a non‐dimensional system, and the resulting partial differential equation (PDE) is then numerically solved using the finite difference method (FDM). Using the data‐driven LSTM‐ML technique, the time‐dependent periodic heat transmission in the concave fin is also examined. The impact of various factors on the temperature profile of the concave extended surface is explained, and the results are visually displayed. The temperature distribution in the concave fin diminishes as the convection‐conduction parameter and radiation‐conduction parameter rise. As the amplitude and thermal conductivity parameters improve, so does the temperature of the concave fin. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that although LSTM‐ML and PINN closely matched the FDM findings during the training domain, only PINN with designed characteristics has the potential to predict accurately beyond the trained region by capturing the physics of the problem.">

The resulting dataset and smaller subsets of it are used for the training of a Fully Convolutional Neural Network. The trained models are shown to return quantitative predictions of $\rho$, not only in terms of convergence of the loss function during training, but also in validation and testing, with better results in the case of the larger dataset. Extensive tests are performed to assess the generalization capability of the Neural Network model when applied to profiles with localized features or assigned geometries not included in the original dataset. Moreover, its possible exploitation on domain sizes beyond the one used in the training is also analyzed in-depth. The conditions providing a one-to-one reproduction of the ground-truth $\rho(x)$ profiles computed by the Green's approximation are highlighted along with critical cases.

        <tr id="Physics-integrated generative modeling is a class of hybrid or grey-box modeling in which we augment the the data-driven model with the physics knowledge governing the data distribution. The use of physics knowledge allows the generative model to produce output in a controlled way, so that the output, by construction, complies with the physical laws. It imparts improved generalization ability to extrapolate beyond the training distribution as well as improved interpretability because the model is partly grounded in firm domain knowledge. In this work, we aim to improve the fidelity of reconstruction and robustness to noise in the physics integrated generative model. To this end, we use variational-autoencoder as a generative model. To improve the reconstruction results of the decoder, we propose to learn the latent posterior distribution of both the physics as well as the trainable data-driven components using planar normalizng flow. Normalizng flow based posterior distribution harnesses the inherent dynamical structure of the data distribution, hence the learned model gets closer to the true underlying data distribution. To improve the robustness of generative model against noise injected in the model, we propose a modification in the encoder part of the normalizing flow based VAE. We designed the encoder to incorporate scaled dot product attention based contextual information in the noisy latent vector which will mitigate the adverse effect of noise in the latent vector and make the model more robust. We empirically evaluated our models on human locomotion dataset [33] and the results validate the efficacy of our proposed models in terms of improvement in reconstruction quality as well as robustness against noise injected in the model.">

        <tr id="Data assimilation aims to estimate the states of a dynamical system by optimally combining sparse and noisy observations of the physical system with uncertain forecasts produced by a computational model. The states of many dynamical systems of interest obey nonlinear physical constraints, and the corresponding dynamics is confined to a certain sub-manifold of the state space. Standard data assimilation techniques applied to such systems yield posterior states lying outside the manifold, violating the physical constraints. This work focuses on particle flow filters which use stochastic differential equations to evolve state samples from a prior distribution to samples from an observation-informed posterior distribution. The variational Fokker-Planck (VFP) -- a generic particle flow filtering framework -- is extended to incorporate non-linear, equality state constraints in the analysis. To this end, two algorithmic approaches that modify the VFP stochastic differential equation are discussed: (i) VFPSTAB, to inexactly preserve constraints with the addition of a stabilizing drift term, and (ii) VFPDAE, to exactly preserve constraints by treating the VFP dynamics as a stochastic differential-algebraic equation (SDAE). Additionally, an implicit-explicit time integrator is developed to evolve the VFPDAE dynamics. The strength of the proposed approach for constraint preservation in data assimilation is demonstrated on three test problems: the double pendulum, Korteweg-de-Vries, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.">

        <tr id="Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are at the core of most Deep learning (DL) algorithms that successfully tackle complex problems like image recognition, autonomous driving, and natural language processing. However, unlike biological brains who tackle similar problems in a very efficient manner, DL algorithms require a large number of trainable parameters, making them energy-intensive and prone to overfitting. Here, we show that a new ANN architecture that incorporates the structured connectivity and restricted sampling properties of biological dendrites counteracts these limitations. We find that dendritic ANNs are more robust to overfitting and outperform traditional ANNs on several image classification tasks while using significantly fewer trainable parameters. This is achieved through the adoption of a different learning strategy, whereby most of the nodes respond to several classes, unlike classical ANNs that strive for class-specificity. These findings suggest that the incorporation of dendrites can make learning in ANNs precise, resilient, and parameter-efficient and shed new light on how biological features can impact the learning strategies of ANNs.">

        <tr id="Recent studies showed that the generalization of neural networks is correlated with the sharpness of the loss landscape, and flat minima suggests a better generalization ability than sharp minima. In this paper, we propose a novel method called \emph{optimum shifting}, which changes the parameters of a neural network from a sharp minimum to a flatter one while maintaining the same training loss value. Our method is based on the observation that when the input and output of a neural network are fixed, the matrix multiplications within the network can be treated as systems of under-determined linear equations, enabling adjustment of parameters in the solution space, which can be simply accomplished by solving a constrained optimization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a practical stochastic optimum shifting technique utilizing the Neural Collapse theory to reduce computational costs and provide more degrees of freedom for optimum shifting. Extensive experiments (including classification and detection) with various deep neural network architectures on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.">

Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.">

Further, the constraints of resonance are embedded into the inverse-design process based on the equivalent circuit model (ECM). In the uncertainty quantification process, both data uncertainty and model uncertainty of predicted S-parameters are modeled by the Bayesian neural network (BNN), whose effectiveness is verified by the correlation coefficient between true error and predicted uncertainty. At last, the inversely designed FSR sample is manufactured and measured, where the electromagnetic (EM) responses including S-parameters and absorption bands verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.">

Analyses of bulk and interfacial properties as well as many-body interactions characteristic of water elucidate inherent limitations in the transferability and predictive accuracy of DeePMD-based potentials. These limitations can be traced back to an incomplete implementation of the "nearsightedness of electronic matter" principle, which may be common throughout machine learning potentials that do not include a proper representation of self-consistently determined long-range electric fields. These findings provide further support for the "short-blanket dilemma" faced by DeePMD-based potentials, highlighting the challenges in achieving a balance between computational efficiency and a rigorous, physics-based representation of the properties of water.

Multiple coupling strategies have been developed to accelerate these simulations, but often use predictors in the form of simple finite-difference extrapolations.

Each reduced order model is composed of a nonlinear encoder-regressor-decoder architecture and is equipped with an adaptive update strategy that adds robustness for extrapolation. In doing so, the proposed methodology leverages physics-based insights from high-fidelity solvers, thus establishing a physics-aware machine learning predictor. Using three strongly coupled FSI examples, this study demonstrates the improved convergence obtained with the new predictor and the overall computational speedup realized compared to classical approaches.">

        <tr id="Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learn- ing models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irreg- ular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based mod- els, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experi- ments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.">

Purpose
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become a new tendency in flow simulation, because of their self-advantage of integrating both physical and monitored information of fields in solving the Navier–Stokes equation and its variants. In view of the strengths of PINN, this study aims to investigate the impact of spatially embedded data distribution on the flow field results around the train in the crosswind environment reconstructed by PINN.


Design/methodology/approach
PINN can integrate data residuals with physical residuals into the loss function to train its parameters, allowing it to approximate the solution of the governing equations. In addition, with the aid of labelled training data, PINN can also incorporate the real site information of the flow field in model training. In light of this, the PINN model is adopted to reconstruct a two-dimensional time-averaged flow field around a train under crosswinds in the spatial domain with the aid of sparse flow field data, and the prediction results are compared with the reference results obtained from numerical modelling.


Findings
The prediction results from PINN results demonstrated a low discrepancy with those obtained from numerical simulations. The results of this study indicate that a threshold of the spatial embedded data density exists, in both the near wall and far wall areas on the train’s leeward side, as well as the near train surface area. In other words, a negative effect on the PINN reconstruction accuracy will emerge if the spatial embedded data density exceeds or slips below the threshold. Also, the optimum arrangement of the spatial embedded data in reconstructing the flow field of the train in crosswinds is obtained in this work.


Originality/value
In this work, a strategy of reconstructing the time-averaged flow field of the train under crosswind conditions is proposed based on the physics-informed data-driven method, which enhances the scope of neural network applications. In addition, for the flow field reconstruction, the effect of spatial embedded data arrangement in PINN is compared to improve its accuracy.

        <tr id="Local-nonlocal coupling approaches combine the computational efficiency of local models and the accuracy of nonlocal models. However, the coupling process is challenging, requiring expertise to identify the interface between local and nonlocal regions. This study introduces a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect the regions in which the local and nonlocal models should be used in a coupling approach. This identification process uses the loading functions and provides as output the selected model at the grid points. Training is based on datasets of loading functions for which reference coupling configurations are computed using accurate coupled solutions, where accuracy is measured in terms of the relative error between the solution to the coupling approach and the solution to the nonlocal model. We study two approaches that differ from one another in terms of the data structure. The first approach, referred to as the full-domain input data approach, inputs the full load vector and outputs a full label vector. In this case, the classification process is carried out globally. The second approach consists of a window-based approach, where loads are preprocessed and partitioned into windows and the problem is formulated as a node-wise classification approach in which the central point of each window is treated individually. The classification problems are solved via deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks. The performance of these approaches is studied on one-dimensional numerical examples using F1-scores and accuracy metrics. In particular, it is shown that the windowing approach provides promising results, achieving an accuracy of 0.96 and an F1-score of 0.97. These results underscore the potential of the approach to automate coupling processes, leading to more accurate and computationally efficient solutions for material science applications.">

Novel phase space reconstruction techniques are needed to substantially reduce the number of measurements required to reconstruct detailed, high-dimensional beam features in order to resolve complex beam phenomena, and as feedback in precision beam shaping applications. In this study, we present a novel approach to reconstructing detailed 6-dimensional phase space distributions from experimental measurements using generative machine learning and differentiable beam dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that for a collection of synthetic beam distribution test cases that this approach can be used to resolve 6-dimensional phase space distributions using basic beam manipulations and as few as 20 2-dimensional measurements of the beam profile, without the need for prior data collection or model training. We also demonstrate an application of the reconstruction method in an experimental setting at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator, where it is able to reconstruct the beam distribution and accurately predict previously unseen measurements 75x faster than previous methods.">

        <tr id="High-quality passive devices are becoming increasingly important for the development of mobile devices and telecommunications, but obtaining such devices through simulation and analysis of electromagnetic (EM) behavior is time-consuming. To address this challenge, artificial neural network (ANN) models have emerged as an effective tool for modeling EM behavior, with NeuroTF being a representative example. However, these models are limited by the specific form of the transfer function, leading to discontinuity issues and high sensitivities. Moreover, previous methods have overlooked the physical relationship between distributed parameters, resulting in unacceptable numeric errors in the conversion results. To overcome these limitations, we propose two different neural network architectures: DeepOTF and ComplexTF. DeepOTF is a data-driven deep operator network for automatically learning feasible transfer functions for different geometric parameters. ComplexTF utilizes complex-valued neural networks to fit feasible transfer functions for different geometric parameters in the complex domain while maintaining causality and passivity. Our approach also employs an Equations-constraint Learning scheme to ensure the strict consistency of predictions and a dynamic weighting strategy to balance optimization objectives. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework shows superior performance than baseline methods, achieving up to 1700 × higher accuracy.">

        <tr id="Abstract A variety of enhanced sampling (ES) methods predict multidimensional free energy landscapes associated with biological and other molecular processes as a function of a few selected collective variables (CVs). The accuracy of these methods is crucially dependent on the ability of the chosen CVs to capture the relevant slow degrees of freedom of the system. For complex processes, finding such CVs is the real challenge. Machine learning (ML) CVs offer, in principle, a solution to handle this problem. However, these methods rely on the availability of high-quality datasets—ideally incorporating information about physical pathways and transition states—which are difficult to access, therefore greatly limiting their domain of application. Here, we demonstrate how these datasets can be generated by means of ES simulations in trajectory space via the metadynamics of paths algorithm. The approach is expected to provide a general and efficient way to generate efficient ML-based CVs for the fast prediction of free energy landscapes in ES simulations. We demonstrate our approach with two numerical examples, a 2D model potential and the isomerization of alanine dipeptide, using deep targeted discriminant analysis as our ML-based CV of choice.">

However, developing a unified model that describes the complex behavior of all nuclei remains an open challenge. Here, we explore whether novel symbolic Machine Learning (ML) can rediscover traditional nuclear physics models or identify alternatives with improved simplicity, fidelity, and predictive power. To address this challenge, we developed a Multi-objective Iterated Symbolic Regression approach that handles symbolic regressions over multiple target observables, accounts for experimental uncertainties and is robust against high-dimensional problems. As a proof of principle, we applied this method to describe the nuclear binding energies and charge radii of light and medium mass nuclei. Our approach identified simple analytical relationships based on the number of protons and neutrons, providing interpretable models with precision comparable to state-of-the-art nuclear models. Additionally, we integrated this ML-discovered model with an existing complementary model to estimate the limits of nuclear stability. These results highlight the potential of symbolic ML to develop accurate nuclear models and guide our description of complex many-body problems.">

        <tr id="Recurrent Neural Networks excel at predicting and generating complex high-dimensional temporal patterns. Due to their inherent nonlinear dynamics and memory, they can learn unbounded temporal dependencies from data. In a Machine Learning setting, the network's parameters are adapted during a training phase to match the requirements of a given task/problem increasing its computational capabilities. After the training, the network parameters are kept fixed to exploit the learned computations. The static parameters thereby render the network unadaptive to changing conditions, such as external or internal perturbation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how keeping parts of the network adaptive even after the training enhances its functionality and robustness. Here, we utilize the conceptor framework and conceptualize an adaptive control loop analyzing the network's behavior continuously and adjusting its time-varying internal representation to follow a desired target. We demonstrate how the added adaptivity of the network supports the computational functionality in three distinct tasks: interpolation of temporal patterns, stabilization against partial network degradation, and robustness against input distortion. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive networks in machine learning beyond training, enabling them to not only learn complex patterns but also dynamically adjust to changing environments, ultimately broadening their applicability.">

        <tr id="The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly evolving, and they are also commonly used in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, where functional safety is paramount. In AI-driven systems, uncertainty estimation allows the user to avoid overconfidence predictions and achieve functional safety. Therefore, the robustness and reliability of model predictions can be improved. However, conventional uncertainty estimation methods, such as the deep ensemble method, impose high computation and, accordingly, hardware (latency and energy) overhead because they require the storage and processing of multiple models. Alternatively, Monte Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) methods, although having low memory overhead, necessitate numerous ($\sim 100$) forward passes, leading to high computational overhead and latency. Thus, these approaches are not suitable for battery-powered edge devices with limited computing and memory resources. In this paper, we propose the Tiny-Deep Ensemble approach, a low-cost approach for uncertainty estimation on edge devices. In our approach, only normalization layers are ensembled $M$ times, with all ensemble members sharing common weights and biases, leading to a significant decrease in storage requirements and latency. Moreover, our approach requires only one forward pass in a hardware architecture that allows batch processing for inference and uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, it has approximately the same memory overhead compared to a single model. Therefore, latency and memory overhead are reduced by a factor of up to $\sim M\times$. Nevertheless, our method does not compromise accuracy, with an increase in inference accuracy of up to $\sim 1\%$ and a reduction in RMSE of $17.17\%$ in various benchmark datasets, tasks, and state-of-the-art architectures.">

However, accurately calibrating these models remains a challenge. Here, we present a novel application of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to address this issue. ABMs are based on parametrized stochastic rules that describe the time evolution of small components -- the so-called agents -- discretizing the system, leading to stochastic simulations that require appropriate treatment. Mathematically, the calibration defines a stochastic inverse problem. We propose to address it in a Bayesian setting using ABC. We facilitate the repeated comparison between data and simulations by quantifying the morphological information of single neurons with so-called morphometrics and resort to statistical distances to measure discrepancies between populations thereof. We conduct experiments on synthetic as well as experimental data. We find that ABC utilizing Sequential Monte Carlo sampling and the Wasserstein distance finds accurate posterior parameter distributions for representative ABMs. We further demonstrate that these ABMs capture specific features of pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (CA1). Overall, this work establishes a robust framework for calibrating agent-based neuronal growth models and opens the door for future investigations using Bayesian techniques for model building, verification, and adequacy assessment.">

As genomes in nature are bounded in size, this complexity is achieved by a growth process where cells communicate locally to decide whether to differentiate, proliferate and connect with other cells. This self-organisation is hypothesized to play an important part in the generalisation, and robustness of biological neural networks. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), on the other hand, are traditionally optimized in the space of weights. Thus, the benefits and challenges of growing artificial neural networks remain understudied. Building on the previously introduced Neural Developmental Programs (NDP), in this work we present an algorithm for growing ANNs that solve reinforcement learning tasks. We identify a key challenge: ensuring phenotypic complexity requires maintaining neuronal diversity, but this diversity comes at the cost of optimization stability. To address this, we introduce two mechanisms: (a) equipping neurons with an intrinsic state inherited upon neurogenesis; (b) lateral inhibition, a mechanism inspired by biological growth, which controlls the pace of growth, helping diversity persist. We show that both mechanisms contribute to neuronal diversity and that, equipped with them, NDPs achieve comparable results to existing direct and developmental encodings in complex locomotion tasks">

        <tr id="Deep learning (DL) plays a vital role in the design of electromagnetic (EM) structures. However, in current research, a single neural network typically supports only one structure design and requires a complex framework to accommodate multiple structure designs. This article proposes using one neural-assisted design for facilitating multiple EM structures. We use two filling methods to control the vector length, an identification method to ensure accurate prediction results, and a random auxiliary vectors method to increase the data volume and reduce loss. Subsequently, we design a forward neural network (FNN) and an inverse neural network (INN) using the proposed method. The developed neural network is used to complete the dual-passband frequency-selective surface (DP-FSS), space–time-coding digital metasurface element (STCDME), single-/dual-band absorbing metasurface (SDAM), and dual-stopband frequency-selective surface (DS-FSS) designs. The mean absolute error (MAE) loss values for FNN/INN predictions and actual results for these four structures are 0.019/0.116, 0.035/0.602, 5.14/0.146, and 0.018/0.07, respectively. Finally, we design four structures with the well-training network, fabricate DP-FSS and DS-FSS, and measure them in an anechoic chamber. The measurement and simulation results are in good agreement. The proposed method significantly reduces the complexity of multiple EM structure designs, decreases the need for multiple neural networks, and simplifies the design framework, thereby contributing to the development of AI-assisted EM structures.">

This innovative approach combines artificial neural networks (ANNs) integrating physical equations, which provide enhanced efficiency and accuracy when modeling various complex processes related to physics with a symmetric and asymmetric nature. The presented mathematical model, based on the system of Euler equations, has been carefully implemented using Python language.

The estimated results derived from this study are of paramount importance for ensuring ongoing energy supply reliability and can also be used to create predictive models related to gas behavior in pipelines. The application of modeling techniques for gas flow simulations has the potential to improve the integrity of our energy infrastructure and utilization of gas resources, contributing to advancing our understanding of symmetry principles in nature. However, it is crucial to emphasize that the effectiveness of such models relies on continuous monitoring and frequent updates to ensure alignment with real-world conditions. This research not only contributes to a deeper understanding of compressible gas flows but also underscores the crucial role of advanced modeling methodologies in the sustainable management of gas resources for both current and future generations. The numerical data covered the physics of the process related to the modeling of high-pressure gas flows in pipelines with regard to density, velocity and pressure, where the PINN model was able to outperform the classical CFD method for velocity by 170% and for pressure by 360%, based on L∞ values.">

        <tr id="This paper details how the Bayesian-network structure of the posterior distribution of state-space models can be exploited to build improved parameterizations for system identification using variational inference. Three different parameterizations of the assumed state-path posterior distribution are proposed based on this representation: time-varying, steady-state, and convolution-smoother; each resulting in a different parameter estimation method. In contrast to existing methods for variational system identification, the proposed estimators can be implemented with unconstrained optimization methods. Furthermore, when applied to mini-batches in conjunction with stochastic optimization methods, the convolution-smoother formulation enables identification of large linear and nonlinear state-space systems from very large datasets. For linear systems, the method achieves the same performance as the inherently sequential prediction-error methods using and embarrassingly parallel algorithm that benefits from large speedups when computed in modern graphical processing units (GPUs). The ability of the proposed estimators to identify large models, work with large datasets split into mini-batches, and be work in parallel on GPUs make them well-suited for identifying deep models for applications in systems and control.">

 Although phase separation is a ubiquitous phenomenon, the interactions between multiple components make it difficult to accurately model and predict. In recent years, machine learning has been widely used in physics simulations. Here, we present a physical information-enhanced graph neural network (PIENet) to simulate and predict the evolution of phase separation. The accuracy of our model in predicting particle positions is improved by 40.3% and 51.77% compared with CNN and SVM respectively. Moreover, we design an order parameter based on local density to measure the evolution of phase separation and analyze the systematic changes with different repulsion coefficients and different Schmidt numbers. The results demonstrate that our model can achieve long-term accurate predictions of order parameters without requiring complex handcrafted features. These results prove that graph neural networks can become new tools and methods for predicting the structure and properties of complex physical systems.">

In this sense, there is a need to find new ways to obtain data in a more economical manner. Thus, in this work we study the application of time series forecasting to fluid dynamics problems, where the aim is to predict the flow dynamics using only past information. We focus our study on models based on deep learning that do not require a high amount of data for training, as this is the problem we are trying to address. Specifically in this work we have tested three autoregressive models where two of them are fully based on deep learning and the other one is a hybrid model that combines modal decomposition with deep learning. We ask these models to generate $200$ time-ahead predictions of two datasets coming from a numerical simulation and experimental measurements, where the latter is characterized by being turbulent. We show how the hybrid model generates more reliable predictions in the experimental case, as it is physics-informed in the sense that the modal decomposition extracts the physics in a way that allows us to predict it.">

        <tr id="Mean-field games (MFGs) are developed to model the decision-making processes of a large number of interacting agents in multi-agent systems. This paper studies mean-field games on graphs (G-MFGs). The equilibria of G-MFGs, namely, mean-field equilibria (MFE), are challenging to solve for their high-dimensional action space because each agent has to make decisions when they are at junction nodes or on edges. Furthermore, when the initial population state varies on graphs, we have to recompute MFE, which could be computationally challenging and memory-demanding. To improve the scalability and avoid repeatedly solving G-MFGs every time their initial state changes, this paper proposes physics-informed graph neural operators (PIGNO). The PIGNO utilizes a graph neural operator to generate population dynamics, given initial population distributions. To better train the neural operator, it leverages physics knowledge to propagate population state transitions on graphs. A learning algorithm is developed, and its performance is evaluated on autonomous driving games on road networks. Our results demonstrate that the PIGNO is scalable and generalizable when tested under unseen initial conditions.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems often faces numerous data-related challenges. A fundamental requirement is the existence of a unique set of parameters for a chosen model structure, an issue commonly referred to as identifiability. Although this problem is well studied for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), few studies have focused on the more general class of systems described by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Examples of DAEs include dynamical systems with algebraic equations representing conservation laws or approximating fast dynamics. This work introduces a novel identifiability test for models characterized by nonlinear DAEs. Unlike previous approaches, our test only requires prior knowledge of the system equations and does not need nonlinear transformation, index reduction, or numerical integration of the DAEs. We employed our identifiability analysis across a diverse range of DAE models, illustrating how system identifiability depends on the choices of sensors, experimental conditions, and model structures. Given the added challenges involved in identifying DAEs when compared to ODEs, we anticipate that our findings will have broad applicability and contribute significantly to the development and validation of data-driven methods for DAEs and other structure-preserving models.">

We focus on 0+1 dimensional quantum field with kink/anti-kink configurations to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. The continuous-mixture autoregressive networks (CANs) enable the construction of accurate effective actions with tractable probability density estimation. Our numerical results demonstrate that this methodology not only facilitates the construction of effective actions at specified temperatures but also adeptly estimates the action at intermediate temperatures using data from both lower and higher temperature ensembles.

        <tr id="In this work, we explore the use of deep learning techniques to learn the relationships between nuclear cross-sections across the chart of isotopes. As a proof of principle, we focus on the neutron-induced reactions in the fast energy regime that are the most important in nuclear science and engineering. We use variational autoencoders (VAEs) and implicit neural representations (INRs) to build a learned feature representation space of nuclear cross sections and reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We then train graph neural networks (GNNs) on the resulting latent space to leverage the topological information encoded in the chart of isotopes and to capture the relationships between cross sections in different nuclei. We find that hypernetworks based on INRs significantly outperforms VAEs in encoding nuclear cross-sections. This superiority is attributed to INR's ability to model complex, varying frequency details, which enables lower prediction errors when combined with GNNs. We also observe that GNN optimization is much more successful when performed in the latent space, whether using INRs or VAEs. However VAEs' continuous representation also allows for direct GNN training in the original input space. We leverage these representational learning techniques and successfully predict cross sections for a 17x17 block of nuclei with high accuracy and precision. These findings suggest that both representation encoding of cross-sections and the prediction task hold significant potential in augmenting nuclear theory models, e.g., providing reliable estimates of covariances of cross sections, including cross-material covariances.">

        <tr id="Deep-Learning-based Variational Monte Carlo (DL-VMC) has recently emerged as a highly accurate approach for finding approximate solutions to the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation. Despite its favorable scaling with the number of electrons, $\mathcal{O}(n_\text{el}^{4})$, the practical value of DL-VMC is limited by the high cost of optimizing the neural network weights for every system studied. To mitigate this problem, recent research has proposed optimizing a single neural network across multiple systems, reducing the cost per system. Here we extend this approach to solids, where similar but distinct calculations using different geometries, boundary conditions, and supercell sizes are often required. We show how to optimize a single ansatz across all of these variations, reducing the required number of optimization steps by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we exploit the transfer capabilities of a pre-trained network. We successfully transfer a network, pre-trained on 2x2x2 supercells of LiH, to 3x3x3 supercells. This reduces the number of optimization steps required to simulate the large system by a factor of 50 compared to previous work.">

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for approximating the distribution of complex data. It is known that data passing through a trained DNN classifier undergoes a series of geometric and topological simplifications. While some progress has been made toward understanding these transformations in neural networks with smooth activation functions, an understanding in the more general setting of non-smooth activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which tend to perform better, is required. Here we propose that the geometric transformations performed by DNNs during classification tasks have parallels to those expected under Hamilton's Ricci flow - a tool from differential geometry that evolves a manifold by smoothing its curvature, in order to identify its topology. To illustrate this idea, we present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a DNN, and use this framework to motivate a notion of `global Ricci network flow' that can be used to assess a DNN's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems. By training more than $1,500$ DNN classifiers of different widths and depths on synthetic and real-world data, we show that the strength of global Ricci network flow-like behaviour correlates with accuracy for well-trained DNNs, independently of depth, width and data set. Our findings motivate the use of tools from differential and discrete geometry to the problem of explainability in deep learning.">

This approach provides a mathematically interpretable method that incorporates non-stationary covariance functions and heteroscedastic noise estimation to generate locally adapted models. The model performance is compared to different algorithms in benchmark tests for regression tasks. The results demonstrate low prediction errors of the PCEGP in these benchmark applications, highlighting model performance that is often competitive with or superior to previous methods.

        <tr id="A problem in nonlinear and complex dynamical systems with broad applications is forecasting the occurrence of a critical transition based solely on data without knowledge about the system equations. When such a transition leads to system collapse, as often is the case, all the available data are from the pre-critical regime where the system still functions normally, making the prediction problem challenging. In recent years, a machine-learning based approach tailored to solving this difficult prediction problem, adaptable reservoir computing, has been articulated. This Perspective introduces the basics of this machine-learning scheme and describes representative results. The general setting is that the system dynamics live on a normal attractor with oscillatory dynamics at the present time and, as a bifurcation parameter changes into the future, a critical transition can occur after which the system switches to a completely different attractor, signifying system collapse. To predict a critical transition, it is essential that the reservoir computer not only learns the dynamical "climate" of the system of interest at some specific parameter value but, more importantly, discovers how the system dynamics changes with the bifurcation parameter. It is demonstrated that this capability can be endowed into the machine through a training process with time series from a small number of distinct, pre-critical parameter values, thereby enabling accurate and reliable prediction of the catastrophic critical transition. Three applications are presented: predicting crisis, forecasting amplitude death, and creating digital twins of nonlinear dynamical systems. Limitations and future perspectives are discussed.">

Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with an exponent of approximately -0.5, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.">

In addition, CNT metrics have been applied to a limited range of architectures, mainly including Fully Connected neural networks. In this work, we extend the existing CNT metrics with measures that sample from the DNNs' training distribution, shifting from a purely topological analysis to one that connects with the interpretability of deep learning. For the novel metrics, in addition to the existing ones, we provide a mathematical formalisation for Fully Connected, AutoEncoder, Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks, of which we vary the activation functions and the number of hidden layers. We show that these metrics differentiate DNNs based on the architecture, the number of hidden layers, and the activation function. Our contribution provides a method rooted in physics for interpreting DNNs that offers insights beyond the traditional input-output relationship and the CNT topological analysis.">

Due to their complex, high-dimensional nature, jets can be explored holistically by neural networks in ways that are not possible manually. However, innovations in all areas of jet physics are proceeding in parallel. We show that specially constructed machine learning models trained for a specific jet classification task can improve the accuracy, precision, or speed of all other jet physics tasks. This is demonstrated by training on a particular multiclass classification task and then using the learned representation for different classification tasks, for datasets with a different (full) detector simulation, for jets from a different collision system ($pp$ versus $ep$), for generative models, for likelihood ratio estimation, and for anomaly detection. Our OmniLearn approach is thus a foundation model and is made publicly available for use in any area where state-of-the-art precision is required for analyses involving jets and their substructure.">

By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.">

Data assimilation is crucial for achieving this goal because it provides a systematic framework to calibrate model outputs with observations, which can include remote sensing imagery and ground station measurements, with uncertainty quantification. Conventional methods, including Kalman filters and variational approaches, inherently rely on simplifying linear and Gaussian assumptions, and can be computationally expensive. Nevertheless, with the rapid adoption of data-driven methods in many areas of computational sciences, we see the potential of emulating traditional data assimilation with deep learning, especially generative models. In particular, the diffusion-based probabilistic framework has large overlaps with data assimilation principles: both allows for conditional generation of samples with a Bayesian inverse framework. These models have shown remarkable success in text-conditioned image generation or image-controlled video synthesis. Likewise, one can frame data assimilation as observation-conditioned state calibration. In this work, we propose SLAMS: Score-based Latent Assimilation in Multimodal Setting. Specifically, we assimilate in-situ weather station data and ex-situ satellite imagery to calibrate the vertical temperature profiles, globally. Through extensive ablation, we demonstrate that SLAMS is robust even in low-resolution, noisy, and sparse data settings. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep generative framework for multimodal data assimilation using real-world datasets; an important step for building robust computational simulators, including the next-generation Earth system models.

Therefore, estimation of tight bounds on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks is a well-studied topic.

In this letter, we provide a compositional approach to estimate Lipschitz constants for deep feedforward neural networks by obtaining an exact decomposition of the large matrix verification problem into smaller sub-problems. We further obtain a closed-form solution that applies to most common neural network activation functions, which will enable rapid robustness and stability certificates for neural networks deployed in online control settings.

This study specifically addresses the challenge of filling missing data for the interior temperatures inside a passive house by utilizing artificial neural networks (ANN). So, to achieve this aim, various monitored predictors, including outdoor temperature (Tout), outdoor humidity (RHout), atmospheric pressure (Press mm Hg), wind speed, dew point temperature (Tdewpoint), visibility, and energy consumption within the house, are employed to construct our developed models. Indeed, our primary goal is to complete the mean temperature (Tmean) of the passive house, enhancing its utility as an additional predictive variable for supplementing internal temperatures in individual rooms (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T7, T8, and T9). Significantly, our study provides evidence of the enhanced performance of the proposed approach through evaluation metrics. Specifically, during the training phase, the root mean square error (RMSE) is reported as 0.12, with a remarkably high coefficient of determination (R2) at 0.99. Similarly, for the testing phase, the achieved values are RMSE=0.25 and R2=0.98 in the prediction of Tmean. Ultimately, these metrics underscore the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in addressing missing data and enhancing the predictive capabilities of the passive house temperature model.">

We use quantics TCI (QTCI) in this method and demonstrate its effectiveness on sine and two-time correlation functions, with each evaluated with random noise. The resulting TT exhibits increased robustness against noise compared to the QTCI method. Furthermore, we employ this optimized TT of the correlation function in quantum simulation based on pseudo-imaginary-time evolution, resulting in ground-state energy with higher accuracy than the QTCI or Monte Carlo methods.">

Despite their efficacy, a significant drawback of GNNs lies in their limited ability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, posing challenges to their reliability in contexts where errors carry significant consequences. Moreover, GNNs typically excel in in-distribution settings, assuming that training and test data follow identical distributions: a condition often unmet in real-world graph data scenarios. In this article, we leverage conformal prediction, a widely recognized statistical technique for quantifying uncertainty by transforming predictive model outputs into prediction sets, to address uncertainty quantification in GNN predictions amidst conditional shift \footnote{Representing the change in conditional probability distribution $P(label |input)$ from source domain to target domain.} in graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL).

Within quantum mechanical first principles approaches, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is the preeminent tool for understanding electronic structure, and the high-dimensional wavefunctions calculated in this approach serve as the building block for downstream calculations of correlated many-body excitations and related physical observables. Here, we use variational autoencoders (VAE) for the unsupervised learning of high-dimensional DFT wavefunctions and show that these wavefunctions lie in a low-dimensional manifold within the latent space. Our model autonomously determines the optimal representation of the electronic structure, avoiding limitations due to manual feature engineering and selection in prior work. To demonstrate the utility of the latent space representation of the DFT wavefunction, we use it for the supervised training of neural networks (NN) for downstream prediction of the quasiparticle bandstructures within the GW formalism, which includes many-electron correlations beyond DFT. The GW prediction achieves a low error of 0.11 eV for a combined test set of metals and semiconductors drawn from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), suggesting that latent space representation captures key physical information from the original data. Finally, we explore the interpretability of the VAE representation and show that the successful representation learning and downstream prediction by our model is derived from the smoothness of the VAE latent space, which also enables the generation of wavefunctions on arbitrary points in latent space.

Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

It exhibits robustness against outliers, insensitivity to noise, boundedness, and a crucial smoothness property. Theoretically, we establish that the proposed wave loss function manifests the essential characteristic of being classification-calibrated. Leveraging this breakthrough, we incorporate the proposed wave loss function into the least squares setting of support vector machines (SVM) and twin support vector machines (TSVM), resulting in two robust and smooth models termed Wave-SVM and Wave-TSVM, respectively. To address the optimization problem inherent in Wave-SVM, we utilize the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm. It is noteworthy that this paper marks the first instance of the Adam algorithm application to solve an SVM model. Further, we devise an iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problems of Wave-TSVM. To empirically showcase the effectiveness of the proposed Wave-SVM and Wave-TSVM, we evaluate them on benchmark UCI and KEEL datasets (with and without feature noise) from diverse domains. Moreover, to exemplify the applicability of Wave-SVM in the biomedical domain, we evaluate it on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.

Recent advances in machine learning have shown that"imperfect"feedback of errors during training can yield test performance that is similar to using full backpropagated errors, provided that the two error signals are at least somewhat aligned. Inspired by such methods, we introduce an iterative, spatiotemporally local protocol to learn driving forces and control non-equilibrium dynamical systems using imperfect feedback signals. We present numerical experiments and theoretical justification for several examples. For systems in conservative force fields that are driven by external time-dependent protocols, our update rules resemble a dynamical version of contrastive divergence. We appeal to linear response theory to establish that our imperfect update rules are locally convergent for these conservative systems. For systems evolving under non-conservative dynamics, we derive a new theoretical result that makes possible the control of non-equilibrium steady-state probabilities through simple local update rules. Finally, we show that similar local update rules can also solve dynamical control problems for non-conservative systems, and we illustrate this in the non-trivial example of active nematics. Our updates allow learning spatiotemporal activity fields that pull topological defects along desired trajectories in the active nematic fluid. These imperfect feedback methods are information efficient and in principle biologically plausible, and they can help extend recent methods of decentralized training for physical materials into dynamical settings.">

        <tr id="The intersection between classical data assimilation methods and novel machine learning techniques has attracted significant interest in recent years. Here we explore another promising solution in which diffusion models are used to formulate a robust nonlinear ensemble filter for sequential data assimilation. Unlike standard machine learning methods, the proposed \textit{Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF)} is completely training-free and can efficiently generate a set of analysis ensemble members. In this study, we apply the EnSF to a surface quasi-geostrophic model and compare its performance against the popular Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF), which makes Gaussian assumptions on the posterior distribution. Numerical tests demonstrate that EnSF maintains stable performance in the absence of localization and for a variety of experimental settings. We find that EnSF achieves competitive performance relative to LETKF in the case of linear observations, but leads to significant advantages when the state is nonlinearly observed and the numerical model is subject to unexpected shocks. A spectral decomposition of the analysis results shows that the largest improvements over LETKF occur at large scales (small wavenumbers) where LETKF lacks sufficient ensemble spread. Overall, this initial application of EnSF to a geophysical model of intermediate complexity is very encouraging, and motivates further developments of the algorithm for more realistic problems.">

Compared to single metal nanostructures, yolk shells have more controllable degrees of freedom, which may make experiments and simulations more complex. Using neural networks can efficiently simplify the computational process of yolk shell.

The absorption efficiency of the yolk shell was comprehensively described through the forward and reverse prediction processes. In forward prediction, the absorption spectrum of yolk shell is obtained through its size parameter. In reverse prediction, the size parameters of yolk shells are predicted through absorption spectra.

        <tr id="Explaining deep learning models operating on time series data is crucial in various applications of interest which require interpretable and transparent insights from time series signals. In this work, we investigate this problem from an information theoretic perspective and show that most existing measures of explainability may suffer from trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet practical objective function for time series explainable learning. The design of the objective function builds upon the principle of information bottleneck (IB), and modifies the IB objective function to avoid trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. We further present TimeX++, a novel explanation framework that leverages a parametric network to produce explanation-embedded instances that are both in-distributed and label-preserving. We evaluate TimeX++ on both synthetic and real-world datasets comparing its performance against leading baselines, and validate its practical efficacy through case studies in a real-world environmental application. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that TimeX++ outperforms baselines across all datasets, demonstrating a substantial improvement in explanation quality for time series data.

Furthermore, numerical experiments were performed to complete missing values. Based on the results, we evaluated the practical applications of the time-series quantum generation model.

        <tr id="In the field of vehicle aerodynamic simulation, Reynold Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model is widely used due to its high efficiency. However, it has some limitations in capturing complex flow features and simulating large separated flows. In order to improve the computational accuracy within a suitable cost, the Field Inversion and Machine Learning (FIML) method, based on a data-driven approach, has received increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, the optimal coefficients of the Generalized k-ω (GEKO) model are firstly obtained by the discrete adjoint method of FIML, utilizing the results of wind tunnel experiments. Then, the mapping relationship between the flow field characteristics and the optimal coefficients is established by a neural network to augment the turbulence model. On the basis of that, the study further investigates the effects of hyperparameters such as epoch, batch size, activation function, and learning rate on the accuracy of the augmented GEKO model. The result shows that with the drag coefficient (CD) as the target, batch size and activation function significantly influence the accuracy of the trained model. When a batch size of 512 and either Softsign or Leaky-ReLU activation function are employed, the trained model predicts CD value closest to the experimental values in the condition of 2000 epochs and a learning rate of 0.001. Increasing the batch size to 1024 or the learning rate to 0.002 provides some improvement in model accuracy, but the effect is not obvious. This work is an important reference for the debugging and improvement of FIML method.">

However, the involved high computational costs and uncertainties in these existing schemes are requiring potential improvements through alternative machine learning methods. Previous works use a unified model to learn the dynamics and physics of the atmospheric model. Contrarily, we propose a simple yet effective machine learning model that learns the horizontal movement in the dynamical core and vertical movement in the physical parameterization separately. By replacing the advection with a graph attention network and the convection with a multi-layer perceptron, our model provides a new and efficient perspective to simulate the transition of variables in atmospheric models. We also assess the model's performance over a 5-day iterative forecasting. Under the same input variables and training methods, our model outperforms existing data-driven methods with a significantly-reduced number of parameters with a resolution of 5.625 deg. Overall, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts that leverage machine learning techniques for improving both the accuracy and efficiency of global weather forecasting.">

In recent years, numerous advances in model architectures as well as the development of hybrid models combining machine-learning (ML) with more traditional, physically-motivated, force-field interactions have considerably increased the design space of ML potentials. In this paper, we present FeNNol, a new library for building, training and running force-field-enhanced neural network potentials. It provides a flexible and modular system for building hybrid models, allowing to easily combine state-of-the-art embeddings with ML-parameterized physical interaction terms without the need for explicit programming. Furthermore, FeNNol leverages the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation features of the Jax Python library to enable fast evaluation of NNPs, shrinking the performance gap between ML potentials and standard force-fields. This is demonstrated with the popular ANI-2x model reaching simulation speeds nearly on par with the AMOEBA polarizable force-field on commodity GPUs (GPU=Graphics processing unit). We hope that FeNNol will facilitate the development and application of new hybrid NNP architectures for a wide range of molecular simulation problems.">

Under this modeling assumption, the latent variables represent the underlying manifold or essential features present in the neural data. When GPs are trained, the latent variable can be inferred from neural data to decode the labels with a high accuracy.

        <tr id="Recent works show that overparameterized neural networks contain small subnetworks that exhibit comparable accuracy to the full model when trained in isolation. These results highlight the potential to reduce the computational costs of deep neural network training without sacrificing generalization performance. Initial approaches for finding these small networks relied on expensive multi-round train-and-prune procedures, limiting their practical potential, but more recent work identifies subnetworks using structured pruning techniques early in training. In this article, we study network activations, rather than network weights, and find that hidden layer activations in overparameterized networks exist primarily in subspaces smaller than the actual model width. We further notice that these subspaces can be identified early in training. Based on these observations, we show how to efficiently find small networks that exhibit similar accuracy to their overparameterized counterparts after only a few training epochs. We term these network architectures Principal Component Networks (PCNs). PCNs compress individual layers by retaining only the high variance linear combinations of channels—defined by the principal components of the layer inputs—a key difference from structured pruning techniques which focus on individual channel pruning using localized channel measurements. We evaluate PCNs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet for VGG and ResNet style architectures and compare against existing methods for subnetwork identification during early training. We find that PCNs consistently reduce parameter counts with little accuracy loss, thus providing the potential to reduce the computational costs of deep neural network training. Beyond model compression, we also connect our observation regarding hidden layer activations to the feature representations learned by neural networks and discuss areas for future work.">

We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the Gaussian Process in which the data plays the role of the energy scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes.

To overcome this challenge, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have emerged as an increasingly popular solution, due to their high performance and low power consumption. Further, their ability to undergo dynamic and partial reconfiguration enables the extremely rapid evaluation of the fitness of CTRNNs, effectively addressing the bottleneck associated with conventional methods of evolvable hardware. By incorporating fitness evaluation directly upon the programmable logic of the FPGA, hyper-parallel evaluation becomes feasible, dramatically reducing the time required for assessment. This inherent parallelism of FPGAs accelerates the entire neuroevolutionary process by several orders of magnitude, facilitating faster convergence to an optimal solution. The work presented in this study demonstrates the potential of utilizing dynamic and partial reconfiguration on capable FPGAs as a powerful platform for neuroevolving dynamic neural networks.">

        <tr id="Popular artificial neural networks (ANN) optimize parameters for unidirectional value propagation, assuming some guessed parametrization type like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). In contrast, for biological neurons e.g."it is not uncommon for axonal propagation of action potentials to happen in both directions"\cite{axon} - suggesting they are optimized to continuously operate in multidirectional way. Additionally, statistical dependencies a single neuron could model is not just (expected) value dependence, but entire joint distributions including also higher moments. Such agnostic joint distribution neuron would allow for multidirectional propagation (of distributions or values) e.g. $\rho(x|y,z)$ or $\rho(y,z|x)$ by substituting to $\rho(x,y,z)$ and normalizing. There will be discussed Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction (HCR) for such neuron model: assuming $\rho(x,y,z)=\sum_{ijk} a_{ijk} f_i(x) f_j(y) f_k(z)$ type parametrization of joint distribution with polynomial basis $f_i$, which allows for flexible, inexpensive processing including nonlinearities, direct model estimation and update, trained through standard backpropagation or novel ways for such structure up to tensor decomposition. Using only pairwise (input-output) dependencies, its expected value prediction becomes KAN-like with trained activation functions as polynomials, can be extended by adding higher order dependencies through included products - in conscious interpretable way, allowing for multidirectional propagation of both values and probability densities.">

 By using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method, we construct a large dataset with about one million spectral functions of the Anderson quantum impurity model. The dataset contains the density of states (DOS) of the host material, the strength of Coulomb interaction between on-site electrons ($U$), and the hybridization between the host material and the impurity site ($\Gamma$). The continue DOS and spectral functions are stored with Chebyshev coefficients and wavelet functions, respectively. From this dateset, we build seven different machine learning networks to predict the spectral function from the input data, DOS, $U$, and $\Gamma$. Three different evaluation indexes, mean absolute error (MAE), relative error (RE) and root mean square error (RMSE), are used to analyze the prediction abilities of different network models. Detailed analysis show that, for the two kinds of widely used recurrent neural networks (RNNs), gate recurrent unit (GRU) has the better performance than the long short term memory (LSTM) network. A combination of bidiretional GRU (BiGRU) and GRU has the best performance among GRU, BiGRU, LSTM, BiLSTM. The MAE peak of BiGRU+GRU reaches 0.00037. We have also test a One-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) with 20 hidden layers and a residual neural network (ResNet), we find that the 1DCNN has almost the same performance of the BiGRU+GRU network for the original dataset, while the robustness testing seems to be a little weak than BiGRU+GRU when we test all these models on two other independent dataset. The ResNet has the worst performance among all the seven network models.The datasets presented in this paper, including the Large data set of spectral function of Anderson quantum impurity model, are openly available at https://www.doi.org/[10.57760/sciencedb.j00113.00192] (https://www.scidb.cn/en/s/BzYBVr )">

However, achieving promising GNN performance, especially on unseen data, requires comprehensive hyperparameter tuning and meticulous training.

Additionally, conventional searching algorithms such as grid search may result in overfitting on validation data, diminishing generalization accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we propose a graph conditional latent diffusion framework (GNN-Diff) to generate high-performing GNNs directly by learning from checkpoints saved during a light-tuning coarse search. Our method: (1) unleashes GNN training from heavy tuning and complex search space design; (2) produces GNN parameters that outperform those obtained through comprehensive grid search; and (3) establishes higher-quality generation for GNNs compared to diffusion frameworks designed for general neural networks.">

We introduce a repeated learning process to jointly describe several phenomena attributed to unintended hidden feedback loops, such as error amplification, induced concept drift, echo chambers and others. The process comprises the entire cycle of obtaining the data, training the predictive model, and delivering predictions to end-users within a single mathematical model. A distinctive feature of such repeated learning setting is that the state of the environment becomes causally dependent on the learner itself over time, thus violating the usual assumptions about the data distribution. We present a novel dynamical systems model of the repeated learning process and prove the limiting set of probability distributions for positive and negative feedback loop modes of the system operation. We conduct a series of computational experiments using an exemplary supervised learning problem on two synthetic data sets. The results of the experiments correspond to the theoretical predictions derived from the dynamical model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for studying the repeated learning processes in machine learning systems and open a range of opportunities for further research in the area.">

In this work, we develop a thermodynamically consistent EOS model that utilizes a physics-informed machine learning approach to implicitly learn the underlying Helmholtz free-energy from AIMD generated energies and pressures. The model, referred to as PIML-EOS, was trained and tested on warm dense polystyrene producing a fit within a 1% relative error for both energy and pressure and is shown to satisfy both the Maxwell and Gibbs–Duhem relations. In addition, we provide a path toward obtaining thermodynamic quantities, such as the total entropy and chemical potential (containing both ionic and electronic contributions), which are not available from current AIMD simulations.">

Distinguished from other structure-function methodologies, NCT's predictive capabilities can be coupled with deploying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have demonstrated exceptional utility in various network-based learning tasks. However, the performance of GNNs heavily relies on the expressiveness of node features, and the lack of node features can greatly degrade their performance. Furthermore, many real-world systems may lack node-level information, posing a challenge for GNNs.To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, NCT-based Enhanced Feature Augmentation (NCT-EFA), that assimilates average controllability, along with other centrality indices, into the feature augmentation pipeline to enhance GNNs performance. Our evaluation of NCT-EFA, on six benchmark GNN models across two experimental setting. solely employing average controllability and in combination with additional centrality metrics. showcases an improved performance reaching as high as 11%.

        <tr id="We present an algorithm for constructing efficient surrogate frequency‐domain models of (nonlinear) parametric dynamical systems in a non‐intrusive way. To capture the dependence of the underlying system on frequency and parameters, our proposed approach combines rational approximation and smooth interpolation. In the approximation effort, locally adaptive sparse grids are applied to effectively explore the parameter domain even if the number of parameters is modest or high. Adaptivity is also employed to build rational approximations that efficiently capture the frequency dependence of the problem. These two features enable our method to build surrogate models that achieve a user‐prescribed approximation accuracy, without wasting resources in “oversampling” the frequency and parameter domains. Thanks to its non‐intrusiveness, our proposed method, as opposed to projection‐based techniques for model order reduction, can be applied regardless of the complexity of the underlying physical model. Notably, our algorithm for adaptive sampling can be used even when prior knowledge of the problem structure is not available. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it in the study of an aerodynamic bearing. Our method allows us to build surrogate models that adequately identify the bearing's behavior with respect to both design and operational parameters, while still achieving significant speedups.">

        <tr id="Electrical engineering models often rely on complex circuit configurations that facilitate the dynamic flow of electrically charged particles within a closed conductive network. These circuits serve as essential tools for simulating and analyzing diverse electrical systems and components. This paper introduces a study on nonlinear fractional circuits modeling through the development of a stochastic neuro-computational artificial intelligent-based solver to address mathematical models governing the Fractional order Caputo–Fabrizio stiff electric circuit model (FO-CFSECM) by manipulating the knacks of layered recurrent neural networks (LRNNs) trained with Gradient-based local search algorithm (GLA). In fractional calculus, the Caputo–Fabrizio (CF) fractional order derivative (FOD) emerges as a powerful instrument, binding its capabilities to deliver remarkably accurate solutions for fractional stiff systems. The objective of this work is to exploit the numerical treatment comprehensively for the dynamics of fractal Resistor–Capacitor (RC) and fractal Resistor–Inductor (RL) circuit models by introducing the CF fractional operator. Through the application of artificial intelligence-based soft computing and advanced back-propagative deep neural networks, a deeper understanding of the behavior and distinctive characteristics inherent in these models is sought. The Levenberg–Marquardt optimizer serves as an efficient training GLA tool for learning of LRNNs weights of fractal RL/RC circuit models. The comparative studies on variants of FO-CFSECM demonstrate that LRNNs achieve an impressive mean square error (MSE) ranging from 10[Formula: see text] to 10[Formula: see text] and absolute error (AE) within 10[Formula: see text] to 10[Formula: see text]. The accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of LRNNs for solving the FO-CFSECM were further validated through MSE, AE, controlling parameters of state transitions, error histograms, and correlation measures.">

Owing to its differentiable nature, BFNs are promising in modeling both continuous and discrete data, while simultaneously maintaining fast sampling capabilities. This paper aims to understand and enhance BFNs by connecting them with DMs through stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We identify the linear SDEs corresponding to the noise-addition processes in BFNs, demonstrate that BFN's regression losses are aligned with denoise score matching, and validate the sampler in BFN as a first-order solver for the respective reverse-time SDE. Based on these findings and existing recipes of fast sampling in DMs, we propose specialized solvers for BFNs that markedly surpass the original BFN sampler in terms of sample quality with a limited number of function evaluations (e.g., 10) on both image and text datasets. Notably, our best sampler achieves an increase in speed of 5~20 times for free. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/BFN-Solver.">

        <tr id="The complexity of black-box algorithms can lead to various challenges, including the introduction of biases. These biases present immediate risks in the algorithms' application. It was, for instance, shown that neural networks can deduce racial information solely from a patient's X-ray scan, a task beyond the capability of medical experts. If this fact is not known to the medical expert, automatic decision-making based on this algorithm could lead to prescribing a treatment (purely) based on racial information. While current methodologies allow for the"orthogonalization"or"normalization"of neural networks with respect to such information, existing approaches are grounded in linear models. Our paper advances the discourse by introducing corrections for non-linearities such as ReLU activations. Our approach also encompasses scalar and tensor-valued predictions, facilitating its integration into neural network architectures. Through extensive experiments, we validate our method's effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data in generalized linear models, normalizing convolutional neural networks for metadata, and rectifying pre-existing embeddings for undesired attributes.">

        <tr id="In the domain of differential equation-based generative modeling, conventional approaches often rely on single-dimensional scalar values as interpolation coefficients during both training and inference phases. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, a multidimensional interpolant that extends these coefficients into multiple dimensions, leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework. Additionally, we propose a novel path optimization problem tailored to adaptively determine multidimensional inference trajectories, with a predetermined differential equation solver and a fixed number of function evaluations. Our solution involves simulation dynamics coupled with adversarial training to optimize the inference path. Notably, employing a multidimensional interpolant during training improves the model's inference performance, even in the absence of path optimization. When the adaptive, multidimensional path derived from our optimization process is employed, it yields further performance gains, even with fixed solver configurations. The introduction of multidimensional interpolants not only enhances the efficacy of models but also opens up a new domain for exploration in training and inference methodologies, emphasizing the potential of multidimensional paths as an untapped frontier.">

        <tr id="Data-driven, machine learning (ML) models of atomistic interactions are often based on flexible and non-physical functions that can relate nuanced aspects of atomic arrangements into predictions of energies and forces. As a result, these potentials are as good as the training data (usually results of so-called ab initio simulations) and we need to make sure that we have enough information for a model to become sufficiently accurate, reliable and transferable. The main challenge stems from the fact that descriptors of chemical environments are often sparse high-dimensional objects without a well-defined continuous metric. Therefore, it is rather unlikely that any ad hoc method of choosing training examples will be indiscriminate, and it will be easy to fall into the trap of confirmation bias, where the same narrow and biased sampling is used to generate train- and test- sets. We will demonstrate that classical concepts of statistical planning of experiments and optimal design can help to mitigate such problems at a relatively low computational cost. The key feature of the method we will investigate is that they allow us to assess the informativeness of data (how much we can improve the model by adding/swapping a training example) and verify if the training is feasible with the current set before obtaining any reference energies and forces -- a so-called off-line approach. In other words, we are focusing on an approach that is easy to implement and doesn't require sophisticated frameworks that involve automated access to high-performance computational (HPC).">

        <tr id="Autonomous tuning of particle accelerators is an active and challenging field of research with the goal of enabling novel accelerator technologies cutting-edge high-impact applications, such as physics discovery, cancer research and material sciences. A key challenge with autonomous accelerator tuning remains that the most capable algorithms require an expert in optimisation, machine learning or a similar field to implement the algorithm for every new tuning task. In this work, we propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to tune particle accelerators. We demonstrate on a proof-of-principle example the ability of LLMs to successfully and autonomously tune a particle accelerator subsystem based on nothing more than a natural language prompt from the operator, and compare the performance of our LLM-based solution to state-of-the-art optimisation algorithms, such as Bayesian optimisation (BO) and reinforcement learning-trained optimisation (RLO). In doing so, we also show how LLMs can perform numerical optimisation of a highly non-linear real-world objective function. Ultimately, this work represents yet another complex task that LLMs are capable of solving and promises to help accelerate the deployment of autonomous tuning algorithms to the day-to-day operations of particle accelerators.">
