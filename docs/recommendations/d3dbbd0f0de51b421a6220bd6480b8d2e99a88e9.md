        <tr id="Time-series and graphs have been extensively studied for their ubiquitous existence in numerous domains. Both topics have been separately explored in the field of deep learning. For time-series modeling, recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks model the relations between values across timesteps, while for graph modeling, graph neural networks model the inter-relations between nodes. Recent research in deep learning requires simultaneous modeling for time-series and graphs when both representations are present. For example, both types of modeling are necessary for time-series classification, regression, and anomaly detection in graphs. This article aims to provide a comprehensive summary of these models, which we call graph time-series models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey article that provides a picture of related models from the perspective of deep graph time-series modeling to address a range of time-series tasks, including regression, classification, and anomaly detection. Graph time-series models are split into two categories: (a) graph recurrent/convolutional neural networks and (b) graph attention neural networks. Under each category, we further categorize models based on their properties. Additionally, we compare representative models and discuss how distinctive model characteristics are utilized with respect to various model components and data challenges. Pointers to commonly used datasets and code are included to facilitate access for further research. In the end, we discuss potential directions for future research.">

        <tr id="With the recent advances in technology, a wide range of systems continue to collect a large amount of data over time and thus generate time series. Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) is an important task in various time-series applications such as e-commerce, cybersecurity, vehicle maintenance, and healthcare monitoring. However, this task is very challenging as it requires considering both the intra-variable dependency (relationships within a variable over time) and the inter-variable dependency (relationships between multiple variables) existing in time-series data. Recent graph-based approaches have made impressive progress in tackling the challenges of this field. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive and up-to-date review of TSAD using graphs, referred to as G-TSAD. First, we explore the significant potential of graph representation for time-series data and and its contributions to facilitating anomaly detection. Then, we review state-of-the-art graph anomaly detection techniques, mostly leveraging deep learning architectures, in the context of time series. For each method, we discuss its strengths, limitations, and the specific applications where it excels. Finally, we address both the technical and application challenges currently facing the field, and suggest potential future directions for advancing research and improving practical outcomes.">

        <tr id="In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.">

        <tr id="Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in multivariable time series anomaly detection, particularly by explicitly modeling inter-variable relationships. However, to prevent the distinct pattern of one variable from introducing noise to unrelated variables, existing methods focus solely on leveraging positive correlations among neighbors for relationship modeling while neglecting the role of negative correlations. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in complex scenarios where both positive and negative dependencies are critical. To address this challenge, we propose PNGDN, a novel GNN framework that incorporates both positive and negative correlations to enhance anomaly-detection performance. Notably, PNGDN introduces a correlational graph structure learning module that simultaneously captures positive and negative dependencies. It quantitatively filters out spurious relationships based on the value of similarity, which serves as a unified threshold to screen both positive and negative correlations, allowing the model to focus on truly meaningful correlations among variables. Additionally, an attention-based information propagation mechanism ensures the efficient propagation of information under positive and negative correlations, facilitating accurate predictions for each variable. Extensive experiments on three benchmark time series anomaly detection datasets validate the superior performance of PNGDN.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting lies at the core of important real-world applications in many fields of science and engineering. The abundance of large time series datasets that consist of complex patterns and long-term dependencies has led to the development of various neural network architectures. Graph neural network approaches, which jointly learn a graph structure based on the correlation of raw values of multivariate time series while forecasting, have recently seen great success. However, such solutions are often costly to train and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose TimeGNN, a method that learns dynamic temporal graph representations that can capture the evolution of inter-series patterns along with the correlations of multiple series. TimeGNN achieves inference times 4 to 80 times faster than other state-of-the-art graph-based methods while achieving comparable forecasting performance">

        <tr id="Graph deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Unlike traditional multivariate forecasting methods, graph-based predictors leverage pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on graphs spanning the time series collection. The conditioning takes the form of architectural inductive biases on the forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. These biases allow for training global forecasting models on large collections of time series while localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (nodes) by accounting for correlations among them (edges). Recent advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing framework appealing and timely. However, most studies focus on refining existing architectures by exploiting modern deep-learning practices. Conversely, foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill this void, this tutorial paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework formalizing the forecasting problem and providing design principles for graph-based predictors, as well as methods to assess their performance. In addition, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future directions.">

        <tr id="Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) enables the analysis if complex temporal data, and thus serves as a cornerstone in various real-world applications, ranging from healthcare to finance. Since the relationship among variables in MTS usually contain crucial cues, a large number of graph-based MTSC approaches have been proposed, as the graph topology and edges can explicitly represent relationships among variables (channels), where not only various MTS graph representation learning strategies but also different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been explored. Despite such progresses, there is no comprehensive study that fairly benchmarks and investigates the performances of existing widely-used graph representation learning strategies/GNN classifiers in the application of different MTSC tasks. In this paper, we present the first benchmark which systematically investigates the effectiveness of the widely-used three node feature definition strategies, four edge feature learning strategies and five GNN architecture, resulting in 60 different variants for graph-based MTSC. These variants are developed and evaluated with a standardized data pipeline and training/validation/testing strategy on 26 widely-used suspensor MTSC datasets. Our experiments highlight that node features significantly influence MTSC performance, while the visualization of edge features illustrates why adaptive edge learning outperforms other edge feature learning methods. The code of the proposed benchmark is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CVI-yangwn/Benchmark-GNN-for-Multivariate-Time-Series-Classification}.">

        <tr id="Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series is essential in industrial applications, as it significantly reduces the need for manual intervention. Multivariate time series pose a complex challenge due to their feature and temporal dimensions. Traditional methods use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Transformers to analyze spatial while RNNs to model temporal dependencies. These methods focus narrowly on one dimension or engage in coarse-grained feature extraction, which can be inadequate for large datasets characterized by intricate relationships and dynamic changes. This paper introduces a novel temporal model built on an enhanced Graph Attention Network (GAT) for multivariate time series anomaly detection called TopoGDN. Our model analyzes both time and feature dimensions from a fine-grained perspective. First, we introduce a multi-scale temporal convolution module to extract detailed temporal features. Additionally, we present an augmented GAT to manage complex inter-feature dependencies, which incorporates graph topology into node features across multiple scales, a versatile, plug-and-play enhancement that significantly boosts the performance of GAT. Our experimental results confirm that our approach surpasses the baseline models on four datasets, demonstrating its potential for widespread application in fields requiring robust anomaly detection.

        <tr id="Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has shown great importance in numerous industries. Current state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN)-based forecasting methods usually require both graph networks (e.g., GCN) and temporal networks (e.g., LSTM) to capture inter-series (spatial) dynamics and intra-series (temporal) dependencies, respectively. However, the uncertain compatibility of the two networks puts an extra burden on handcrafted model designs. Moreover, the separate spatial and temporal modeling naturally violates the unified spatiotemporal inter-dependencies in real world, which largely hinders the forecasting performance. To overcome these problems, we explore an interesting direction of directly applying graph networks and rethink MTS forecasting from a pure graph perspective. We first define a novel data structure, hypervariate graph, which regards each series value (regardless of variates or timestamps) as a graph node, and represents sliding windows as space-time fully-connected graphs. This perspective considers spatiotemporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates classic MTS forecasting into the predictions on hypervariate graphs. Then, we propose a novel architecture Fourier Graph Neural Network (FourierGNN) by stacking our proposed Fourier Graph Operator (FGO) to perform matrix multiplications in Fourier space. FourierGNN accommodates adequate expressiveness and achieves much lower complexity, which can effectively and efficiently accomplish the forecasting. Besides, our theoretical analysis reveals FGO's equivalence to graph convolutions in the time domain, which further verifies the validity of FourierGNN. Extensive experiments on seven datasets have demonstrated our superior performance with higher efficiency and fewer parameters compared with state-of-the-art methods.">
