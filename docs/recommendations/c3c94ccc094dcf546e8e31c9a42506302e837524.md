        <tr id="We present the first whiteness test for graphs, i.e., a whiteness test for multivariate time series associated with the nodes of a dynamic graph. The statistical test aims at finding serial dependencies among close-in-time observations, as well as spatial dependencies among neighboring observations given the underlying graph. The proposed test is a spatio-temporal extension of traditional tests from the system identification literature and finds applications in similar, yet more general, application scenarios involving graph signals. The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as is the case in many application scenarios like transportation networks and sensor grids. The asymptotic distribution -- as the number of graph edges or temporal observations increases -- is known, and does not assume identically distributed data. We validate the practical value of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and show how the test can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graphs stream.">

        <tr id="Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) haven proven to be an indispensable approach in modeling complex data, in particular spatial temporal data, e.g., relating to sensor data given as time series with according spatial information. Although GNNs provide powerful modeling capabilities on such kind of data, they require adequate input data in terms of both signal and the underlying graph structures. However, typically the according graphs are not automatically available or even predefined, such that typically an ad hoc graph representation needs to be constructed. However, often the construction of the underlying graph structure is given insufficient attention. Therefore, this paper performs an in-depth analysis of several methods for constructing graphs from a set of sensors attributed with spatial information, i.e., geographical coordinates, or using their respective attached signal data. We apply a diverse set of standard methods for estimating groups and similarities between graph nodes as location-based as well as signal-driven approaches on multiple benchmark datasets for evaluation and assessment. Here, for both areas, we specifically include distance-based, clustering-based, as well as correlation-based approaches for estimating the relationships between nodes for subsequent graph construction. In addition, we consider two different GNN approaches, i.e., regression and forecasting in order to enable a broader experimental assessment. Typically, no predefined graph is given, such that (ad hoc) graph creation is necessary. Here, our results indicate the criticality of factoring in the crucial step of graph construction into GNN-based research on spatial temporal data. Overall, in our experimentation no single approach for graph construction emerged as a clear winner. However, in our analysis we are able to provide specific indications based on the obtained results, for a specific class of methods. Collectively, the findings highlight the need for researchers to carefully consider graph construction when employing GNNs in the analysis of spatial temporal data.">

        <tr id="This article surveys heuristic-based and learning-based approaches for constructing adjacency matrices in Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based anomaly detection for multivariate time series (MTS). Effective adjacency matrix construction is crucial for GNN performance, enabling the model to capture dependencies between time series variables. Heuristic methods, like pairwise correlation, distance-based or dynamic time warping distances, offer simplicity but may struggle with complex relationships. Learning-based approaches, leveraging techniques such as attention mechanisms or graph learning layers, dynamically learn the graph structure from the data, potentially capturing more nuanced dependencies. This survey systematizes existing methods within both paradigms, comparing their strengths, weaknesses, computational complexities. Finally, it identifies open challenges and future research directions, focusing on improving computational time and accuracy of GNN-based anomaly detection using advanced graph construction techniques.">

        <tr id="The recovery of time-varying graph signals is a fundamental problem with numerous applications in sensor networks and forecasting in time series. Effectively capturing the spatiotemporal information in these signals is essential for the downstream tasks. Previous studies have used the smoothness of the temporal differences of such graph signals as an initial assumption. Nevertheless, this smoothness assumption could result in a degradation of performance in the corresponding application when the prior does not hold. In this work, we relax the requirement of this hypothesis by including a learning module. We propose a Time Graph Neural Network (TimeGNN) for the recovery of time-varying graph signals. Our algorithm uses an encoder-decoder architecture with a specialized loss composed of a mean squared error function and a Sobolev smoothness operator. TimeGNN shows competitive performance against previous methods in real datasets.">

        <tr id="Modeling heterogeneous correlated time series requires the ability to learn hidden dynamic relationships between component time series with possibly varying periodicities and generative processes. To address this challenge, we formulate and evaluate a windowed variance-correlation metric (WVC) designed to quantify time-varying correlations between signals. This method directly recovers hidden relationships in an specified time interval as a weighted adjacency matrix, consequently inferring hidden dynamic graph structure. On simulated data, our method captures correlations that other methods miss. The proposed method expands the ability to learn dynamic graph structure between significantly different signals within a single cohesive dynamical graph model.">

        <tr id="Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.">
