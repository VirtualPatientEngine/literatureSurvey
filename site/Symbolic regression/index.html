        <tr id="Significance Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.">

        <tr id="Machine learning offers an intriguing alternative to first-principle analysis for discovering new physics from experimental data. However, to date, purely data-driven methods have only proven successful in uncovering physical laws describing simple, low-dimensional systems with low levels of noise. Here we demonstrate that combining a data-driven methodology with some general physical principles enables discovery of a quantitatively accurate model of a non-equilibrium spatially extended system from high-dimensional data that is both noisy and incomplete. We illustrate this using an experimental weakly turbulent fluid flow where only the velocity field is accessible. We also show that this hybrid approach allows reconstruction of the inaccessible variables – the pressure and forcing field driving the flow. Reinbold et al. propose a physics-informed data-driven approach that successfully discovers a dynamical model using high-dimensional, noisy and incomplete experimental data describing a weakly turbulent fluid flow. This approach is relevant to other non-equilibrium spatially-extended systems.">

        <tr id="Significance Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science. The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.">

        <tr id="Understanding the interplay of order and disorder in chaos is a central challenge in modern quantitative science. Approximate linear representations of nonlinear dynamics have long been sought, driving considerable interest in Koopman theory. We present a universal, data-driven decomposition of chaos as an intermittently forced linear system. This work combines delay embedding and Koopman theory to decompose chaotic dynamics into a linear model in the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low-energy delay coordinates; this is called the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This analysis is applied to the Lorenz system and real-world examples including Earth’s magnetic field reversal and measles outbreaks. In each case, forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare intermittent forcing that precedes switching and bursting phenomena. The forcing activity demarcates coherent phase space regions where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are strongly nonlinear.The huge amount of data generated in fields like neuroscience or finance calls for effective strategies that mine data to reveal underlying dynamics. Here Brunton et al.develop a data-driven technique to analyze chaotic systems and predict their dynamics in terms of a forced linear model.">

        <tr id="Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.">

        <tr id="Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.">

        <tr id="Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.">

        <tr id="A key task in the field of modeling and analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems is the recovery of unknown governing equations from measurement data only. There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems (MANDy) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions. The efficiency of the introduced approach will be illustrated with the aid of several high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="First principles modeling of physical systems has led to significant technological advances across all branches of science. For nonlinear systems, however, small modeling errors can lead to significant deviations from the true, measured behavior. Even in mechanical systems, where the equations are assumed to be well-known, there are often model discrepancies corresponding to nonlinear friction, wind resistance, etc. Discovering models for these discrepancies remains an open challenge for many complex systems. In this work, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to discover a model for the discrepancy between a simplified model and measurement data. In particular, we assume that the model mismatch can be sparsely represented in a library of candidate model terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several examples including experimental data from a double pendulum on a cart. We further design and implement a feed-forward controller in simulations, showing improvement with a discrepancy model.">

However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further modification.">

        <tr id="Researchers propose sparse regression for identifying governing partial differential equations for spatiotemporal systems. We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.">

        <tr id="Sparse model identification enables the discovery of nonlinear dynamical systems purely from data; however, this approach is sensitive to noise, especially in the low-data limit. In this work, we leverage the statistical approach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to several synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate substantial improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected from 1900 to 1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be exploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.">

Sparse regression, in particular, has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: 1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning; 2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations; and 3) the methods apply to composite regularizers, essential for total variation (TV) as well as sparsity-promoting formulations using tight frames. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, and greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. Following standards of reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.">

        <tr id="Learning the governing equations of dynamical systems from data has drawn significant attention across diverse fields, including physics, engineering, robotics and control, economics, climate science, and healthcare. Sparse regression techniques, exemplified by the Automatic Regression for Governing Equations (ARGOS) framework, have demonstrated effectiveness in extracting parsimonious models from time series data. However, real-world dynamical systems are driven by input control, external forces, or human interventions, which standard ARGOS does not accommodate. To address this, we introduce ARGOS with control (ARGOSc), an extension of ARGOS that incorporates external control inputs into the system identification process. ARGOSc extends the sparse regression framework to infer governing equations while accounting for the effects of exogenous inputs, enabling robust identification of forcing dynamics in low- to medium-noise datasets. We demonstrate ARGOSc efficacy on benchmark systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, Lotka-Volterra, and the Lorenz system with forcing and feedback control, showing enhanced accuracy in discovering governing laws. Under the noisy conditions, ARGOSc outperforms the widely used sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with control (SINDYc), in accurately identifying the underlying forced dynamics. In some cases, SINDYc fails to capture the true system dynamics, whereas ARGOSc consistently succeeds.">

        <tr id="Identifying governing equations in physical and biological systems from datasets remains a long-standing challenge across various scientific disciplines. Common methods like sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) often rely on precise derivative approximations, making them sensitive to data scarcity and noise. This study presents a novel data-driven framework by integrating high order implicit Runge-Kutta methods (IRKs) with the sparse identification, termed IRK-SINDy. The framework exhibits remarkable robustness to data scarcity and noise by relying on the A-stability of IRKs and consequently their fewer limitations on stepsize. Two methods for incorporating IRKs into sparse regression are introduced: one employs iterative schemes for numerically solving nonlinear algebraic system of equations, while the other utilizes deep neural networks to predict stage values of IRKs. The performance of IRK-SINDy is demonstrated through numerical experiments on synthetic data in benchmark problems with varied dynamical behaviors, including linear and nonlinear oscillators, the Lorenz system, and biologically relevant models like predator-prey dynamics, logistic growth, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Results indicate that IRK-SINDy outperforms conventional SINDy and the RK4-SINDy framework, particularly under conditions of extreme data scarcity and noise, yielding interpretable and generalizable models.">

The process of learning ROMs is posed as a low-cost least-squares problem in a reduced-order subspace identified via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Numerical experiments on classical pattern-forming systems--including the Schnakenberg and Mimura--Tsujikawa models--demonstrate that higher-order surrogate models significantly improve prediction accuracy while maintaining low computational cost.

Runge-Kutta integration and total variation are imposed as constraints to ensure that the reconstructed state is a trajectory of a dynamical system that remains close to the original data. The trained INR yields a clean, continuous trajectory and provides accurate first-order derivatives via automatic differentiation.

Such systems often involve nonlinear feedbacks, delays, and interactions across scales. Classical modeling derives explicit governing equations, often systems of differential equations, by combining mechanistic assumptions, experimental observations, and known physical laws. The growing complexity of biological processes has, however, motivated complementary data-driven methods that aim to infer model structure directly from measurements, often without specifying equations a priori. In this review, we survey approaches for model discovery in biological dynamical systems, focusing on three methodological families: regression-based methods, network-based architectures, and decomposition techniques. We compare their ability to address three core goals: forecasting future states, identifying interactions, and characterizing system states. Representative methods are applied to a common benchmark, the Oregonator model, a minimal nonlinear oscillator that captures shared design principles of chemical and biological systems. By highlighting strengths, limitations, and interpretability, we aim to guide researchers in selecting tools for analyzing complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional dynamics in the life sciences.">

Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification. Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods across all challenges.">

        <tr id="Nonlinear system identification often involves a fundamental trade-off between interpretability and flexibility, often requiring the incorporation of physical constraints. We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines the mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the flexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the concept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear functions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is modeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation of the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based formalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which extends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the mathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC, which represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which uses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results show that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple polynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast, NN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex nonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip systems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based framework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities while maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the CCs. This balance makes it well-suited for modeling systems with discontinuities and complex nonlinearities that are challenging to assess using traditional polynomial or sparse regression methods, providing a powerful tool for nonlinear system identification.">

Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear, constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix. This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.">

Current inverse solution techniques are restricted to one-dimensional cases and typically depend on the availability of a priori system knowledge, thus limiting their applicability. By leveraging advances in data-driven sparse regression techniques, we develop the Multi-Dimensional Breakage Population Balance Equation Identification (mPBE ID) algorithm for discovering multi-dimensional breakage population balance equations (mPBEs) directly from data. Our mPBE-ID enables tractable identification of mPBEs by incorporating several key strategies, namely, a breakage-informed constrained sparse regression, targeted candidate library functions construction via insights from Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and robust handling of noisy/limited data through ensembling (bagging/bragging). Notably, we demonstrate how the DMD is indispensable for distilling dominant breakage dynamics which can then be used to facilitate the systematic inclusion of candidate library terms. We showcase the ability of the mPBE-ID to discover different forms of mPBE (including those with discontinuous stoichiometric kernels) even when tested against noisy and limited data. We anticipate that the mPBE-ID will serve as a foundational framework for future extensions to generalize the discovery of multi-dimensional PBEs for various high-dimensional particulate phenomena.">

Considering the physical situations where the data can be imperfect due to disturbances and measurement errors, we show that for many chaotic systems, widely used sparse-optimization methods for discovering governing equations produce models that depend sensitively on the measurement procedure, yet all such models generate virtually identical chaotic attractors, leading to a striking limitation that challenges the conventional notion of equation-based modeling in complex dynamical systems. Calculating the Koopman spectra, we find that the different sets of equations agree in their large eigenvalues and the differences begin to appear when the eigenvalues are smaller than an equation-dependent threshold. The results suggest that finding the governing equations of the system and attempting to interpret them physically may lead to misleading conclusions. It would be more useful to work directly with the available data using, e.g., machine-learning methods.">

In this article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed.

In contrast to widely used indirect methods-such as those based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)-which infer reaction dynamics by fitting numerically estimated derivatives, our approach fits entire trajectories by solving a dynamically constrained optimization problem. This formulation enables the construction of reduced CRNs that are both low-dimensional and sparse, while preserving key dynamical behaviors of the original system. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Through illustrative examples, including a Drosophila circadian oscillator and a glycolytic oscillator, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover accurate and interpretable reduced-order CRNs. Notably, the direct approach avoids the derivative estimation step and mitigates error accumulation issues inherent in indirect methods, making it a robust alternative for data-driven CRN realizations.">

We introduce the term"Physics-Informed Regression"(PIR) to describe the proposed data-driven hybrid technique as a way to bridge theory and data by use of ordinary least squares to efficiently perform parameter estimation of the model coefficients of different parameter-linear models; providing examples of models based on nonlinear ordinary equations (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE). The focus is on parameter estimation on a selection of ODE and PDE models, each illustrating performance in different model characteristics. For two relevant epidemic models of different complexity and number of parameters, PIR is tested and compared against the related technique, physics-informed neural networks (PINN), both on synthetic data generated from known target parameters and on real public Danish time series data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. Both methods were able to estimate the target parameters, while PIR showed to perform noticeably better, especially on a compartment model with higher complexity. Given the difference in computational speed, it is concluded that the PIR method is superior to PINN for the models considered. It is also demonstrated how PIR can be applied to estimate the time-varying parameters of a compartment model that is fitted using real Danish data from the COVID-19 pandemic obtained during a period from 2020 to 2021. The study shows how data-driven and physics-informed techniques may support reliable and fast -- possibly real-time -- parameter estimation in parameter-linear nonlinear dynamic models.">

        <tr id="Despite the recent proliferation of machine learning methods like SINDy that promise automatic discovery of governing equations from time-series data, there remain significant challenges to discovering models from noisy datasets. One reason is that the linear regression underlying these methods assumes that all noise resides in the training target (the regressand), which is the time derivative, whereas the measurement noise is in the states (the regressors). Recent methods like modified-SINDy and DySMHO address this error-in-variable problem by leveraging information from the model's temporal evolution, but they are also imposing the equation as a hard constraint, which effectively assumes no error in the regressand. Without relaxation, this hard constraint prevents assimilation of data longer than Lyapunov time. Instead, the fulfilment of the model equation should be treated as a soft constraint to account for the small yet critical error introduced by numerical truncation. The uncertainties in both the regressor and the regressand invite the use of orthogonal distance regression (ODR). By incorporating ODR with the Bayesian framework for model selection, we introduce a novel method for model discovery, termed ODR-BINDy, and assess its performance against current SINDy variants using the Lorenz63, Rossler, and Van Der Pol systems as case studies. Our findings indicate that ODR-BINDy consistently outperforms all existing methods in recovering the correct model from sparse and noisy datasets. For instance, our ODR-BINDy method reliably recovers the Lorenz63 equation from data with noise contamination levels of up to 30%.">

        <tr id="The Kalman filter is a fundamental tool for state estimation in dynamical systems. While originally developed for linear Gaussian settings, it has been extended to nonlinear problems through approaches such as the extended and unscented Kalman filters. Despite its broad use, a persistent limitation is that the underlying approximate model is fixed, which can lead to significant deviations from the true system dynamics. To address this limitation, we introduce the differentiable Kalman filter (DKF), an adjoint-based two-level optimization framework designed to reduce the mismatch between approximate and true dynamics. Within this framework, a field inversion step first uncovers the discrepancy, after which a closure model is trained to capture the discovered dynamics, allowing the filter to adapt flexibly and scale efficiently. We illustrate the capabilities of the DKF using two representative examples: a rocket dynamics model and the Allen-Cahn boundary value problem. In both cases, and across a range of noise levels, the DKF consistently reduces state reconstruction error by at least 90% compared to the classical Kalman filter, while also maintaining robust uncertainty quantification. These results demonstrate that the DKF not only improves estimation accuracy by large margins but also enhances interpretability and scalability, offering a principled pathway for combining data assimilation with modern machine learning.">

The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling.

        <tr id="Accurate numerical differentiation is crucial when preprocessing discrete data to enable discovery of underlying governing equations in a dynamical system, such as that required in implementing the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) approach. This is particularly important due to the sensitivity of finite-difference schemes to noise. Two common denoising techniques are polynomial interpolation for spatial derivatives and total variation regularization for temporal derivatives. However, these methods are ineffective for under-sampled datasets. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed data folding, to overcome this limitation for sparse periodic datasets. The method enhances numerical differentiation accuracy in proportion to the dataset size and phase accuracy and also reduces noise in the matrix of candidate functions. The effectiveness of data folding is demonstrated with four different under-sampled datasets: two essentially noiseless, artificially generated solutions of the Lorenz equations under periodic and double-periodic conditions, and two datasets from experiments involving acoustically forced combustion instabilities with low and high noise levels. In all cases, the numerical model generated by SINDy accurately reproduced the correct temporal dynamics only when data folding was applied beforehand.">

By decomposing the dynamics into a set of modes, each associated with a single frequency and a growth rate, DMD enables a natural modal decomposition and dimensionality reduction of complex dynamical systems. However, when DMD is applied to transient dynamics, even if a large number of modes are used, it remains difficult to interpret how these modes contribute to the transient behavior. In this study, we propose a simple extension of DMD to overcome this limitation by introducing time-varying amplitudes for the DMD modes based on sparsity and smoothness regularization. This approach enables identification of dynamically significant modes and extraction of their transient activities, providing a more interpretable and faithful representation of non-steady dynamics.

The core relies on the well-established SINDy algorithm for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. The proposed methodology combines recently proposed high-order estimates of drift and covariance for dealing with stochastic problems with augmented libraries to handle delayed arguments. Three different strategies are discussed in view of exploiting only realistically available data. A thorough comparative numerical investigation is performed on different models, which helps guiding the choice of effective and possibly outperforming schemes.">

The main technical component of our method is a new spectral filtering algorithm for linear dynamical systems, which incorporates past observations and applies to general noisy and marginally stable systems.

        <tr id="The real-time prediction of chaotic systems requires a nonlinear-reduced order model (ROM) to forecast the dynamics, and a stream of data from sensors to update the ROM. Data-driven ROMs are typically built with a two-step strategy: data compression in a lower-dimensional latent space, and prediction of the temporal dynamics on it. To achieve real-time prediction, however, there are two challenges to overcome: (i) ROMs of chaotic systems can become numerically unstable; and (ii) sensors'data are sparse, i.e., partial, and noisy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a three-step strategy: (i) a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) compresses the system's state onto a lower-dimensional latent space; (ii) a latent ROM (echo state network, ESN), which is formulated as a state-space model, predicts the temporal evolution on the latent space; and (iii) sequential data assimilation based on the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) adaptively corrects the latent ROM by assimilating noisy and sparse measurements. This provides a numerically stable method (DA-CAE-ESN), which corrects itself every time that data becomes available from sensors. The DA-CAE-ESN is tested on spatio-temporally chaotic partial differential equations: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation (Kolmogorov flow). We show that the method provides accurate and stable forecasts across different levels of noise, sparsity, and sampling rates. As a by-product, the DA-CAE-ESN acts as a localization strategy that mitigates spurious correlations, which arise when applying the EnKF to high-dimensional systems. The DA-CAE-ESN provides a numerically stable method to perform real-time predictions, which opens opportunities for deploying data-driven latent models.">

        <tr id="Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity, particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology, epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics. A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models, such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data. This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.">

        <tr id="This article explores novel data-driven modeling approaches for analyzing and approximating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), a physiologically-based metric integrating multiple atmospheric variables to assess thermal comfort. Given the nonlinear, multivariate structure of UTCI, we investigate symbolic and sparse regression techniques as tools for interpretable and efficient function approximation. In particular, we highlight the benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre polynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in stability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly lower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial benchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, we construct models that efficiently populate a Pareto front of accuracy versus complexity and exhibit stable, hierarchical coefficient structures across varying model capacities. Training on just 20% of the data, our models generalize robustly to the remaining 80%, with consistent performance under bootstrapping. The decomposition effectively approximates the UTCI as a Fourier-like expansion in an orthogonal basis, yielding results near the theoretical optimum in the L2 (least squares) sense. We also connect these findings to the broader context of equation discovery in environmental modeling, referencing probabilistic grammar-based methods that enforce domain consistency and compactness in symbolic expressions. Taken together, these results illustrate how combining sparsity, orthogonality, and symbolic structure enables robust, interpretable modeling of complex environmental indices like UTCI - and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approximation in both accuracy and efficiency.">

While machine learning has recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous, data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations, presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of data available.">

Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE (MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN), demonstrating good accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency.">

        <tr id="Developing physically consistent closure models is a longstanding challenge in simulating plasma turbulence, even in minimal systems such as the two-field Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) model, which captures essential features of drift-wave turbulence with a reduced set of variables. In this work, we leverage theoretical insights from Direct Interaction Approximation (DIA) to construct a six-term closure structure that captures the dominant turbulent transport processes, including both diffusion and hyper-diffusion. While the mathematical form of the closure is fully prescribed by DIA, the corresponding transport coefficients are learned from data using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The resulting Extended HW model with Closure (EHW-C) model reveals several nontrivial features of plasma turbulence: notably, some inferred coefficients become negative in certain regimes, indicating inverse transport, a phenomenon absent in conventional closure models. Moreover, the EHW-C model accurately reproduces the spectral and flux characteristics of high-resolution Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), while requiring only one-eighth the spatial resolution per direction, yielding a tenfold speed-up. This work demonstrates how theory-guided machine learning can both enhance computational efficiency and uncover emergent transport mechanisms in strongly nonlinear plasma systems.">

        <tr id="Scientific discovery drives progress across disciplines, from fundamental physics to industrial applications. However, identifying physical laws automatically from gathered datasets requires identifying the structure and parameters of the formula underlying the data, which involves navigating a vast search space and consuming substantial computational resources. To address these issues, we build on the Buckingham $\Pi$ theorem and Taylor's theorem to create a unified representation of diverse formulas, which introduces latent variables to form a two-stage structure. To minimize the search space, we initially focus on determining the structure of the latent formula, including the relevant contributing inputs, the count of latent variables, and their interconnections. Following this, the process of parameter identification is expedited by enforcing dimensional constraints for physical relevance, favoring simplicity in the formulas, and employing strategic optimization techniques. Any overly complex outcomes are refined using symbolic regression for a compact form. These general strategic techniques drastically reduce search iterations from hundreds of millions to just tens, significantly enhancing the efficiency of data-driven formula discovery. We performed comprehensive validation to demonstrate FIND's effectiveness in discovering physical laws, dimensionless numbers, partial differential equations, and uniform critical system parameters across various fields, including astronomy, physics, chemistry, and electronics. The excellent performances across 11 distinct datasets position FIND as a powerful and versatile tool for advancing data-driven scientific discovery in multiple domains.">

Existing parameter estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics, multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering, healthcare, and beyond.">

        <tr id="Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long time integration of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local"stencil"states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps'worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented synthetic stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories.">

Using a bi-level optimization framework, we model system identification as an inner problem and predictive control as an outer problem. Within this framework, we show that several regularized DDPC formulations, including l1-norm penalties, projection-based regularizers, and a newly introduced causality-based regularizer, can be viewed as convex relaxations of their respective bi-level problems. This perspective clarifies the conceptual links between direct and indirect data-driven control and highlights how regularization implicitly enforces system identification. We further propose an optimality-based variant, O-DDPC, which approximately solves the inner problem with all identification constraints via an iterative algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that O-DDPC outperforms existing regularized DDPC by reducing both bias and variance errors. These results indicate that further benefits may be obtained by applying system identification techniques to pre-process the trajectory library in nonlinear settings. Overall, our analysis contributes to a unified convex relaxation view of regularization in DDPC and sheds light on its strong empirical performance beyond linear time-invariant systems.">

Even the most powerful AI- or physics-based forecast system suffer from gradual error accumulation. Data assimilation (DA) aims to mitigate these errors by optimally blending (noisy) observations with prior model forecasts, but conventional variational methods often assume Gaussian error statistics that fail to capture the true, non-Gaussian behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. We propose PnP-DA, a Plug-and-Play algorithm that alternates (1) a lightweight, gradient-based analysis update (using a Mahalanobis-distance misfit on new observations) with (2) a single forward pass through a pretrained generative prior conditioned on the background forecast via a conditional Wasserstein coupling. This strategy relaxes restrictive statistical assumptions and leverages rich historical data without requiring an explicit regularization functional, and it also avoids the need to backpropagate gradients through the complex neural network that encodes the prior during assimilation cycles. Experiments on standard chaotic testbeds demonstrate that this strategy consistently reduces forecast errors across a range of observation sparsities and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods.">

Our method can handle linear and nonlinear high-order SPDEs driven by time-dependent Wiener processes with both additive or multiplicative structures. Theoretically, we establish a rigorous connection between the spectral properties of the solution's mean and covariance and the identifiability of the underlying SPDEs. Our analysis covers key classes of equations, including linear SPDEs with constant coefficients, as well as parabolic and hyperbolic types, generalizing the theory of identification of deterministic PDEs. Algorithmically, the drift term is identified using a sample mean generalization of Robust-IDENT (He et al., 2023). For the diffusion term, we develop a new greedy algorithm, Quadratic Subspace Pursuit (QSP), which can address general sparse regression problems with quadratic measurements. We validate Stoch-IDENT extensively on various SPDEs, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.">

For the computation of this metric, we delineate the uncertainty contributions arising from control actions, system dynamics, and initial conditions. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical findings, we establish connections between these new results and the existing literature on the robustness of model reduction.

We propose a combined manifold and machine learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete microscopic data (pedestrians'positions) using KDE. In the second step, based on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this"embed->learn in latent space->lift back to the ambient space"pipeline, we create an effective solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution. For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from agent-based simulations.">

The approach exploits the inherent hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time. Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.">

It brings together four strands: (1) core models for systems that evolve with randomness; (2) learning key parts of those models directly from data; (3) methods that can generate realistic synthetic data in continuous time; and (4) numerical techniques that keep simulations stable, accurate, and faithful over long runs. The objective is practical: help researchers quickly see what is new, how the pieces fit together, and where important gaps remain. We summarize tools for estimating changing infection or reaction rates under noisy and incomplete observations, modeling spatial spread, accounting for sudden jumps and heavy tails, and reporting uncertainty in a way that is useful for decisions. We also highlight open problems that deserve near-term attention: separating true dynamics from noise when data are irregular; learning spatial dynamics under random influences with guarantees of stability; aligning training with the numerical method used in applications; preserving positivity and conservation in all simulations; reducing cost while controlling error for large studies; estimating rare but important events; and adopting clear, comparable reporting standards. By organizing the field around these aims, the review offers a concise guide to current methods, their practical use, and the most promising directions for future work in biology and epidemiology.s.">

The methodology, trained and tested on high-fidelity simulations of two-dimensional wing-gust encounters with sparse pressure data, combines physics-based ensemble filtering with data-driven surrogate modeling in a learned low-order space. Within this reduced space, latent dynamics and sensor observation operators are learned using neural networks, enabling efficient modeling of complex aerodynamic responses. These components are embedded within a low-rank Ensemble Kalman Filter (LREnKF), yielding a computationally efficient scheme that combines data-driven expressivity with physical interpretability in the original high-dimensional space. Because assimilation occurs entirely within the latent space, updates are fast enough for real-time use, ensuring that aerodynamic states can be continuously estimated from streaming pressure data. The filter corrects predictions predominantly in directions that are both dynamically significant and observable, improving efficiency and reducing spurious adjustments. An observability analysis shows how sensor informativeness evolves during wing-gust interactions, and sensor dropout experiments demonstrate that the LREnKF adaptively re-weights neighboring sensors to preserve estimation quality under degraded sensing.">

This enables adaptive learning through iterative refinement of the solution as new data becomes available.

Building upon theorems of Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss.

 Inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant challenges due to their ill-posed nature and reliance on sparse or noisy observations. Traditional approaches often require complete knowledge of initial and boundary conditions, which may not be available in practical scenarios. Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a powerful approach for addressing such problems by embedding physical laws into the structure of deep neural networks. In this work, we employ PINNs to solve the inverse problem for the Gardner-Kawahara equation, a high-order nonlinear dispersive PDE that modeling wave propagation in fluids and plasmas. The proposed PINNs framework accurately reconstructs unknown parameters and solution fields from limited data, even in the presence of noise. Numerical experiments conducted under varying parameter settings and noise levels demonstrate strong agreement with exact solutions, thereby highlighting the method’s accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. These results confirm the potential of PINNs for inverse modeling of complex nonlinear systems, even in the absence of complete initial or boundary information, and demonstrate that they outperform traditional methods in handling sparse and noisy data.">

We propose modeling trajectories of noisy pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and various real-world settings.

The first stage leverages physics-based DKL to train a surrogate model, which jointly yields an optimized neural network feature extractor and robust initial estimates for the PDE parameters. In the second stage, with the neural network weights fixed, HMC is employed within a full Bayesian framework to efficiently sample the joint posterior distribution of the kernel hyperparameters and the PDE parameters. Numerical experiments on canonical and high-dimensional inverse PDE problems demonstrate that our framework accurately estimates parameters, provides reliable uncertainty estimates, and effectively addresses challenges of data sparsity and model complexity, offering a robust and scalable tool for diverse scientific and engineering applications.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification, time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.">
