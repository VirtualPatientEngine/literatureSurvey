        <tr id="Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.">

        <tr id="In many domains, including healthcare, biology, and climate science, time series are irregularly sampled with varying time intervals between successive readouts and different subsets of variables (sensors) observed at different time points. Here, we introduce RAINDROP, a graph neural network that embeds irregularly sampled and multivariate time series while also learning the dynamics of sensors purely from observational data. RAINDROP represents every sample as a separate sensor graph and models time-varying dependencies between sensors with a novel message passing operator. It estimates the latent sensor graph structure and leverages the structure together with nearby observations to predict misaligned readouts. This model can be interpreted as a graph neural network that sends messages over graphs that are optimized for capturing time-varying dependencies among sensors. We use RAINDROP to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. RAINDROP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 11.4% (absolute F1-score points), including techniques that deal with irregular sampling using fixed discretization and set functions. RAINDROP shows superiority in diverse setups, including challenging leave-sensor-out settings.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have shown to be effective in time series forecasting applications, achieving better performance than standard univariate predictors in several settings. These architectures take advantage of a graph structure and relational inductive biases to learn a single (global) inductive model to predict any number of the input time series, each associated with a graph node. Despite the gain achieved in computational and data efficiency w.r.t. fitting a set of local models, relying on a single global model can be a limitation whenever some of the time series are generated by a different spatiotemporal stochastic process. The main objective of this paper is to understand the interplay between globality and locality in graph-based spatiotemporal forecasting, while contextually proposing a methodological framework to rationalize the practice of including trainable node embeddings in such architectures. We ascribe to trainable node embeddings the role of amortizing the learning of specialized components. Moreover, embeddings allow for 1) effectively combining the advantages of shared message-passing layers with node-specific parameters and 2) efficiently transferring the learned model to new node sets. Supported by strong empirical evidence, we provide insights and guidelines for specializing graph-based models to the dynamics of each time series and show how this aspect plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate predictions.">

        <tr id="Outstanding achievements of graph neural networks for spatiotemporal time series analysis show that relational constraints introduce an effective inductive bias into neural forecasting architectures. Often, however, the relational information characterizing the underlying data-generating process is unavailable and the practitioner is left with the problem of inferring from data which relational graph to use in the subsequent processing stages. We propose novel, principled - yet practical - probabilistic score-based methods that learn the relational dependencies as distributions over graphs while maximizing end-to-end the performance at task. The proposed graph learning framework is based on consolidated variance reduction techniques for Monte Carlo score-based gradient estimation, is theoretically grounded, and, as we show, effective in practice. In this paper, we focus on the time series forecasting problem and show that, by tailoring the gradient estimators to the graph learning problem, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance while controlling the sparsity of the learned graph and the computational scalability. We empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that the proposed solution can be used as a stand-alone graph identification procedure as well as a graph learning component of an end-to-end forecasting architecture.">

        <tr id="Graph-based deep learning methods have become popular tools to process collections of correlated time series. Differently from traditional multivariate forecasting methods, neural graph-based predictors take advantage of pairwise relationships by conditioning forecasts on a (possibly dynamic) graph spanning the time series collection. The conditioning can take the form of an architectural inductive bias on the neural forecasting architecture, resulting in a family of deep learning models called spatiotemporal graph neural networks. Such relational inductive biases enable the training of global forecasting models on large time-series collections, while at the same time localizing predictions w.r.t. each element in the set (i.e., graph nodes) by accounting for local correlations among them (i.e., graph edges). Indeed, recent theoretical and practical advances in graph neural networks and deep learning for time series forecasting make the adoption of such processing frameworks appealing and timely. However, most of the studies in the literature focus on proposing variations of existing neural architectures by taking advantage of modern deep learning practices, while foundational and methodological aspects have not been subject to systematic investigation. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive methodological framework that formalizes the forecasting problem and provides design principles for graph-based predictive models and methods to assess their performance. At the same time, together with an overview of the field, we provide design guidelines, recommendations, and best practices, as well as an in-depth discussion of open challenges and future research directions.">

        <tr id="By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.">

        <tr id="Attention mechanisms have been widely used to capture long-range dependencies among nodes in Graph Transformers. Bottlenecked by the quadratic computational cost, attention mechanisms fail to scale in large graphs. Recent improvements in computational efficiency are mainly achieved by attention sparsification with random or heuristic-based graph subsampling, which falls short in data-dependent context reasoning. State space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have gained prominence for their effectiveness and efficiency in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, adapting SSMs to non-sequential graph data presents a notable challenge. In this work, we introduce Graph-Mamba, the first attempt to enhance long-range context modeling in graph networks by integrating a Mamba block with the input-dependent node selection mechanism. Specifically, we formulate graph-centric node prioritization and permutation strategies to enhance context-aware reasoning, leading to a substantial improvement in predictive performance. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-range graph prediction tasks, with a fraction of the computational cost in both FLOPs and GPU memory consumption.

        <tr id="Deep learning for time series forecasting has traditionally operated within a one-model-per-dataset framework, limiting its potential to leverage the game-changing impact of large pre-trained models. The concept of universal forecasting, emerging from pre-training on a vast collection of time series datasets, envisions a single Large Time Series Model capable of addressing diverse downstream forecasting tasks. However, constructing such a model poses unique challenges specific to time series data: i) cross-frequency learning, ii) accommodating an arbitrary number of variates for multivariate time series, and iii) addressing the varying distributional properties inherent in large-scale data. To address these challenges, we present novel enhancements to the conventional time series Transformer architecture, resulting in our proposed Masked Encoder-based Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformer (Moirai). Trained on our newly introduced Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA) featuring over 27B observations across nine domains, Moirai achieves competitive or superior performance as a zero-shot forecaster when compared to full-shot models.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.">

        <tr id="Large pre-trained models excel in zero/few-shot learning for language and vision tasks but face challenges in multivariate time series (TS) forecasting due to diverse data characteristics. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1.

        <tr id="Pre-training on time series poses a unique challenge due to the potential mismatch between pre-training and target domains, such as shifts in temporal dynamics, fast-evolving trends, and long-range and short-cyclic effects, which can lead to poor downstream performance. While domain adaptation methods can mitigate these shifts, most methods need examples directly from the target domain, making them suboptimal for pre-training. To address this challenge, methods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and be capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training. Relative to other modalities, in time series, we expect that time-based and frequency-based representations of the same example are located close together in the time-frequency space. To this end, we posit that time-frequency consistency (TF-C) -- embedding a time-based neighborhood of an example close to its frequency-based neighborhood -- is desirable for pre-training. Motivated by TF-C, we define a decomposable pre-training model, where the self-supervised signal is provided by the distance between time and frequency components, each individually trained by contrastive estimation. We evaluate the new method on eight datasets, including electrodiagnostic testing, human activity recognition, mechanical fault detection, and physical status monitoring. Experiments against eight state-of-the-art methods show that TF-C outperforms baselines by 15.4% (F1 score) on average in one-to-one settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model on EMG data) and by 8.4% (precision) in challenging one-to-many settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model for either hand-gesture recognition or mechanical fault prediction), reflecting the breadth of scenarios that arise in real-world applications.

        <tr id="Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations. Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series models remains a formidable problem. We present Raincoat, the first model for both closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. Raincoat addresses feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection of private labels. Additionally, Raincoat improves transferability by identifying label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art UDA methods demonstrate that Raincoat can improve transfer learning performance by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.">

The proposed AZ-test can be intended as a spatio-temporal extension of traditional tests designed for system identiﬁcation to graph signals. The AZ-test is versatile, allowing the underlying graph to be dynamic, changing in topology and set of nodes over time, and weighted, thus accounting for connections of different strength, as it is the case in many application scenarios like sensor and transportation networks. The asymptotic distribution of the designed test can be derived under the null hypothesis without assuming identically distributed data. We show the effectiveness of the test on both synthetic and real-world problems, and illustrate how it can be employed to assess the quality of spatio-temporal forecasting models by analyzing the prediction residuals appended to the graph stream.">

The manuscript aims, for the first time, at filling this gap by matching state-space modeling and spatio-temporal data where the relational information, say the functional graph capturing latent dependencies, is learned directly from data and is allowed to change over time. Within a probabilistic formulation that accounts for the uncertainty in the data-generating process, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn the state-space model end-to-end on a downstream task.

        <tr id="The challenge of effectively learning inter-series correlations for multivariate time series forecasting remains a substantial and unresolved problem. Traditional deep learning models, which are largely dependent on the Transformer paradigm for modeling long sequences, often fail to integrate information from multiple time series into a coherent and universally applicable model. To bridge this gap, our paper presents ForecastGrapher, a framework reconceptualizes multivariate time series forecasting as a node regression task, providing a unique avenue for capturing the intricate temporal dynamics and inter-series correlations. Our approach is underpinned by three pivotal steps: firstly, generating custom node embeddings to reflect the temporal variations within each series; secondly, constructing an adaptive adjacency matrix to encode the inter-series correlations; and thirdly, augmenting the GNNs' expressive power by diversifying the node feature distribution. To enhance this expressive power, we introduce the Group Feature Convolution GNN (GFC-GNN). This model employs a learnable scaler to segment node features into multiple groups and applies one-dimensional convolutions with different kernel lengths to each group prior to the aggregation phase. Consequently, the GFC-GNN method enriches the diversity of node feature distribution in a fully end-to-end fashion. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that ForecastGrapher surpasses strong baselines and leading published techniques in the domain of multivariate time series forecasting.">

        <tr id="The widespread adoption of scalable mobile sensing has led to large amounts of time series data for real-world applications. A fundamental application is multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which aims to predict future time series values based on historical observations. Existing MTSF methods suffer from limited parameterization and small-scale training data. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced in time series, which achieve promising forecasting performance but incur heavy computational costs. To solve these challenges, we propose TimeCMA, an LLM-empowered framework for time series forecasting with cross-modality alignment. We design a dual-modality encoding module with two branches, where the time series encoding branch extracts relatively low-quality yet pure embeddings of time series through an inverted Transformer. In addition, the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series as prompts to obtain high-quality yet entangled prompt embeddings via a Pre-trained LLM. Then, we design a cross-modality alignment module to retrieve high-quality and pure time series embeddings from the prompt embeddings. Moreover, we develop a time series forecasting module to decode the aligned embeddings while capturing dependencies among multiple variables for forecasting. Notably, we tailor the prompt to encode sufficient temporal information into a last token and design the last token embedding storage to reduce computational costs. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.">

        <tr id="Time series forecasting (TSF) is crucial in fields like economic forecasting, weather prediction, traffic flow analysis, and public health surveillance. Real-world time series data often include noise, outliers, and missing values, making accurate forecasting challenging. Traditional methods model point-to-point relationships, which limits their ability to capture complex temporal patterns and increases their susceptibility to noise.To address these issues, we introduce the WindowMixer model, built on an all-MLP framework. WindowMixer leverages the continuous nature of time series by examining temporal variations from a window-based perspective. It decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components, handling them individually. For trends, a fully connected (FC) layer makes predictions. For seasonal components, time windows are projected to produce window tokens, processed by Intra-Window-Mixer and Inter-Window-Mixer modules. The Intra-Window-Mixer models relationships within each window, while the Inter-Window-Mixer models relationships between windows. This approach captures intricate patterns and long-range dependencies in the data.Experiments show WindowMixer consistently outperforms existing methods in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.">

        <tr id="Time series imputation plays a crucial role in various real-world systems and has been extensively explored. Models for time series imputation often require specialization, necessitating distinct designs for different domains and missing patterns. In this study, we introduce NuwaTS, a framework to repurpose Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for general time series imputation. Once trained, this model can be applied to imputation tasks on incomplete time series from any domain with any missing patterns. We begin by devising specific embeddings for each sub-series patch of the incomplete time series. These embeddings encapsulate information about the patch itself, the missing data patterns within the patch, and the patch's statistical characteristics. To enhance the model's adaptability to different missing patterns, we propose a contrastive learning approach to make representations of the same patch more similar across different missing patterns. By combining this contrastive loss with the missing data imputation task, we train PLMs to obtain a one-for-all imputation model. Furthermore, we utilize a plug-and-play layer-wise fine-tuning approach to train domain-specific models. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging a dataset of over seventeen million time series from diverse domains, we obtain a one-for-all imputation model which outperforms existing domain-specific models across various datasets and missing patterns. Additionally, we find that NuwaTS can be generalized to other time series tasks such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained significant traction in the forecasting domain, especially for their capacity to simultaneously account for intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series relationships. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical GNN (DeepHGNN) framework, explicitly designed for forecasting in complex hierarchical structures. The uniqueness of DeepHGNN lies in its innovative graph-based hierarchical interpolation and an end-to-end reconciliation mechanism. This approach ensures forecast accuracy and coherence across various hierarchical levels while sharing signals across them, addressing a key challenge in hierarchical forecasting. A critical insight in hierarchical time series is the variance in forecastability across levels, with upper levels typically presenting more predictable components. DeepHGNN capitalizes on this insight by pooling and leveraging knowledge from all hierarchy levels, thereby enhancing the overall forecast accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation set against several state-of-the-art models confirm the superior performance of DeepHGNN. This research not only demonstrates DeepHGNN's effectiveness in achieving significantly improved forecast accuracy but also contributes to the understanding of graph-based methods in hierarchical time series forecasting.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based models have emerged as powerful tools for multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, existing Transformer models often fall short of capturing both intricate dependencies across variate and temporal dimensions in MTS data. Some recent models are proposed to separately capture variate and temporal dependencies through either two sequential or parallel attention mechanisms. However, these methods cannot directly and explicitly learn the intricate inter-series and intra-series dependencies. In this work, we first demonstrate that these dependencies are very important as they usually exist in real-world data. To directly model these dependencies, we propose a transformer-based model UniTST containing a unified attention mechanism on the flattened patch tokens. Additionally, we add a dispatcher module which reduces the complexity and makes the model feasible for a potentially large number of variates. Although our proposed model employs a simple architecture, it offers compelling performance as shown in our extensive experiments on several datasets for time series forecasting.">

Recent findings have indicated that simpler linear models might outperform complex Transformer-based approaches, highlighting the potential for more streamlined architectures.

To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional Transformer framework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention mechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as queries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term forecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory usage.

Recent works model the relations between time-series as graphs and have shown that propagating information over the relation graph can improve time series forecasting. However, in many cases, relational information is not available or is noisy and reliable. Moreover, most works ignore the underlying uncertainty of time-series both for structure learning and deriving the forecasts resulting in the structure not capturing the uncertainty resulting in forecast distributions with poor uncertainty estimates. We tackle this challenge and introduce STOIC, that leverages stochastic correlations between time-series to learn underlying structure between time-series and to provide well-calibrated and accurate forecasts. Over a wide-range of benchmark datasets STOIC provides around 16% more accurate and 14% better-calibrated forecasts. STOIC also shows better adaptation to noise in data during inference and captures important and useful relational information in various benchmarks.">

        <tr id="With the increasing collection of time series data from various domains, there arises a strong demand for general time series forecasting models pre-trained on a large number of time-series datasets to support a variety of downstream prediction tasks. Enabling general time series forecasting faces two challenges: how to obtain unified representations from multi-domian time series data, and how to capture domain-specific features from time series data across various domains for adaptive transfer in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a Register Assisted General Time Series Forecasting Model with Decomposed Frequency Learning (ROSE), a novel pre-trained model for time series forecasting. ROSE employs Decomposed Frequency Learning for the pre-training task, which decomposes coupled semantic and periodic information in time series with frequency-based masking and reconstruction to obtain unified representations across domains. We also equip ROSE with a Time Series Register, which learns to generate a register codebook to capture domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances domain-adaptive transfer by selecting related register tokens on downstream tasks. After pre-training on large-scale time series data, ROSE achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 8 real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, even in few-shot scenarios, it demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods trained with full data.">

A recent model, Mamba, based on selective state space models (SSMs), has emerged as a competitive alternative to Transformer, offering comparable performance with higher throughput and linear complexity related to sequence length. In this study, we analyze the limitations of current Mamba in LTSF and propose four targeted improvements, leading to MambaTS. We first introduce variable scan along time to arrange the historical information of all the variables together. We suggest that causal convolution in Mamba is not necessary for LTSF and propose the Temporal Mamba Block (TMB). We further incorporate a dropout mechanism for selective parameters of TMB to mitigate model overfitting. Moreover, we tackle the issue of variable scan order sensitivity by introducing variable permutation training. We further propose variable-aware scan along time to dynamically discover variable relationships during training and decode the optimal variable scan order by solving the shortest path visiting all nodes problem during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on eight public datasets demonstrate that MambaTS achieves new state-of-the-art performance.">

Particularly, the emergence of pre-trained LLMs-based temporal works, compared to previous deep model approaches, has demonstrated superior generalization and robustness, showcasing the potential of generative pre-trained paradigms as foundation models for time series. However, those LLMs-based works mainly focus on cross-modal research, i.e., leveraging the language capabilities of LLMs in time series contexts. Although they have achieved impressive performance, there still exist the issues of concept drift caused by differences in data distribution and inflexibility caused by misalignment of dimensions. To this end, inspired by recent work on LVMs, we reconsider the paradigm of time series modeling. In this paper, we comprehensively explore, for the first time, the effectiveness and superiority of the Generative Pre-trained Diffusion (GPD) paradigm in real-world multivariate time series forecasting (TSF). Specifically, to mitigate performance bias introduced by sophisticated networks, we propose a straightforward MLP diffusion network for unconditional modeling of time series. Then we employ a zero-shot and tuning-free method to predict (generate) future data using historical data as prompts. The GPD paradigm is established on the time series modality, effectively preventing the phenomenon of concept drift, and enabling flexible forecasting of arbitrary lengths. We demonstrate that the GPD paradigm achieves comprehensive performance and generalization comparable to current SOTA LLM-based and deep model paradigms on mainstream benchmarks and various TSF tasks. Extensive experiments validate the potential of the GPD paradigm and its assistance in future related research.">

Recent advancements in transformer-based techniques have enhanced capabilities in forecasting and imputation; however, these methods are still resource-heavy, lack adaptability, and face difficulties in integrating both local and global attributes of time series. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new architectural concept for time series analysis based on introspection. Central to this concept is the self-supervised pretraining of Time Series Representation Models (TSRMs), which once learned can be easily tailored and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, in an automated and resource-efficient manner. Our architecture is equipped with a flexible and hierarchical representation learning process, which is robust against missing data and outliers. It can capture and learn both local and global features of the structure, semantics, and crucial patterns of a given time series category, such as heart rate data. Our learned time series representation models can be efficiently adapted to a specific task, such as forecasting or imputation, without manual intervention. Furthermore, our architecture's design supports explainability by highlighting the significance of each input value for the task at hand. Our empirical study using four benchmark datasets shows that, compared to investigated state-of-the-art baseline methods, our architecture improves imputation and forecasting errors by up to 90.34% and 71.54%, respectively, while reducing the required trainable parameters by up to 92.43%.

        <tr id="In recent years, significant progress has been made in multivariate time series forecasting using Linear-based, Transformer-based, and Convolution-based models. However, these approaches face notable limitations: linear forecasters struggle with representation capacities, attention mechanisms suffer from quadratic complexity, and convolutional models have a restricted receptive field. These constraints impede their effectiveness in modeling complex time series, particularly those with numerous variables. Additionally, many models adopt the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy, treating multivariate time series as uncorrelated univariate series while ignoring their correlations. For models considering inter-channel relationships, whether through the self-attention mechanism, linear combination, or convolution, they all incur high computational costs and focus solely on weighted summation relationships, neglecting potential proportional relationships between channels. In this work, we address these issues by leveraging the newly introduced state space model and propose \textbf{C-Mamba}, a novel approach that captures cross-channel dependencies while maintaining linear complexity without losing the global receptive field. Our model consists of two key components: (i) channel mixup, where two channels are mixed to enhance the training sets; (ii) channel attention enhanced patch-wise Mamba encoder that leverages the ability of the state space models to capture cross-time dependencies and models correlations between channels by mining their weight relationships. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven real-world time series datasets. Moreover, the proposed mixup and attention strategy exhibits strong generalizability across other frameworks.">

        <tr id="Pretraining plays a pivotal role in acquiring generalized knowledge from large-scale data, achieving remarkable successes as evidenced by large models in CV and NLP. However, progress in the graph domain remains limited due to fundamental challenges such as feature heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity. Recently, increasing efforts have been made to enhance node feature quality with Large Language Models (LLMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs), demonstrating superiority to traditional bag-of-words or word2vec techniques. These high-quality node features reduce the previously critical role of graph structure, resulting in a modest performance gap between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and structure-agnostic Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Motivated by this, we introduce a feature-centric pretraining perspective by treating graph structure as a prior and leveraging the rich, unified feature space to learn refined interaction patterns that generalizes across graphs. Our framework, Graph Sequence Pretraining with Transformer (GSPT), samples node contexts through random walks and employs masked feature reconstruction to capture pairwise proximity in the LLM-unified feature space using a standard Transformer. By utilizing unified text representations rather than varying structures, our framework achieves significantly better transferability among graphs within the same domain. GSPT can be easily adapted to both node classification and link prediction, demonstrating promising empirical success on various datasets.">

To address this, Graph Transformers (GTs) were introduced, utilizing self-attention mechanism to effectively model pairwise node relationships.

In this work, we present Graph-Enhanced Contextual Operator (GECO), a scalable and effective alternative to GTs that leverages neighborhood propagation and global convolutions to effectively capture local and global dependencies in quasilinear time. Our study on synthetic datasets reveals that GECO reaches 169x speedup on a graph with 2M nodes w.r.t. optimized attention. Further evaluations on diverse range of benchmarks showcase that GECO scales to large graphs where traditional GTs often face memory and time limitations. Notably, GECO consistently achieves comparable or superior quality compared to baselines, improving the SOTA up to 4.5%, and offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale graph learning.">

To address this limitation, we present DeformTime, a neural network architecture that attempts to capture correlated temporal patterns from the input space, and hence, improve forecasting accuracy. It deploys two core operations performed by deformable attention blocks (DABs): learning dependencies across variables from different time steps (variable DAB), and preserving temporal dependencies in data from previous time steps (temporal DAB). Input data transformation is explicitly designed to enhance learning from the deformed series of information while passing through a DAB. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 MTS data sets, using previously established benchmarks as well as challenging infectious disease modelling tasks with more exogenous variables. The results demonstrate that DeformTime improves accuracy against previous competitive methods across the vast majority of MTS forecasting tasks, reducing the mean absolute error by 10% on average. Notably, performance gains remain consistent across longer forecasting horizons.">

However, real-world time series exhibit pronounced non-stationary distribution characteristics. These characteristics are not solely limited to time-varying statistical properties highlighted by non-stationary Transformer but also encompass three key aspects: nested periodicity, absence of periodic distributions, and hysteresis among time variables. In this paper, we begin by validating this theory through wavelet analysis and propose the Transformer-based TwinS model, which consists of three modules to address the non-stationary periodic distributions: Wavelet Convolution, Period-Aware Attention, and Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP. Specifically, The Wavelet Convolution models nested periods by scaling the convolution kernel size like wavelet transform. The Period-Aware Attention guides attention computation by generating period relevance scores through a convolutional sub-network. The Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP captures the overall relationships between time series through channel-time mixing learning.

Specifically, MGCP utilizes Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators and Graph Convolutional Networks to learn the global spatiotemporal correlations and inter-series correlations, enabling the extraction of potential features from multivariate time series at fine-grained and medium-grained levels. Additionally, MGCP employs adversarial training with an attention mechanism-based predictor and conditional discriminator to optimize prediction results at coarse-grained level, ensuring high fidelity between the generated forecast results and the actual data distribution. Finally, we compare MGCP with several state-of-the-art time series prediction algorithms on real-world benchmark datasets, and our results demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the proposed model.">

        <tr id="Transformer architectures have shown promising results in time series processing. However, despite recent advances in subquadratic attention mechanisms or state-space models, processing very long sequences still imposes significant computational requirements. Token merging, which involves replacing multiple tokens with a single one calculated as their linear combination, has shown to considerably improve the throughput of vision transformer architectures while maintaining accuracy. In this work, we go beyond computer vision and perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both time series transformers and state-space models. To effectively scale token merging to long sequences, we introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, adjusting the computational complexity from linear to quadratic based on the neighborhood size. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that token merging offers substantial computational benefits with minimal impact on accuracy across various models and datasets. On the recently proposed Chronos foundation model, we achieve accelerations up to 5400% with only minor accuracy degradations.">

        <tr id="The non-stationary nature of real-world Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data presents forecasting models with a formidable challenge of the time-variant distribution of time series, referred to as distribution shift. Existing studies on the distribution shift mostly adhere to adaptive normalization techniques for alleviating temporal mean and covariance shifts or time-variant modeling for capturing temporal shifts. Despite improving model generalization, these normalization-based methods often assume a time-invariant transition between outputs and inputs but disregard specific intra-/inter-series correlations, while time-variant models overlook the intrinsic causes of the distribution shift. This limits model expressiveness and interpretability of tackling the distribution shift for MTS forecasting. To mitigate such a dilemma, we present a unified Probabilistic Graphical Model to Jointly capturing intra-/inter-series correlations and modeling the time-variant transitional distribution, and instantiate a neural framework called JointPGM for non-stationary MTS forecasting. Specifically, JointPGM first employs multiple Fourier basis functions to learn dynamic time factors and designs two distinct learners: intra-series and inter-series learners. The intra-series learner effectively captures temporal dynamics by utilizing temporal gates, while the inter-series learner explicitly models spatial dynamics through multi-hop propagation, incorporating Gumbel-softmax sampling. These two types of series dynamics are subsequently fused into a latent variable, which is inversely employed to infer time factors, generate final prediction, and perform reconstruction. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of JointPGM through extensive experiments on six highly non-stationary MTS datasets, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance of MTS forecasting.">

        <tr id="Machine learning on graphs has recently found extensive applications across domains. However, the commonly used Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) suffer from limited expressive power and struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Graph transformers offer a strong alternative due to their global attention mechanism, but they come with great computational overheads, especially for large graphs. In recent years, State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a compelling approach to replace full attention in transformers to model sequential data. It blends the strengths of RNNs and CNNs, offering a) efficient computation, b) the ability to capture long-range dependencies, and c) good generalization across sequences of various lengths. However, extending SSMs to graph-structured data presents unique challenges due to the lack of canonical node ordering in graphs. In this work, we propose Graph State Space Convolution (GSSC) as a principled extension of SSMs to graph-structured data. By leveraging global permutation-equivariant set aggregation and factorizable graph kernels that rely on relative node distances as the convolution kernels, GSSC preserves all three advantages of SSMs. We demonstrate the provably stronger expressiveness of GSSC than MPNNs in counting graph substructures and show its effectiveness across 10 real-world, widely used benchmark datasets, where GSSC achieves best results on 7 out of 10 datasets with all significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art baselines and second-best results on the other 3 datasets. Our findings highlight the potential of GSSC as a powerful and scalable model for graph machine learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/GSSC.">

To harness the strengths of both domains in capturing local and global dependencies, we propose the Frequency and Time Domain Mixer (FTMixer).

Inspired by the windowing concept in frequency domain transformations, we present the Windowing Frequency Convolution (WFC) module to capture local dependencies. The WFC module first applies frequency transformation within each window, followed by convolution across windows. Furthermore, to better capture these local dependencies, we employ channel-independent scheme to mix the time domain and frequency domain patches. Notably, FTMixer employs the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) with real numbers instead of the complex-number-based Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), enabling direct utilization of modern deep learning operators in the frequency domain. Extensive experimental results across seven real-world long-term time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of FTMixer, in terms of both forecasting performance and computational efficiency.">

        <tr id="Tabular data is ubiquitous in many real-life systems. In particular, time-dependent tabular data, where rows are chronologically related, is typically used for recording historical events, e.g., financial transactions, healthcare records, or stock history. Recently, hierarchical variants of the attention mechanism of transformer architectures have been used to model tabular time-series data. At first, rows (or columns) are encoded separately by computing attention between their fields. Subsequently, encoded rows (or columns) are attended to one another to model the entire tabular time-series. While efficient, this approach constrains the attention granularity and limits its ability to learn patterns at the field-level across separate rows, or columns. We take a first step to address this gap by proposing Fieldy, a fine-grained hierarchical model that contextualizes fields at both the row and column levels. We compare our proposal against state of the art models on regression and classification tasks using public tabular time-series datasets. Our results show that combining row-wise and column-wise attention improves performance without increasing model size. Code and data are available at https://github.com/raphaaal/fieldy.">

Previously, forecasts in financial markets have been approached in two main ways: either as time-series problems over price sequence or sentiment analysis tasks. The sentiment analysis tasks aim to determine whether news events will have a positive or negative impact on stock prices, often categorizing them into discrete labels. Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to accurately model time series prediction, we propose a collaborative modeling framework that incorporates textual information about relevant events for predictions.

Extending graph pre-trained models to web-scale graphs with billions of nodes in industrial scenarios, while avoiding negative transfer across graphs or tasks, remains a challenge. We aim to develop a general graph pre-trained model with inductive ability that can make predictions for unseen new nodes and even new graphs. In this work, we introduce a scalable transformer-based graph pre-training framework called PGT (Pre-trained Graph Transformer). Specifically, we design a flexible and scalable graph transformer as the backbone network. Meanwhile, based on the masked autoencoder architecture, we design two pre-training tasks: one for reconstructing node features and the other one for reconstructing local structures. Unlike the original autoencoder architecture where the pre-trained decoder is discarded, we propose a novel strategy that utilizes the decoder for feature augmentation. We have deployed our framework on Tencent's online game data. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our framework can perform pre-training on real-world web-scale graphs with over 540 million nodes and 12 billion edges and generalizes effectively to unseen new graphs with different downstream tasks. We further conduct experiments on the publicly available ogbn-papers100M dataset, which consists of 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges.

Traditional time-series analysis approaches have fallen short in capturing the intricate interplay between these factors. Recent advancements have witnessed the incorporation of graph neural networks and machine learning techniques to bridge this gap, enhancing predictive accuracy and providing novel insights into disease spread mechanisms. Notable endeavors include leveraging human mobility data, employing transfer learning, and integrating advanced models such as Transformers and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to improve forecasting performance across diverse geographies for both influenza and COVID-19. However, these models often face challenges related to data quality, model transferability, and potential overfitting, highlighting the necessity for more adaptable and robust approaches. This paper introduces the Graph Attention-based Spatial Temporal (GAST) model, which employs graph attention networks (GATs) to overcome these limitations by providing a nuanced understanding of epidemic dynamics through a sophisticated spatio-temporal analysis framework. Our contributions include the development and validation of the GAST model, demonstrating its superior forecasting capabilities for influenza and COVID-19 spread, with a particular focus on short-term, daily predictions. The model’s application to both influenza and COVID-19 datasets showcases its versatility and potential to inform public health interventions across a range of infectious diseases.">

Conversely, graph transformers (GTs) enable information exchange between all nodes but oversimplify the graph structure by treating them as a set of fixed-length vectors. This work proposes a novel architecture, NeuralWalker, that overcomes the limitations of both methods by combining random walks with message passing. NeuralWalker achieves this by treating random walks as sequences, allowing for the application of recent advances in sequence models in order to capture long-range dependencies within these walks. Based on this concept, we propose a framework that offers (1) more expressive graph representations through random walk sequences, (2) the ability to utilize any sequence model for capturing long-range dependencies, and (3) the flexibility by integrating various GNN and GT architectures.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes ARC, a generalist GAD approach that enables a ``one-for-all'' GAD model to detect anomalies across various graph datasets on-the-fly. Equipped with in-context learning, ARC can directly extract dataset-specific patterns from the target dataset using few-shot normal samples at the inference stage, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning on the target dataset. ARC comprises three components that are well-crafted for capturing universal graph anomaly patterns: 1) smoothness-based feature Alignment module that unifies the features of different datasets into a common and anomaly-sensitive space; 2) ego-neighbor Residual graph encoder that learns abnormality-related node embeddings; and 3) cross-attentive in-Context anomaly scoring module that predicts node abnormality by leveraging few-shot normal samples. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets from various domains demonstrate the superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and generalizability of ARC.">

Traditional State Space Models (SSMs) are classical approaches for univariate time series modeling due to their simplicity and expressive power to represent linear dependencies. They, however, have fundamentally limited expressive power to capture non-linear dependencies, are slow in practice, and fail to model the inter-variate information flow. Despite recent attempts to improve the expressive power of SSMs by using deep structured SSMs, the existing methods are either limited to univariate time series, fail to model complex patterns (e.g., seasonal patterns), fail to dynamically model the dependencies of variate and time dimensions, and/or are input-independent. We present Chimera that uses two input-dependent 2-D SSM heads with different discretization processes to learn long-term progression and seasonal patterns. To improve the efficiency of complex 2D recurrence, we present a fast training using a new 2-dimensional parallel selective scan. We further present and discuss 2-dimensional Mamba and Mamba-2 as the spacial cases of our 2D SSM.

        <tr id="Continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) are essential for modeling interconnected, evolving systems. Traditional methods for extracting knowledge from these graphs often depend on feature engineering or deep learning. Feature engineering is limited by the manual and time-intensive nature of crafting features, while deep learning approaches suffer from high inference latency, making them impractical for real-time applications. This paper introduces Deep-Graph-Sprints (DGS), a novel deep learning architecture designed for efficient representation learning on CTDGs with low-latency inference requirements. We benchmark DGS against state-of-the-art feature engineering and graph neural network methods using five diverse datasets. The results indicate that DGS achieves competitive performance while improving inference speed up to 12x compared to other deep learning approaches on our tested benchmarks. Our method effectively bridges the gap between deep representation learning and low-latency application requirements for CTDGs.">

        <tr id="Existing approaches for learning representations of time-series keep the temporal arrangement of the time-steps intact with the presumption that the original order is the most optimal for learning. However, non-adjacent sections of real-world time-series may have strong dependencies. Accordingly we raise the question: Is there an alternative arrangement for time-series which could enable more effective representation learning? To address this, we propose a simple plug-and-play mechanism called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3) designed to improve time-series representation learning of existing models. S3 works by creating non-overlapping segments from the original sequence and shuffling them in a learned manner that is the most optimal for the task at hand. It then re-attaches the shuffled segments back together and performs a learned weighted sum with the original input to capture both the newly shuffled sequence along with the original sequence. S3 is modular and can be stacked to create various degrees of granularity, and can be added to many forms of neural architectures including CNNs or Transformers with negligible computation overhead. Through extensive experiments on several datasets and state-of-the-art baselines, we show that incorporating S3 results in significant improvements for the tasks of time-series classification and forecasting, improving performance on certain datasets by up to 68\%. We also show that S3 makes the learning more stable with a smoother training loss curve and loss landscape compared to the original baseline.

        <tr id="Key elements of human events are extracted as quadruples that consist of subject, relation, object, and timestamp. This representation can be extended to a quintuple by adding a fifth element: a textual summary that briefly describes the event. These quadruples or quintuples, when organized within a specific domain, form a temporal knowledge graph (TKG). Current learning frameworks focus on a few TKG-related tasks, such as predicting an object given a subject and a relation or forecasting the occurrences of multiple types of events (i.e., relation) in the next time window. They typically rely on complex structural and sequential models like graph neural networks (GNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to update intermediate embeddings. However, these methods often neglect the contextual information inherent in each quintuple, which can be effectively captured through concise textual descriptions. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can streamline the design of TKG learning frameworks while maintaining competitive accuracy in prediction and forecasting tasks. We develop multiple prompt templates to frame the object prediction (OP) task as a standard question-answering (QA) task, suitable for instruction fine-tuning with an encoder-decoder generative LLM. For multi-event forecasting (MEF), we design simple yet effective prompt templates for each TKG quintuple. This novel approach removes the need for GNNs and RNNs, instead utilizing an encoder-only LLM to generate fixed intermediate embeddings, which are subsequently processed by a prediction head with a self-attention mechanism to forecast potential future relations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets using various evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.">

        <tr id="Temporal graphs are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios, such as social network, trade and transportation. Predicting dynamic links between nodes in a temporal graph is of vital importance. Traditional methods usually leverage the temporal neighborhood of interaction history to generate node embeddings first and then aggregate the source and target node embeddings to predict the link. However, such methods focus on learning individual node representations, but overlook the pairwise representation learning nature of link prediction and fail to capture the important pairwise features of links such as common neighbors (CN). Motivated by the success of Neural Common Neighbor (NCN) for static graph link prediction, we propose TNCN, a temporal version of NCN for link prediction in temporal graphs. TNCN dynamically updates a temporal neighbor dictionary for each node, and utilizes multi-hop common neighbors between the source and target node to learn a more effective pairwise representation. We validate our model on five large-scale real-world datasets from the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB), and find that it achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three of them. Additionally, TNCN demonstrates excellent scalability on large datasets, outperforming popular GNN baselines by up to 6.4 times in speed. Our code is available at https: //github.com/GraphPKU/TNCN.">

Given a collection of observed temporal graphs, is it possible to predict the evolution of an unseen network from the same domain? To answer this question, we first present the Temporal Graph Scaling (TGS) dataset, a large collection of temporal graphs consisting of eighty-four ERC20 token transaction networks collected from 2017 to 2023. Next, we evaluate the transferability of Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) for the temporal graph property prediction task by pre-training on a collection of up to sixty-four token transaction networks and then evaluating the downstream performance on twenty unseen token networks. We find that the neural scaling law observed in NLP and Computer Vision also applies in temporal graph learning, where pre-training on greater number of networks leads to improved downstream performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of the transferability of temporal graphs learning. On downstream token networks, the largest pre-trained model outperforms single model TGNNs on thirteen unseen test networks. Therefore, we believe that this is a promising first step towards building foundation models for temporal graphs.">

However, training these models with the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss often results in over-smooth predictions, making it challenging to handle the complexity and learn high-entropy features from time series data with high variability and unpredictability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by tokenizing time series values to train forecasting models via cross-entropy loss, while considering the continuous nature of time series data. Specifically, we propose Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network, HCAN, a general model-agnostic component that can be integrated with any forecasting model. HCAN is based on a Hierarchy-Aware Attention module that integrates multi-granularity high-entropy features at different hierarchy levels. At each level, we assign a class label for timesteps to train an Uncertainty-Aware Classifier. This classifier mitigates the over-confidence in softmax loss via evidence theory. We also implement a Hierarchical Consistency Loss to maintain prediction consistency across hierarchy levels. Extensive experiments integrating HCAN with state-of-the-art forecasting models demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines on several real-world datasets.

        <tr id="Learning temporal dependencies among targets (TDT) benefits better time series forecasting, where targets refer to the predicted sequence. Although autoregressive methods model TDT recursively, they suffer from inefficient inference and error accumulation. We argue that integrating TDT learning into non-autoregressive methods is essential for pursuing effective and efficient time series forecasting. In this study, we introduce the differencing approach to represent TDT and propose a parameter-free and plug-and-play solution through an optimization objective, namely TDT Loss. It leverages the proportion of inconsistent signs between predicted and ground truth TDT as an adaptive weight, dynamically balancing target prediction and fine-grained TDT fitting. Importantly, TDT Loss incurs negligible additional cost, with only $\mathcal{O}(n)$ increased computation and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory requirements, while significantly enhancing the predictive performance of non-autoregressive models. To assess the effectiveness of TDT loss, we conduct extensive experiments on 7 widely used datasets. The experimental results of plugging TDT loss into 6 state-of-the-art methods show that out of the 168 experiments, 75.00\% and 94.05\% exhibit improvements in terms of MSE and MAE with the maximum 24.56\% and 16.31\%, respectively.">

        <tr id="Multivariate time series (MTS) data, when sampled irregularly and asynchronously, often present extensive missing values. Conventional methodologies for MTS analysis tend to rely on temporal embeddings based on timestamps that necessitate subsequent imputations, yet these imputed values frequently deviate substantially from their actual counterparts, thereby compromising prediction accuracy. Furthermore, these methods typically fail to provide robust initial embeddings for values infrequently observed or even absent within the training set, posing significant challenges to model generalizability. In response to these challenges, we propose SCAlable Numerical Embedding (SCANE), a novel framework that treats each feature value as an independent token, effectively bypassing the need for imputation. SCANE regularizes the traits of distinct feature embeddings and enhances representational learning through a scalable embedding mechanism. Coupling SCANE with the Transformer Encoder architecture, we develop the Scalable nUMerical eMbeddIng Transformer (SUMMIT), which is engineered to deliver precise predictive outputs for MTS characterized by prevalent missing entries. Our experimental validation, conducted across three disparate electronic health record (EHR) datasets marked by elevated missing value frequencies, confirms the superior performance of SUMMIT over contemporary state-of-the-art approaches addressing similar challenges. These results substantiate the efficacy of SCANE and SUMMIT, underscoring their potential applicability across a broad spectrum of MTS data analytical tasks.">

To bridge this gap, we introduce GLBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GraphLLM methods in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios. GLBench provides a fair and thorough evaluation of different categories of GraphLLM methods, along with traditional baselines such as graph neural networks. Through extensive experiments on a collection of real-world datasets with consistent data processing and splitting strategies, we have uncovered several key findings. Firstly, GraphLLM methods outperform traditional baselines in supervised settings, with LLM-as-enhancers showing the most robust performance. However, using LLMs as predictors is less effective and often leads to uncontrollable output issues. We also notice that no clear scaling laws exist for current GraphLLM methods. In addition, both structures and semantics are crucial for effective zero-shot transfer, and our proposed simple baseline can even outperform several models tailored for zero-shot scenarios.

To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose \textit{multi-view signature attention}, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.">

Despite significant advancements, existing models face notable challenges, including the necessity of manual hyperparameter tuning for different datasets, and difficulty in effectively distinguishing signal from redundant features in data characterized by strong seasonality. These issues hinder the generalization and practical application of time series forecasting models. To solve this issues, we propose an innovative time series forecasting model TimeSieve designed to address these challenges. Our approach employs wavelet transforms to preprocess time series data, effectively capturing multi-scale features without the need for additional parameters or manual hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we introduce the information bottleneck theory that filters out redundant features from both detail and approximation coefficients, retaining only the most predictive information. This combination reduces significantly improves the model's accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 70\% of the datasets, achieving higher predictive accuracy and better generalization across diverse datasets. Our results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the key challenges in time series forecasting, paving the way for more reliable and efficient predictive models in practical applications.

To address this problem, we propose to utilize the whole frequency spectrum to transform time series to make full use of data distribution from the frequency perspective. We present a deep frequency derivative learning framework, DERITS, for non-stationary time series forecasting. Specifically, DERITS is built upon a novel reversible transformation, namely Frequency Derivative Transformation (FDT) that makes signals derived in the frequency domain to acquire more stationary frequency representations. Then, we propose the Order-adaptive Fourier Convolution Network to conduct adaptive frequency filtering and learning. Furthermore, we organize DERITS as a parallel-stacked architecture for the multi-order derivation and fusion for forecasting.

        <tr id="Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due to the dynamic nature of time-series data, it is crucial to equip TSF models with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities, as historical training data and future test data can have different distributions. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the inherent OOD problem in TSF via invariant learning. We identify fundamental challenges of invariant learning for TSF. First, the target variables in TSF may not be sufficiently determined by the input due to unobserved core variables in TSF, breaking the conventional assumption of invariant learning. Second, time-series datasets lack adequate environment labels, while existing environmental inference methods are not suitable for TSF. To address these challenges, we propose FOIL, a model-agnostic framework that enables timeseries Forecasting for Out-of-distribution generalization via Invariant Learning. FOIL employs a novel surrogate loss to mitigate the impact of unobserved variables. Further, FOIL implements a joint optimization by alternately inferring environments effectively with a multi-head network while preserving the temporal adjacency structure, and learning invariant representations across inferred environments for OOD generalized TSF. We demonstrate that the proposed FOIL significantly improves the performance of various TSF models, achieving gains of up to 85%.">

The leading solutions in this domain are often associated with machine learning approaches. The drawback in many approaches is the missing interpretability of the lookback and the predicted time series.

Our approach aims to select and predict multiple patterns for the input series, based on continuous functions in a preselected bag of functions. Furthermore, stacking multiple encodings results in a continuous parameterization of the given dataset. The predicted bags are used to give precise forecasts and can unveil black box systems. Among synthetic as well as multiple industrial energy datasets we present competitive results in terms of performance, interpretability and pattern detection of the forecast as well as the given time series.

However, existing GNNs are often trained in a task-driven manner that fails to fully capture the intrinsic nature of the graph structure, resulting in sub-optimal node and graph representations.

GPL employs task-independent graph structure losses to encourage GNNs to learn intrinsic graph characteristics while simultaneously solving downstream tasks, producing higher-quality node and graph representations. In extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets, after being trained by GPL, GNNs significantly outperform their original performance on node classification, graph classification, and edge prediction tasks (up to 10.28%, 16.5%, and 24.15%, respectively). By allowing GNNs to capture the inherent structural prompts of graphs in GPL, they can alleviate the issue of over-smooth and achieve new state-of-the-art performances, which introduces a novel and effective direction for GNN research with potential applications in various domains.">

        <tr id="Anomaly detection of multivariate time series is critical in many applications. However, traditional statistical and machine learning models have limitations in modeling complex temporal dependencies and inter-sensor correlations. To address these limitations, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm and have shown promising progress in anomaly detection. However, most existing GNN-based methods simplify sensor associations as fully connected graphs, contradicting real-world sparse connectivity. Moreover, while capturing intersensor dependencies, GNNs often overlook critical temporal dependencies in time series. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised long- and short-term sparse graph attention (LSGA) neural network. Specifically, we first use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and skip-gate recurrent units (skip-GRUs) to extract local dependencies and long-term trends. Skip-GRU with time-skip connections effectively extends the span of information flow compared to traditional GRU. Due to the unknown graph structure between different sensors, we utilize node embedding to calculate the similarity between sensors and subsequently generate a dense similarity matrix. Then, we use the Gumbel-softmax sampling method to transform the similarity matrix into a sparse graph structure. To effectively fuse information from different sensors, we introduce a graph attention network (GAT), which can learn the relationships between sensors and dynamically fuse information based on the similarity of node embedding vectors. By means of sparse representation, we selectively focus on the information fusion of the sensors that have the greatest impact on themselves, thereby filtering out connections with low similarity between nodes and effectively removing redundant association information. Finally, we demonstrate with extensive experiments that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods in achieving better results on all four real datasets, improving average $F1$ by 0.97%, 7.7%, 1.92%, and 1.8%.">

        <tr id="Hierarchical time-series forecasting (HTSF) is an important problem for many real-world business applications where the goal is to simultaneously forecast multiple time-series that are related to each other via a hierarchical relation. Recent works, however, do not address two important challenges that are typically observed in many demand forecasting applications at large companies. First, many time-series at lower levels of the hierarchy have high sparsity i.e., they have a significant number of zeros. Most HTSF methods do not address this varying sparsity across the hierarchy. Further, they do not scale well to the large size of the real-world hierarchy typically unseen in benchmarks used in literature. We resolve both these challenges by proposing HAILS, a novel probabilistic hierarchical model that enables accurate and calibrated probabilistic forecasts across the hierarchy by adaptively modeling sparse and dense time-series with different distributional assumptions and reconciling them to adhere to hierarchical constraints. We show the scalability and effectiveness of our methods by evaluating them against real-world demand forecasting datasets. We deploy HAILS at a large chemical manufacturing company for a product demand forecasting application with over ten thousand products and observe a significant 8.5\% improvement in forecast accuracy and 23% better improvement for sparse time-series. The enhanced accuracy and scalability make HAILS a valuable tool for improved business planning and customer experience.">

Time series classification, the task of categorizing sequential data, has gained prominence, with machine learning approaches demonstrating remarkable performance on public benchmark datasets.

This work introduces a \textit{compositional representation learning} approach trained on statistically coherent components extracted from sequential data. Based on a multi-scale change space, an unsupervised approach is proposed to segment the sequential data into chunks with similar statistical properties. A sequence-based encoder model is trained in a multi-task setting to learn compositional representations from these temporal components for time series classification. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on publicly available time series classification benchmarks. Evaluating the coherence of segmented components shows its competitive performance on the unsupervised segmentation task.">

To address long-range dependencies, we introduce Continuous-Time Graph Anti-Symmetric Network (CTAN). Grounded within the ordinary differential equations framework, our method is designed for efficient propagation of information. In this paper, we show how CTAN's (i) long-range modeling capabilities are substantiated by theoretical findings and how (ii) its empirical performance on synthetic long-range benchmarks and real-world benchmarks is superior to other methods. Our results motivate CTAN's ability to propagate long-range information in C-TDGs as well as the inclusion of long-range tasks as part of temporal graph models evaluation.">

        <tr id="Demand prediction is a crucial task for e-commerce and physical retail businesses, especially during high-stake sales events. However, the limited availability of historical data from these peak periods poses a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages strategically chosen proxy data reflective of potential sales patterns from similar entities during non-peak periods, enriched by features learned from a graph neural networks (GNNs)-based forecasting model, to predict demand during peak events. We formulate the demand prediction as a meta-learning problem and develop the Feature-based First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (F-FOMAML) algorithm that leverages proxy data from non-peak periods and GNN-generated relational metadata to learn feature-specific layer parameters, thereby adapting to demand forecasts for peak events. Theoretically, we show that by considering domain similarities through task-specific metadata, our model achieves improved generalization, where the excess risk decreases as the number of training tasks increases. Empirical evaluations on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Compared to existing state-of-the-art models, our method demonstrates a notable improvement in demand prediction accuracy, reducing the Mean Absolute Error by 26.24% on an internal vending machine dataset and by 1.04% on the publicly accessible JD.com dataset.">

        <tr id="Time series is a typical data type in numerous domains; however, labeling large amounts of time series data can be costly and time-consuming. Learning effective representation from unlabeled time series data is a challenging task. Contrastive learning stands out as a promising method to acquire representations of unlabeled time series data. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised time-series representation learning framework via Time-Frequency Fusion Contrasting (TF-FC) to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. Specifically, TF-FC combines time-domain augmentation with frequency-domain augmentation to generate the diverse samples. For time-domain augmentation, the raw time series data pass through the time-domain augmentation bank (such as jitter, scaling, permutation, and masking) and get time-domain augmentation data. For frequency-domain augmentation, first, the raw time series undergoes conversion into frequency domain data following Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. Then, the frequency data passes through the frequency-domain augmentation bank (such as low pass filter, remove frequency, add frequency, and phase shift) and gets frequency-domain augmentation data. The fusion method of time-domain augmentation data and frequency-domain augmentation data is kernel PCA, which is useful for extracting nonlinear features in high-dimensional spaces. By capturing both the time and frequency domains of the time series, the proposed approach is able to extract more informative features from the data, enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish between different time series. To verify the effectiveness of the TF-FC method, we conducted experiments on four time series domain datasets (i.e., SleepEEG, HAR, Gesture, and Epilepsy). Experimental results show that TF-FC significantly improves in recognition accuracy compared with other SOTA methods.">

Initially, the approach utilizes bidirectional long short-term memory to capture information from both forward and backward directions in time series data. Subsequently, a multi-scale patch segmentation module generates various long sequences composed of equal-length segments, enabling the model to capture data patterns across multiple time scales by adjusting segment lengths. Finally, the local attention mechanism enhances feature extraction by accurately identifying and weighting important time segments, thereby strengthening the model’s understanding of the local features of the time series, followed by feature fusion. The model demonstrates outstanding performance in time series prediction tasks by effectively capturing sequence information across various time scales. Experimental validation illustrates the superior performance of BiLSTM-MLAM compared to six baseline methods across multiple datasets. When predicting the remaining life of aircraft engines, BiLSTM-MLAM outperforms the best baseline model by 6.66% in RMSE and 11.50% in MAE. In the LTE dataset, it achieves RMSE improvements of 12.77% and MAE enhancements of 3.06%, while in the load dataset, it demonstrates RMSE enhancements of 17.96% and MAE improvements of 30.39%. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the positive impact of each module on prediction accuracy.

These graphs can be represented through either a stream of edge events or a sequence of graph snapshots. Until now, the development of machine learning methods for both types has occurred largely in isolation, resulting in limited experimental comparison and theoretical crosspollination between the two. In this paper, we introduce Unified Temporal Graph (UTG), a framework that unifies snapshot-based and event-based machine learning models under a single umbrella, enabling models developed for one representation to be applied effectively to datasets of the other. We also propose a novel UTG training procedure to boost the performance of snapshot-based models in the streaming setting. We comprehensively evaluate both snapshot and event-based models across both types of temporal graphs on the temporal link prediction task. Our main findings are threefold: first, when combined with UTG training, snapshotbased models can perform competitively with event-based models such as TGN and GraphMixer even on event datasets. Second, snapshot-based models are at least an order of magnitude faster than most event-based models during inference. Third, while event-based methods such as NAT and DyGFormer outperforms snapshotbased methods on both types of temporal graphs, this is because they leverage joint neighborhood structural features thus emphasizing the potential to incorporate these features into snapshot-based models as well. These findings highlight the importance of comparing model architectures independent of the data format and suggest the potential of combining the efficiency of snapshot-based models with the performance of event-based models in the future.">

        <tr id="Stock prices, as an economic indicator, reflect changes in economic development and market conditions. Traditional stock price prediction models often only consider time-series data and are limited by the mechanisms of the models themselves. Some deep learning models have high computational costs, depend on a large amount of high-quality data, and have poor interpretations, making it difficult to intuitively understand the driving factors behind the predictions. Some studies have used deep learning models to extract text features and combine them with price data to make joint predictions, but there are issues with dealing with information noise, accurate extraction of text sentiment, and how to efficiently fuse text and numerical data. To address these issues in this paper, we propose a background-aware multi-source fusion financial trend forecasting mechanism. The system leverages a large language model to extract key information from policy and stock review texts, utilizing the MacBERT model to generate feature vectors. These vectors are then integrated with stock price data to form comprehensive feature representations. These integrated features are input into a neural network comprising various deep learning architectures. By integrating multiple data sources, the system offers a holistic view of market dynamics. It harnesses the comprehensive analytical and interpretative capabilities of large language models, retaining deep semantic and sentiment information from policy texts to provide richer input features for stock trend prediction. Additionally, we compare the accuracy of six models (LSTM, BiLSTM, MogrifierLSTM, GRU, ST-LSTM, SwinLSTM). The results demonstrate that our system achieves generally better accuracy in predicting stock movements, attributed to the incorporation of large language model processing, policy information, and other influential features.">

However, in many sequence modeling problems, the underlying process is inherently modular and it is of interest to have inductive biases that mimic this modular structure. In this paper, we introduce SlotSSMs, a novel framework for incorporating independent mechanisms into SSMs to preserve or encourage separation of information. Unlike conventional SSMs that maintain a monolithic state vector, SlotSSMs maintains the state as a collection of multiple vectors called slots. Crucially, the state transitions are performed independently per slot with sparse interactions across slots implemented via the bottleneck of self-attention. In experiments, we evaluate our model in object-centric video understanding, 3D visual reasoning, and video prediction tasks, which involve modeling multiple objects and their long-range temporal dependencies. We find that our proposed design offers substantial performance gains over existing sequence modeling methods.">

However, their applicability is constrained by the dependence on the observed graph structure. To solve this problem, Latent Graph Inference (LGI) is proposed to infer a task-specific latent structure by computing similarity or edge probability of node features and then apply a GNN to produce predictions. Even so, existing approaches neglect the noise from node features, which affects generated graph structure and performance. In this work, we introduce a novel method called Probability Passing to refine the generated graph structure by aggregating edge probabilities of neighboring nodes based on observed graph. Furthermore, we continue to utilize the LGI framework, inputting the refined graph structure and node features into GNNs to obtain predictions. We name the proposed scheme as Probability Passing-based Graph Neural Network (PPGNN). Moreover, the anchor-based technique is employed to reduce complexity and improve efficiency.

Network representation learning algorithms have demonstrated considerable effectiveness in various prediction tasks. However, most network representation learning algorithms are based on homogeneous networks and static networks for link prediction that do not consider rich semantic and dynamic information. Additionally, existing dynamic network representation learning methods neglect the neighborhood interaction structure of the node. In this work, we design a neighbor-enhanced dynamic heterogeneous attributed network embedding method (NeiDyHNE) for link prediction. In light of the impressive achievements of the heuristic methods, we learn the information of common neighbors and neighbors’ interaction in heterogeneous networks to preserve the neighbors proximity and common neighbors proximity. NeiDyHNE encodes the attributes and neighborhood structure of nodes as well as the evolutionary features of the dynamic network. More specifically, NeiDyHNE consists of the hierarchical structure attention module and the convolutional temporal attention module. The hierarchical structure attention module captures the rich features and semantic structure of nodes. The convolutional temporal attention module captures the evolutionary features of the network over time in dynamic heterogeneous networks. We evaluate our method and various baseline methods on the dynamic link prediction task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to baseline methods in terms of accuracy.">

However, traditional methods often struggle to capture the complex dynamics of meteorological systems, particularly in the presence of high-resolution data. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Attention Network (SFANet), a novel deep learning framework designed to address these challenges and enhance the accuracy of spatiotemporal weather prediction. Drawing inspiration from the limitations of existing methodologies, we present an innovative approach that seamlessly integrates advanced token mixing and attention mechanisms. By leveraging both pooling and spatial mixing strategies, SFANet optimizes the processing of high-dimensional spatiotemporal sequences, preserving inter-component relational information and modeling extensive long-range relationships. To further enhance feature integration, we introduce a novel spatial-frequency attention module, enabling the model to capture intricate cross-modal correlations. Our extensive experimental evaluation on two distinct datasets, the Storm EVent ImageRy (SEVIR) and the Institute for Climate and Application Research (ICAR) - El Ni\~{n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dataset, demonstrates the remarkable performance of SFANet.

LSTM captures both short-term and long-term trends and dependency in sequential data like time series data, as it contains specialized memory cells to store information in memory for longer periods. Existing traffic forecasting approaches lack features to forecast the traffic speed of interconnected road links and provide multivariate (i.e., multi-input and multi-output) and multi-step traffic forecasting both in the short- and long-term. We propose an Encoder-Decoder LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence architecture to capture the traffic speed of interconnected road links and provide multivariate multistep traffic forecasting both in the short-term (15 minutes) and long-term (two days). We apply a sliding-window approach to feed the short-term traffic forecasting as input to the model to project long-term traffic forecasting. Our model can incorporate multiple interconnected road links and providing traffic speed forecasting for multiple future steps. We conducted our experiment at an intersection in Oshawa, ON, Canada, and evaluated performance using the error distribution and Mean Absolute Error. The evaluation shows that the model can forecast traffic speed across interconnected road links with negligible error, both in the short-term and the long-term.">

        <tr id="Accurate evaluation of forecasting models is essential for ensuring reliable predictions. Current practices for evaluating and comparing forecasting models focus on summarising performance into a single score, using metrics such as SMAPE. We hypothesize that averaging performance over all samples dilutes relevant information about the relative performance of models. Particularly, conditions in which this relative performance is different than the overall accuracy. We address this limitation by proposing a novel framework for evaluating univariate time series forecasting models from multiple perspectives, such as one-step ahead forecasting versus multi-step ahead forecasting. We show the advantages of this framework by comparing a state-of-the-art deep learning approach with classical forecasting techniques. While classical methods (e.g. ARIMA) are long-standing approaches to forecasting, deep neural networks (e.g. NHITS) have recently shown state-of-the-art forecasting performance in benchmark datasets. We conducted extensive experiments that show NHITS generally performs best, but its superiority varies with forecasting conditions. For instance, concerning the forecasting horizon, NHITS only outperforms classical approaches for multi-step ahead forecasting. Another relevant insight is that, when dealing with anomalies, NHITS is outperformed by methods such as Theta. These findings highlight the importance of aspect-based model evaluation.">

While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40% in domains with rich textual data. More importantly, our datasets and library revolutionize broader applications, impacts, research topics to advance TSA.

Such node-level interactions do not process nodes as an ordered sequence, which would imply some kind of natural ordering of the nodes: they are said to be permutation invariant mechanisms. They are well suited for graph problems, but struggle at providing a global orchestration of the predicted links, which can result in a loss of performance. Some typical issues can be the difficulty to ensure high-level properties such as global connectedness, fixed diameter or to avoid information bottleneck effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, which respectively consist in abundant smoothing in dense areas leading to a loss of information and a tendency to exclude isolated nodes from the message passing scheme, and often result in irrelevant, unbalanced link predictions. To tackle this problem, we hereby present Cross-Attentive Modulation (CAM) tokens, which introduce cross-attentive units used to condition node and edge-level modulations in order to enable context-aware computations that improve the global consistency of the prediction links.

        <tr id="Urban crowd flow prediction is an important task for transportation systems and public safety. While graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely adopted for this task, existing GCN-based methods still face challenges. Firstly, they employ fixed receptive fields, failing to account for urban region heterogeneity where different functional zones interact distinctly with their surroundings. Secondly, they lack mechanisms to adaptively adjust spatial receptive fields based on temporal dynamics, which limits prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Receptive Field Graph Convolutional Network (ARFGCN) for urban crowd flow prediction. ARFGCN allows each region to independently determine its receptive field size, adaptively adjusted and learned in an end-to-end manner during training, enhancing model prediction performance. It comprises a time-aware adaptive receptive field (TARF) gating mechanism, a stacked 3DGCN, and a prediction layer. The TARF aims to leverage gating in neural networks to adapt receptive fields based on temporal dynamics, enabling the predictive network to adapt to urban regional heterogeneity. The TARF can be easily integrated into the stacked 3DGCN, enhancing the prediction. Experimental results demonstrate ARFGCN’s effectiveness compared to other methods.">

        <tr id="Implicit graph neural networks have gained popularity in recent years as they capture long-range dependencies while improving predictive performance in static graphs. Despite the tussle between performance degradation due to the oversmoothing of learned embeddings and long-range dependency being more pronounced in dynamic graphs, as features are aggregated both across neighborhood and time, no prior work has proposed an implicit graph neural model in a dynamic setting. In this paper, we present Implicit Dynamic Graph Neural Network (IDGNN) a novel implicit neural network for dynamic graphs which is the first of its kind. A key characteristic of IDGNN is that it demonstrably is well-posed, i.e., it is theoretically guaranteed to have a fixed-point representation. We then demonstrate that the standard iterative algorithm often used to train implicit models is computationally expensive in our dynamic setting as it involves computing gradients, which themselves have to be estimated in an iterative manner. To overcome this, we pose an equivalent bilevel optimization problem and propose an efficient single-loop training algorithm that avoids iterative computation by maintaining moving averages of key components of the gradients. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets on both classification and regression tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art baselines. We also demonstrate that our bi-level optimization framework maintains the performance of the expensive iterative algorithm while obtaining up to \textbf{1600x} speed-up.">

Existing datasets may not encompass the full range of statistical properties required for robust and comprehensive analysis. And privacy concerns can further limit their accessibility in domains such as finance and healthcare. This paper presents an approach that utilizes large language models and data source interfaces to explore and collect time series datasets. While obtained from external sources, the collected data share critical statistical properties with primary time series datasets, making it possible to model and adapt to various scenarios. This method enlarges the data quantity when the original data is limited or lacks essential properties. It suggests that collected datasets can effectively supplement existing datasets, especially involving changes in data distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the collected datasets through practical examples and show how time series forecasting foundation models fine-tuned on these datasets achieve comparable performance to those models without fine-tuning.">

        <tr id="Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) finds widespread applications across various domains such as financial markets, industrial production, and healthcare. Its primary objective is to learn the normal patterns of time series data, thereby identifying deviations in test samples. Most existing TSAD methods focus on modeling data from the temporal dimension, while ignoring the semantic information in the spatial dimension. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach, called Spatial-Temporal Normality learning (STEN). STEN is composed of a sequence Order prediction-based Temporal Normality learning (OTN) module that captures the temporal correlations within sequences, and a Distance prediction-based Spatial Normality learning (DSN) module that learns the relative spatial relations between sequences in a feature space. By synthesizing these two modules, STEN learns expressive spatial-temporal representations for the normal patterns hidden in the time series data. Extensive experiments on five popular TSAD benchmarks show that STEN substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/STEN.">

        <tr id="Despite the success of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) in modeling real-world Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), challenges such as expressiveness limitations and over-smoothing have prompted researchers to explore Graph Transformers (GTs) for enhanced HIN representation learning. However, research on GT in HINs remains limited, with two key shortcomings in existing work: (1) A node's neighbors at different distances in HINs convey diverse semantics. Unfortunately, existing methods ignore such differences and uniformly treat neighbors within a given distance in a coarse manner, which results in semantic confusion. (2) Nodes in HINs have various types, each with unique semantics. Nevertheless, existing methods mix nodes of different types during neighbor aggregation, hindering the capture of proper correlations between nodes of diverse types. To bridge these gaps, we design an innovative structure named (k,t)-ring neighborhood, where nodes are initially organized by their distance, forming different non-overlapping k-ring neighborhoods for each distance. Within each k-ring structure, nodes are further categorized into different groups according to their types, thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of both distances and types in HINs naturally. Based on this structure, we propose a novel Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HHGT) model, which seamlessly integrates a Type-level Transformer for aggregating nodes of different types within each k-ring neighborhood, followed by a Ring-level Transformer for aggregating different k-ring neighborhoods in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on downstream tasks to verify HHGT's superiority over 14 baselines, with a notable improvement of up to 24.75% in NMI and 29.25% in ARI for node clustering task on the ACM dataset compared to the best baseline.">

However, the reasoning capability of LLMs on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting. Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various input formats and retrieval augmented generation(RAG) modules. From extensive experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast, incorporating raw texts in specific complex events and fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance. Moreover, enhanced with retrieval modules, LLM can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. Meanwhile, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem still persist in LLMs, particularly in the RAG-based method. These findings not only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also highlight several promising research directions.We consider that this comprehensive evaluation, along with the identified research opportunities, will significantly contribute to future research on temporal event forecasting through LLMs.">

Imputation methods including Mean, Mode, Median, Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are compared across different deep learning architectures: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM Networks (Bi-LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Results indicate that the KNN imputation method consistently outperforms other techniques across all models, achieving lower MAPE (0.186) and RMSE (18.495) values. Furthermore, KNN-imputed models exhibit higher R2 values, indicating better model fit than other imputation methods. These findings underscore the importance of preprocessing in time-series forecasting and highlight the potential of KNN imputation to enhance predictive accuracy in real-world applications. Robust imputation strategies like KNN promise to improve forecasting accuracy and reliability, particularly in domains where accurate predictions are crucial for decision-making.

        <tr id="Dynamic graph learning equips the edges with time attributes and allows multiple links between two nodes, which is a crucial technology for understanding evolving data scenarios like traffic prediction and recommendation systems. Existing works obtain the evolving patterns mainly depending on the most recent neighbor sequences. However, we argue that whether two nodes will have interaction with each other in the future is highly correlated with the same interaction that happened in the past. Only considering the recent neighbors overlooks the phenomenon of repeat behavior and fails to accurately capture the temporal evolution of interactions. To fill this gap, this paper presents RepeatMixer, which considers evolving patterns of first and high-order repeat behavior in the neighbor sampling strategy and temporal information learning. Firstly, we define the first-order repeat-aware nodes of the source node as the destination nodes that have interacted historically and extend this concept to high orders as nodes in the destination node's high-order neighbors. Then, we extract neighbors of the source node that interacted before the appearance of repeat-aware nodes with a slide window strategy as its neighbor sequence. Next, we leverage both the first and high-order neighbor sequences of source and destination nodes to learn temporal patterns of interactions via an MLP-based encoder. Furthermore, considering the varying temporal patterns on different orders, we introduce a time-aware aggregation mechanism that adaptively aggregates the temporal representations from different orders based on the significance of their interaction time sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RepeatMixer over state-of-the-art models in link prediction tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed repeat-aware neighbor sampling strategy.">

        <tr id="Groundwater contamination induced by anthropogenic activities has long been a global issue. Characterizing and modeling contaminant transport processes is crucial to groundwater protection and management. However, challenges still exist in process complexity, data constraint, and computational cost. In the era of big data, the growth of machine learning has led to new opportunities in studying contaminant transport in groundwater systems. In this work, we introduce a new attention‐based graph neural network (aGNN) for modeling contaminant transport with limited monitoring data and quantifying causal connections between contaminant sources (drivers) and their spreading (outcomes). In five synthetic case studies that involve varying monitoring networks in heterogeneous aquifers, aGNN is shown to outperform LSTM‐based (long‐short term memory) and CNN‐ based (convolutional neural network) methods in multistep predictions (i.e., transductive learning). It also demonstrates a high level of applicability in inferring observations for unmonitored sites (i.e., inductive learning). Furthermore, an explanatory analysis based on aGNN quantifies the influence of each contaminant source, which has been validated by a physics‐based model with consistent outcomes with an R2 value exceeding 92%. The major advantage of aGNN is that it not only has a high level of predictive power in multiple scenario evaluations but also substantially reduces computational cost. Overall, this study shows that aGNN is efficient and robust for highly nonlinear spatiotemporal learning in subsurface contaminant transport, and provides a promising tool for groundwater management involving contaminant source attribution.">

        <tr id="Accurate traffic flow forecasting is a crucial research topic in transportation management. However, it is a challenging problem due to rapidly changing traffic conditions, high nonlinearity of traffic flow, and complex spatial and temporal correlations of road networks. Most existing studies either try to capture the spatial dependencies between roads using the same semantic graph over different time steps, or assume all sensors on the roads are equally likely to be connected regardless of the distance between them. However, we observe that the spatial dependencies between roads indeed change over time, and two distant roads are not likely to be helpful to each other when predicting the traffic flow, both of which limit the performance of existing studies. In this paper, we propose Temporal Graph Learning Recurrent Neural Network (TGLRN) to address these problems. More precisely, to effectively model the nature of time series, we leverage Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to dynamically construct a graph at each time step, thereby capturing the time-evolving spatial dependencies between roads (i.e., microscopic view). Simultaneously, we provide the Adaptive Structure Information to the model, ensuring that close and consecutive sensors are considered to be more important for predicting the traffic flow (i.e., macroscopic view). Furthermore, to endow TGLRN with robustness, we introduce an edge sampling strategy when constructing the graph at each time step, which eventually leads to further improvements on the model performance. Experimental results on four commonly used real-world benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of TGLRN.">

        <tr id="In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a potent tool for learning on graph-structured data and won fruitful successes in varied fields. The majority of GNNs follow the message-passing paradigm, where representations of each node are learned by recursively aggregating features of its neighbors. However, this mechanism brings severe over-smoothing and efficiency issues over high-degree graphs (HDGs), wherein most nodes have dozens (or even hundreds) of neighbors, such as social networks, transaction graphs, power grids, etc. Additionally, such graphs usually encompass rich and complex structure semantics, which are hard to capture merely by feature aggregations in GNNs. Motivated by the above limitations, we propose TADA, an efficient and effective front-mounted data augmentation framework for GNNs on HDGs. Under the hood, TADA includes two key modules: (i) feature expansion with structure embeddings, and (ii) topology- and attribute-aware graph sparsification. The former obtains augmented node features and enhanced model capacity by encoding the graph structure into high-quality structure embeddings with our highly-efficient sketching method. Further, by exploiting task-relevant features extracted from graph structures and attributes, the second module enables the accurate identification and reduction of numerous redundant/noisy edges from the input graph, thereby alleviating over-smoothing and facilitating faster feature aggregations over HDGs. Empirically, TADA considerably improves the predictive performance of mainstream GNN models on 8 real homophilic/heterophilic HDGs in terms of node classification, while achieving efficient training and inference processes.">

        <tr id="The accurate prediction of stock movements is crucial for investment strategies. Stock prices are subject to the influence of various forms of information, including financial indicators, sentiment analysis, news documents, and relational structures. Predominant analytical approaches, however, tend to address only unimodal or bimodal sources, neglecting the complexity of multimodal data. Further complicating the landscape are the issues of data sparsity and semantic conflicts between these modalities, which are frequently overlooked by current models, leading to unstable performance and limiting practical applicability. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a novel architecture, named Multimodal Stable Fusion with Gated Cross-Attention (MSGCA), designed to robustly integrate multimodal input for stock movement prediction. The MSGCA framework consists of three integral components: (1) a trimodal encoding module, responsible for processing indicator sequences, dynamic documents, and a relational graph, and standardizing their feature representations; (2) a cross-feature fusion module, where primary and consistent features guide the multimodal fusion of the three modalities via a pair of gated cross-attention networks; and (3) a prediction module, which refines the fused features through temporal and dimensional reduction to execute precise movement forecasting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the MSGCA framework exceeds current leading methods, achieving performance gains of 8.1%, 6.1%, 21.7% and 31.6% on four multimodal datasets, respectively, attributed to its enhanced multimodal fusion stability.">

Among the various applications, time series forecasting is of significant interest.

This study aimed to investigate a machine learning technique that utilizes multivariate features derived from CEEMD-decomposed time series data, leveraging a TFT predictor for multi-horizon forecasting. The application of this framework is demonstrated using a financial time series dataset, specifically the 14-day horizon forecast of the S&P 500 index. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach, revealing a substantial improvement (up to 33.72%) compared to similar TFT models utilizing closing prices, classical EMD, and EEMD approaches.

        <tr id="Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) have demonstrated their remarkable performance in modeling temporal interaction graphs. These works can generate temporal node representations by encoding the surrounding neighborhoods for the target node. However, an inherent limitation of existing TGNs is their reliance on fixed, hand-crafted rules for neighborhood encoding, overlooking the necessity for an adaptive and learnable neighborhood that can accommodate both personalization and temporal evolution across different timestamps. In this paper, we aim to enhance existing TGNs by introducing an adaptive neighborhood encoding mechanism. We present SEAN, a flexible plug-and-play model that can be seamlessly integrated with existing TGNs, effectively boosting their performance. To achieve this, we decompose the adaptive neighborhood encoding process into two phases: (i) representative neighbor selection, and (ii) temporal-aware neighborhood information aggregation. Specifically, we propose the Representative Neighbor Selector component, which automatically pinpoints the most important neighbors for the target node. It offers a tailored understanding of each node's unique surrounding context, facilitating personalization. Subsequently, we propose a Temporal-aware Aggregator, which synthesizes neighborhood aggregation by selectively determining the utilization of aggregation routes and decaying the outdated information, allowing our model to adaptively leverage both the contextually significant and current information during aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments by integrating SEAN into three representative TGNs, evaluating their performance on four public datasets and one financial benchmark dataset introduced in this paper. The results demonstrate that SEAN consistently leads to performance improvements across all models, achieving SOTA performance and exceptional robustness.">

To assess their efficacy, models are evaluated on publicly available benchmark datasets involving continuous-time and discrete-time temporal graphs. However, as we show in this work, the suitability of common batch-oriented evaluation depends on the datasets' characteristics, which can cause two issues: First, for continuous-time temporal graphs, fixed-size batches create time windows with different durations, resulting in an inconsistent dynamic link prediction task. Second, for discrete-time temporal graphs, the sequence of batches can additionally introduce temporal dependencies that are not present in the data. In this work, we empirically show that this common evaluation approach leads to skewed model performance and hinders the fair comparison of methods. We mitigate this problem by reformulating dynamic link prediction as a link forecasting task that better accounts for temporal information present in the data. We provide implementations of our new evaluation method for commonly used graph learning frameworks.">

        <tr id="Limited by the scale and diversity of time series data, the neural networks trained on time series data often overfit and show unsatisfacotry performances. In comparison, large language models (LLMs) recently exhibit impressive generalization in diverse fields. Although massive LLM based approaches are proposed for time series tasks, these methods require to load the whole LLM in both training and reference. This high computational demands limit practical applications in resource-constrained settings, like edge-computing and IoT devices. To address this issue, we propose Knowledge Pruning (KP), a novel paradigm for time series learning in this paper. For a specific downstream task, we argue that the world knowledge learned by LLMs is much redundant and only the related knowledge termed as"pertinent knowledge"is useful. Unlike other methods, our KP targets to prune the redundant knowledge and only distill the pertinent knowledge into the target model. This reduces model size and computational costs significantly. Additionally, different from existing LLM based approaches, our KP does not require to load the LLM in the process of training and testing, further easing computational burdens. With our proposed KP, a lightweight network can effectively learn the pertinent knowledge, achieving satisfactory performances with a low computation cost. To verify the effectiveness of our KP, two fundamental tasks on edge-computing devices are investigated in our experiments, where eight diverse environments or benchmarks with different networks are used to verify the generalization of our KP. Through experiments, our KP demonstrates effective learning of pertinent knowledge, achieving notable performance improvements in regression (19.7% on average) and classification (up to 13.7%) tasks, showcasing state-of-the-art results.">

This paper introduces a novel approach to the task of unilateral boundary time series forecasting. Our research bridges the gap in existing methods by proposing a specialized framework to accurately forecast within these skewed datasets. The cornerstone of our approach is the unilateral mean square error (UMSE), an asymmetric loss function that strategically addresses underestimation biases in training data, improving the precision of forecasts. We further enhance model performance through the implementation of a dual model structure that processes underestimated and accurately estimated data points separately, allowing for a nuanced analysis of the data trends. Additionally, feature reconstruction is employed to recapture obscured dynamics, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through extensive experimentation with LightGBM and GRU models across diverse datasets, showcasing superior accuracy and robustness in comparison to traditional models and existing methods. Our findings not only validate the efficacy of our approach but also reveal its model-independence and broad applicability.

Recently, some studies have exploited Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to impute/fill the missing values in multivariate time-series data. However, when faced with datasets with high missing rates, the imputation error of these methods increases dramatically. To this end, we propose a neural network model based on dynamic contribution and attention, denoted as ContrAttNet. ContrAttNet consists of three novel modules: feature attention module, iLSTM (imputation Long Short-Term Memory) module, and 1D-CNN (1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network) module. ContrAttNet exploits temporal information and spatial feature information to predict missing values, where iLSTM attenuates the memory of LSTM according to the characteristics of the missing values, to learn the contributions of different features. Moreover, the feature attention module introduces an attention mechanism based on contributions, to calculate supervised weights. Furthermore, under the influence of these supervised weights, 1D-CNN processes the time-series data by treating them as spatial features. Experimental results show that ContrAttNet outperforms other state-of-the-art models in the missing value imputation of multivariate time-series data, with average 6% MAPE and 9% MAE on the benchmark datasets.">

        <tr id="How to capture dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies remains an open question in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Although recent advanced spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) achieve superior forecasting performance, they either consider pre-defined spatial correlations or simply learn static graphs. Some research has tried to learn many adjacent matrices to reveal time-varying spatial correlations, but they generate discrete graphs which cannot encode evolutionary information and also face computational complexity problem. In this paper, we propose two significant plugins to help automatically learn enhanced dynamic spatial-temporal embedding of MTS data: (1) a novel neural conditional random field (CRF) layer. We find that the implicit time-varying spatial dependencies are reflected by the explicit changeable links between edges, and we propose the neural CRF to encode such pairwise changeable evolutionary inter-dependencies; (2) a structure adaptive graph convolution (SAGC) that does not require pre-defined graphs to capture semantically richer spatial correlations. Then, we integrate the neural CRF, SAGC with recurrent neural network to develop a new STGNN paradigm termed Adaptive Spatial-Temporal graph neural network with Conditional Random Field (ASTCRF), which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. We validate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of ASTCRF on five public benchmark MTS datasets.">

        <tr id="Time series generation is a crucial research topic in the area of deep learning, which can be used for data augmentation, imputing missing values, and forecasting. Currently, latent diffusion models are ascending to the forefront of generative modeling for many important data representations. Being the most pivotal in the computer vision domain, latent diffusion models have also recently attracted interest in other communities, including NLP, Speech, and Geometric Space. In this work, we propose TimeLDM, a novel latent diffusion model for high-quality time series generation. TimeLDM is composed of a variational autoencoder that encodes time series into an informative and smoothed latent content and a latent diffusion model operating in the latent space to generate latent information. We evaluate the ability of our method to generate synthetic time series with simulated and realistic datasets, benchmark the performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed TimeLDM persistently delivers high-quality generated time series. Sores from Context-FID and Discriminative indicate that TimeLDM consistently and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art benchmarks with an average improvement of 3.4$\times$ and 3.8$\times$, respectively. Further studies demonstrate that our method presents better performance on different lengths of time series data generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the potential of the latent diffusion model for unconditional time series generation and establish a new baseline for synthetic time series.">

However, when detecting anomalies, the representations of abnormal nodes are prone to be averaged by normal neighbors, making the learned anomaly representations less distinguishable. To tackle this issue, we propose CAGAD -- an unsupervised Counterfactual data Augmentation method for Graph Anomaly Detection -- which introduces a graph pointer neural network as the heterophilic node detector to identify potential anomalies whose neighborhoods are normal-node-dominant. For each identified potential anomaly, we design a graph-specific diffusion model to translate a part of its neighbors, which are probably normal, into anomalous ones. At last, we involve these translated neighbors in GNN neighborhood aggregation to produce counterfactual representations of anomalies. Through aggregating the translated anomalous neighbors, counterfactual representations become more distinguishable and further advocate detection performance. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that CAGAD significantly outperforms strong baselines, with an average improvement of 2.35% on F1, 2.53% on AUC-ROC, and 2.79% on AUC-PR.">

In practice, temporal graphs are formalized as an ordered sequence of static graph snapshots observed at discrete time points. Sequence models such as RNNs or Transformers have long been the predominant backbone networks for modeling such temporal graphs. Yet, despite the promising results, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models (SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying continuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention and achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In this work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to temporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online approximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term. The emergent continuous-time system introduces novel algorithmic challenges, thereby necessitating our development of GraphSSM, a graph state space model for modeling the dynamics of temporal graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphSSM framework across various temporal graph benchmarks.">

The growing interest in precipitation nowcasting offers substantial opportunities for the advancement of current forecasting technologies. Nevertheless, there has been a scarcity of in-depth surveys of time series precipitation forecasting using deep learning. Thus, this paper systemically reviews recent progress in time series precipitation forecasting models. Specifically, we investigate the following key points within background components, covering: i) preprocessing, ii) objective functions, and iii) evaluation metrics. We then categorize forecasting models into \textit{recursive} and \textit{multiple} strategies based on their approaches to predict future frames, investigate the impacts of models using the strategies, and performance assessments. Finally, we evaluate current deep learning-based models for precipitation forecasting on a public benchmark, discuss their limitations and challenges, and present some promising research directions. Our contribution lies in providing insights for a better understanding of time series precipitation forecasting and in aiding the development of robust AI solutions for the future.">

This behavior, known as in-context learning, allows for performing nontrivial machine learning tasks during inference only. In this work, we address the question: can we leverage in-context learning to predict out-of-distribution materials properties? However, this would not be possible for structure property prediction tasks unless an effective method is found to pass atomic-level geometric features to the transformer model. To address this problem, we employ a compound model in which GPT-2 acts on the output of geometry-aware graph neural networks to adapt in-context information. To demonstrate our model's capabilities, we partition the QM9 dataset into sequences of molecules that share a common substructure and use them for in-context learning. This approach significantly improves the performance of the model on out-of-distribution examples, surpassing the one of general graph neural network models.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based methods have recently demonstrated their potential in time series forecasting problems. However, the mainstream approach, primarily utilizing attention to model inter-step correlation in the time domain, is constrained by two significant issues that lead to ineffective and inefficient multivariate forecasting. The first is that key representations in the time domain are scattered and sparse, resulting in parameter bloat and increased difficulty in capturing time dependencies. The second is that treating time step points as uniformly embedded tokens leads to the erasure of inter-variate correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a frequency-wise and variables-oriented transformer-based method. This method leverages the intrinsic conjugate symmetry in the frequency domain, enabling compact frequency domain representations that naturally mix information across time points while reducing spatio-temporal costs. Multivariate inter-correlations can also be captured from similar frequency domain components, which enhances the variables-oriented attention mechanism modeling capability. Further, we employ both polar and complex domain perspectives to enrich the frequency domain representations and decode complicated temporal patterns. We propose frequency-enhanced independent representation multi-head attention (FIR-Attention) to leverage these advantages for improved multivariate interaction. Techniques such as cutting-off frequency and equivalent mapping are used to ensure the model’s lightweight nature. Extensive experiments on eight mainstream datasets show that our approach achieves first-rate satisfactory results and, importantly, requires only one percent of the spatio-temporal cost of mainstream methods.">

        <tr id="Modern recurrent layers are emerging as a promising path toward edge deployment of foundation models, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs). Compressing the whole input sequence in a finite-dimensional representation enables recurrent layers to model long-range dependencies while maintaining a constant inference cost for each token and a fixed memory requirement. However, the practical deployment of LLMs in resource-limited environments often requires further model compression, such as quantization and pruning. While these techniques are well-established for attention-based models, their effects on recurrent layers remain underexplored. In this preliminary work, we focus on post-training quantization for recurrent LLMs and show that Mamba models exhibit the same pattern of outlier channels observed in attention-based LLMs. We show that the reason for the difficulty of quantizing SSMs is caused by activation outliers, similar to those observed in transformer-based LLMs. We report baseline results for post-training quantization of Mamba that do not take into account the activation outliers and suggest first steps for outlier-aware quantization.">

        <tr id="Foundation models that can perform inference on any new task without requiring specific training have revolutionized machine learning in vision and language applications. However, applications involving graph-structured data remain a tough nut for foundation models, due to challenges in the unique feature- and label spaces associated with each graph. Traditional graph ML models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on graphs cannot perform inference on a new graph with feature and label spaces different from the training ones. Furthermore, existing models learn functions specific to the training graph and cannot generalize to new graphs. In this work, we tackle these two challenges with a new foundational architecture for inductive node classification named GraphAny. GraphAny models inference on a new graph as an analytical solution to a LinearGNN, thereby solving the first challenge. To solve the second challenge, we learn attention scores for each node to fuse the predictions of multiple LinearGNNs. Specifically, the attention module is carefully parameterized as a function of the entropy-normalized distance-features between multiple LinearGNNs predictions to ensure generalization to new graphs. Empirically, GraphAny trained on the Wisconsin dataset with only 120 labeled nodes can effectively generalize to 30 new graphs with an average accuracy of 67.26\% in an inductive manner, surpassing GCN and GAT trained in the supervised regime, as well as other inductive baselines.">

This study proposes a multi-scale graph wavelet temporal convolution network (MSGWTCN) to predict the traffic states in complex transportation networks. Specifically, a multi-scale spatial block is designed to simultaneously capture the spatial information at different levels, and the gated temporal convolution network is employed to extract the temporal dependencies of the data. The model jointly learns to mount multiple levels of the spatial interactions by stacking graph wavelets with different scales. Two real-world datasets are used in this study to investigate the model performance, including a highway network in Seattle and a dense road network of Manhattan in New York City. Experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models. Furthermore, different scales of graph wavelets are found to be effective in extracting local, intermediate and global information at the same time and thus enable the model to learn a complex transportation network topology with various types of road segments. By carefully customizing the scales of wavelets, the model is able to improve the prediction performance and better adapt to different network configurations.">

        <tr id="The modelling of temporal patterns in dynamic graphs is an important current research issue in the development of time-aware GNNs. Whether or not a specific sequence of events in a temporal graph constitutes a temporal pattern not only depends on the frequency of its occurrence. We consider whether it deviates from what is expected in a temporal graph where timestamps are randomly shuffled. While accounting for such a random baseline is important to model temporal patterns, it has mostly been ignored by current temporal graph neural networks. To address this issue we propose HYPA-DBGNN, a novel two-step approach that combines (i) the inference of anomalous sequential patterns in time series data on graphs based on a statistically principled null model, with (ii) a neural message passing approach that utilizes a higher-order De Bruijn graph whose edges capture overrepresented sequential patterns. Our method leverages hypergeometric graph ensembles to identify anomalous edges within both first- and higher-order De Bruijn graphs, which encode the temporal ordering of events. The model introduces an inductive bias that enhances model interpretability. We evaluate our approach for static node classification using benchmark datasets and a synthetic dataset that showcases its ability to incorporate the observed inductive bias regarding over- and under-represented temporal edges. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in detecting similar patterns within empirical datasets, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods in node classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce statistically informed GNNs that leverage temporal and causal sequence anomalies. HYPA-DBGNN represents a path for bridging the gap between statistical graph inference and neural graph representation learning, with potential applications to static GNNs.">

Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future works.\footnote{Codes for our experiments will be made public at: \url{https://github.com/JingzheShi/ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting}.">

A reliable structure promotes obtaining more cohesive node representations, while high-quality node representations can guide the augmentation of the structure, enhancing structural reliability in return. Moreover, the generalization ability of existing GNNs-based models is relatively poor. While they perform well on graphs with high homogeneity, they perform poorly on graphs with low homogeneity. To this end, we propose a graph clustering framework named Synergistic Deep Graph Clustering Network (SynC). In our approach, we design a Transform Input Graph Auto-Encoder (TIGAE) to obtain high-quality embeddings for guiding structure augmentation. Then, we re-capture neighborhood representations on the augmented graph to obtain clustering-friendly embeddings and conduct self-supervised clustering. Notably, representation learning and structure augmentation share weights, significantly reducing the number of model parameters. Additionally, we introduce a structure fine-tuning strategy to improve the model's generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. The code is released on GitHub and Code Ocean.">

        <tr id="Recurrent neural network-based sequence-to-sequence models have been extensively applied for multi-step-ahead time series forecasting. These models typically involve a decoder trained using either its previous forecasts or the actual observed values as the decoder inputs. However, relying on self-generated predictions can lead to the rapid accumulation of errors over multiple steps, while using the actual observations introduces exposure bias as these values are unavailable during the extrapolation stage. In this regard, this study proposes a novel training approach called reinforced decoder, which introduces auxiliary models to generate alternative decoder inputs that remain accessible when extrapolating. Additionally, a reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to dynamically select the optimal inputs to improve accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms representative training methods over several datasets. Furthermore, the proposed approach also exhibits promising performance when generalized to self-attention-based sequence-to-sequence forecasting models.">

This paper investigates a new research task: self-interpretable GNNs for CTDGs. We aim to predict future links within the dynamic graph while simultaneously providing causal explanations for these predictions. There are two key challenges: (1) capturing the underlying structural and temporal information that remains consistent across both independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and (2) efficiently generating high-quality link prediction results and explanations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel causal inference model, namely the Independent and Confounded Causal Model (ICCM).

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) can learn effective node representations that significantly improve link prediction accuracy. However, most GNN-based link prediction algorithms are incompetent to predict weak ties connecting different communities. Most link prediction algorithms are designed for networks with only one type of relation between nodes but neglect the fact that many complex systems, including transportation and social networks, consisting of multi-modalities of interactions that correspond to different nature of interactions and dynamics that can be modeled as multiplex network, where different types of relation are represented in different layers. This paper proposes a Multi-Relations-aware Graph Neural Network (MRGNN) framework to learn effective node representations for multiplex networks and make more accurate link predictions, especially for weak ties. Specifically, our model utilizes an intra-layer node-level feature propagation process and an inter-layer representation merge process, which applies a simple yet effective logistic or semantic attention voting mechanism to adaptively aggregate information from different layers. Extensive experiments on four diversified multiplex networks show that MRGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art multiplex link prediction algorithms on overall prediction accuracy, and works pretty well on forecasting weak ties">

Traffic flow parameters are volatile and uncertain, making traffic flow forecasting a difficult task if the appropriate forecasting model is not used. Additionally, the non-Euclidean data structure of traffic flow parameters is challenging to analyze from both spatial and temporal perspectives. State-of-the-art deep learning approaches use pure convolution, recurrent neural networks, and hybrid methods to achieve this objective efficiently. However, many of the approaches in the literature rely on complex architectures that can be difficult to train. This complexity also adds to the black-box nature of deep learning. This study introduces a novel deep learning architecture, referred to as the multigraph convolution neural network (MGCNN), for turning movement prediction at intersections. The proposed architecture combines a multigraph structure, built to model temporal variations in traffic data, with a spectral convolution operation to support modeling the spatial variations in traffic data over the graphs. The proposed model was tested using twenty days of flow and traffic control data collected from an arterial in downtown Chattanooga, TN, with ten signalized intersections. The model's ability to perform short-term predictions over 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes into the future was evaluated against four baseline state-of-the-art models.

The accuracy of prediction models is influenced by various factors, including nonlinearity, seasonality, and economic shocks. Deep learning has demonstrated better forecasts of stock prices than traditional approaches. This study, therefore, proposed a new approach to improve forecasting system based on an end-to-end convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with attention mechanism. Our approach first investigates local stock price features using 1D convolutional neural network, and then employs a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network for forecasting. This model stands out by effectively utilizing contextual data and representing the temporal character of data. The Bi-LSTM is helpful for understanding the history and future contextual information since it uncovers both past and future contexts of stock data. Furthermore, integrating attention mechanism within the CRNN represents a significant improvement. This allows our model to handle long input sequences more effectively and capture the inherent stochasticity in stock prices, which is often missed by traditional models. The effectiveness of our approach is investigated using data on 10 stock indexes from Yahoo Finance. The results show that our method outperforms ARIMA, LSTM, and conventional methods. ">

In the structure, a k-nearest neighbors feature graph is pre-built based on the similarities between nodes and combine it with the original topological graph as input to the parameter-shared residual graph convolutional module to extract common information. Additionally, an attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust the weights of different embeddings, enabling comprehensive fusion of feature information.

While SFDA is prevalent in computer vision, it remains largely unexplored in time series analysis. Existing SFDA methods, designed for visual data, struggle to capture the inherent temporal dynamics of time series, hindering adaptation performance. This paper proposes MAsk And imPUte (MAPU), a novel and effective approach for time series SFDA. MAPU addresses the critical challenge of temporal consistency by introducing a novel temporal imputation task. This task involves randomly masking time series signals and leveraging a dedicated temporal imputer to recover the original signal within the learned embedding space, bypassing the complexities of noisy raw data. Notably, MAPU is the first method to explicitly address temporal consistency in the context of time series SFDA. Additionally, it offers seamless integration with existing SFDA methods, providing greater flexibility. We further introduce E-MAPU, which incorporates evidential uncertainty estimation to address the overconfidence issue inherent in softmax predictions. To achieve that, we leverage evidential deep learning to obtain a better-calibrated pre-trained model and adapt the target encoder to map out-of-support target samples to a new feature representation closer to the source domain's support. This fosters better alignment, ultimately enhancing adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world time series datasets demonstrate that both MAPU and E-MAPU achieve significant performance gains compared to existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approaches for tackling various time series domain adaptation problems.">

This issue is further exacerbated by the lack of a comprehensive and accessible benchmark. Furthermore, a common need in practical applications is what-if analysis and dynamic adaptation to data distribution changes, for usage in decision making and to manage a changing world: What if this road is temporarily blocked or another road is added? The focus of this paper is on mobility data, such as people's movement in cities, requiring all these issues to be addressed. To this end, we propose a transformer-based diffusion model, TDDPM, for time-series which outperforms and scales substantially better than state-of-the-art. This is evaluated in a new comprehensive benchmark across several sequence lengths, standard datasets, and evaluation measures. We also demonstrate how the model can be conditioned on a prior over spatial occupancy frequency information, allowing the model to generate mobility data for previously unseen environments and for hypothetical scenarios where the underlying road network and its usage changes. This is evaluated by training on mobility data from part of a city. Then, using only aggregate spatial information as prior, we demonstrate out-of-distribution generalization to the unobserved remainder of the city.">

Not limited to text and images, generative models can generate industrial time series data, addressing challenges such as the difficulty of data collection and data annotation. Due to their outstanding generation ability, they have been widely used in Internet of Things, metaverse, and cyber-physical-social systems to enhance the efficiency of industrial production. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of generative models for industrial time series from deep generative models (DGMs) to large generative models (LGMs). First, a DGM-based AIGC framework is proposed for industrial time series generation. Within this framework, we survey advanced industrial DGMs and present a multi-perspective categorization. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the critical technologies required to construct industrial LGMs from four aspects: large-scale industrial dataset, LGMs architecture for complex industrial characteristics, self-supervised training for industrial time series, and fine-tuning of industrial downstream tasks. Finally, we conclude the challenges and future directions to enable the development of generative models in industry.">

While there has been substantial progress in flexible neural network-based post-processing methods over the past years, most station-based approaches still treat every input data point separately which limits the capabilities for leveraging spatial structures in the forecast errors. In order to improve information sharing across locations, we propose a graph neural network architecture for ensemble post-processing, which represents the station locations as nodes on a graph and utilizes an attention mechanism to identify relevant predictive information from neighboring locations. In a case study on 2-m temperature forecasts over Europe, the graph neural network model shows substantial improvements over a highly competitive neural network-based post-processing method.">

The evolution of deep learning methods for time series prediction has progressed from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to the recently popularized Transformer network. However, each of these methods has encountered specific issues. Recent studies have questioned the effectiveness of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers for time series prediction, prompting a reevaluation of approaches to LTSF (Long Time Series Forecasting) problems. To circumvent the limitations present in current models, this paper introduces a novel hybrid network, Temporal Convolutional Network-Linear (TCN-Linear), which leverages the temporal prediction capabilities of the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to enhance the capacity of LSTF-Linear. Time series from three classical chaotic systems (Lorenz, Mackey–Glass, and Rossler) and real-world stock data serve as experimental datasets. Numerical simulation results indicate that, compared to classical networks and novel hybrid models, our model achieves the lowest RMSE, MAE, and MSE with the fewest training parameters, and its R2 value is the closest to 1.">

Stemmed from the node-wise representations of GNNs, existing explanation studies have embraced the subgraph-specific viewpoint that attributes the decision results to the salient features and local structures of nodes. However, graph-level tasks necessitate long-range dependencies and global interactions for advanced GNNs, deviating significantly from subgraph-specific explanations. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel intrinsically interpretable scheme for graph classification, termed as Global Interactive Pattern (GIP) learning, which introduces learnable global interactive patterns to explicitly interpret decisions. GIP first tackles the complexity of interpretation by clustering numerous nodes using a constrained graph clustering module. Then, it matches the coarsened global interactive instance with a batch of self-interpretable graph prototypes, thereby facilitating a transparent graph-level reasoning process. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GIP yields significantly superior interpretability and competitive performance to~the state-of-the-art counterparts.

In view of this, we propose a transformer-based hierarchical feature guided network (HGNET), which can efficiently extract features of agents and map information from visual and vectorized inputs, modeling multimodal interaction relationships. Second, we design the Feature-Guided Attention (FGAT) module to leverage the potential guiding effects between different prediction targets, thereby improving prediction accuracy. Additionally, to enhance the temporal consistency and causal relationships of the predictions, we propose a Time Series Memory framework to learn the conditional distribution models of the prediction outputs at future time steps from multivariate time series.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.">

        <tr id="Self-supervised contrastive learning has become a key technique in deep learning, particularly in time series analysis, due to its ability to learn meaningful representations without explicit supervision. Augmentation is a critical component in contrastive learning, where different augmentations can dramatically impact performance, sometimes influencing accuracy by over 30%. However, the selection of augmentations is predominantly empirical which can be suboptimal, or grid searching that is time-consuming. In this paper, we establish a principled framework for selecting augmentations based on dataset characteristics such as trend and seasonality. Specifically, we construct 12 synthetic datasets incorporating trend, seasonality, and integration weights. We then evaluate the effectiveness of 8 different augmentations across these synthetic datasets, thereby inducing generalizable associations between time series characteristics and augmentation efficiency. Additionally, we evaluated the induced associations across 6 real-world datasets encompassing domains such as activity recognition, disease diagnosis, traffic monitoring, electricity usage, mechanical fault prognosis, and finance. These real-world datasets are diverse, covering a range from 1 to 12 channels, 2 to 10 classes, sequence lengths of 14 to 1280, and data frequencies from 250 Hz to daily intervals. The experimental results show that our proposed trend-seasonality-based augmentation recommendation algorithm can accurately identify the effective augmentations for a given time series dataset, achieving an average Recall@3 of 0.667, outperforming baselines. Our work provides guidance for studies employing contrastive learning in time series analysis, with wide-ranging applications.

Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to existing approaches.">

This phenomenon leads to the oversmoothing problem that hampers downstream graph analytics tasks. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel and flexible truss-based graph sparsification model that prunes edges from dense regions of the graph. Pruning redundant edges in dense regions helps to prevent the aggregation of excessive neighborhood information during hierarchical message passing and pooling in GNN models.

In this work, we propose a novel method to detect the periodicity in time series without the need for any labels or requiring tailored positive or negative data generation mechanisms with specific augmentations.

The phase space reconstruction method can effectively retain the chaotic characteristics of power load from a system dynamics perspective and thus is a promising knowledge-based preprocessing method for power load forecasting. However, limited by its fundamental theory, there is still a gap in implementing a multi-step forecasting scheme in current studies. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a novel multi-step forecasting approach by integrating the PSR with neural networks. Firstly, the useful features in the phase trajectory obtained from the preprocessing of PSR are discussed in detail. Through mathematical derivation, the equivalent characterization of the PSR and another time series preprocessing method, patch segmentation, is demonstrated for the first time. Based on this prior knowledge, an image-based modeling perspective with the global and local feature extraction strategy is introduced. Subsequently, a novel deep learning model, namely PSR-GALIEN, is designed for end-to-end processing, in which the Transformer Encoder and 2D-convolutional neural networks are employed for the extraction of the global and local patterns in the image, and a multi-layer perception based predictor is used for the efficient correlation modeling. Then, extensive experiments are conducted on five real-world benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness as well as to have an insight into the detailed properties. The results show that, comparing it with six state-of-the-art deep learning models, the forecasting performance of PSR-GALIEN consistently surpasses these baselines, which achieves superior accuracy in both intra-day and day-ahead forecasting scenarios. At the same time, a visualization-based method is proposed to explain the attributions of the forecasting results.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have suggested frequency-domain Data augmentation (DA) is effec tive for time series prediction. Existing frequency-domain augmentations disturb the original data with various full-spectrum noises, leading to excess domain gap between augmented and original data. Although impressive performance has been achieved in certain cases, frequency-domain DA has yet to be generalized to time series prediction datasets. In this paper, we found that frequency-domain augmentations can be significantly improved by two modifications that limit the perturbations. First, we found that limiting the perturbation to only dominant frequencies significantly outperforms full-spectrum perturbations. Dominant fre quencies represent the main periodicity and trends of the signal and are more important than other frequencies. Second, we found that simply shuffling the dominant frequency components is superior over sophisticated designed random perturbations. Shuffle rearranges the original components (magnitudes and phases) and limits the external noise. With these two modifications, we proposed dominant shuffle, a simple yet effective data augmentation for time series prediction. Our method is very simple yet powerful and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. Extensive experiments with eight datasets and six popular time series models demonstrate that our method consistently improves the baseline performance under various settings and significantly outperforms other DA methods.

We derive a closed-form solution for multi-task optimization in the context of linear models. Our analysis provides valuable insights by linking the multi-task learning performance to various model statistics such as raw data covariances, signal-generating hyperplanes, noise levels, as well as the size and number of datasets.

Conversely, we prove that a suitable loss function on the stochastic model outputs simultaneously grants (i) the unknown adjacency matrix latent distribution and (ii) optimal performance on the prediction task.

        <tr id="Transformer-based and MLP-based methods have emerged as leading approaches in time series forecasting (TSF). While Transformer-based methods excel in capturing long-range dependencies, they suffer from high computational complexities and tend to overfit. Conversely, MLP-based methods offer computational efficiency and adeptness in modeling temporal dynamics, but they struggle with capturing complex temporal patterns effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MLP-based Adaptive Multi-Scale Decomposition (AMD) framework for TSF. Our framework decomposes time series into distinct temporal patterns at multiple scales, leveraging the Multi-Scale Decomposable Mixing (MDM) block to dissect and aggregate these patterns in a residual manner. Complemented by the Dual Dependency Interaction (DDI) block and the Adaptive Multi-predictor Synthesis (AMS) block, our approach effectively models both temporal and channel dependencies and utilizes autocorrelation to refine multi-scale data integration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our AMD framework not only overcomes the limitations of existing methods but also consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks across various datasets, showcasing superior efficiency.

        <tr id="Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are Graph Neural Networks where the convolutions are applied over a graph. In contrast to Convolutional Neural Networks, GCN's are designed to perform inference on graphs, where the number of nodes can vary, and the nodes are unordered. In this study, we address two important challenges related to GCNs: i) oversmoothing; and ii) the utilization of node relational properties (i.e., heterophily and homophily). Oversmoothing is the degradation of the discriminative capacity of nodes as a result of repeated aggregations. Heterophily is the tendency for nodes of different classes to connect, whereas homophily is the tendency of similar nodes to connect. We propose a new strategy for addressing these challenges in GCNs based on Transfer Entropy (TE), which measures of the amount of directed transfer of information between two time varying nodes. Our findings indicate that using node heterophily and degree information as a node selection mechanism, along with feature-based TE calculations, enhances accuracy across various GCN models. Our model can be easily modified to improve classification accuracy of a GCN model. As a trade off, this performance boost comes with a significant computational overhead when the TE is computed for many graph nodes.">

        <tr id="Forecasting multivariate time series is a computationally intensive task challenged by extreme or redundant samples. Recent resampling methods aim to increase training efficiency by reweighting samples based on their running losses. However, these methods do not solve the problems caused by heavy-tailed distribution losses, such as overfitting to outliers. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel approach: a Gaussian loss-weighted sampler that multiplies their running losses with a Gaussian distribution weight. It reduces the probability of selecting samples with very low or very high losses while favoring those close to average losses. As it creates a weighted loss distribution that is not heavy-tailed theoretically, there are several advantages to highlight compared to existing methods: 1) it relieves the inefficiency in learning redundant easy samples and overfitting to outliers, 2) It improves training efficiency by preferentially learning samples close to the average loss. Application on real-world time series forecasting datasets demonstrate improvements in prediction quality for 1%-4% using mean square error measurements in channel-independent settings.

In this paper, we pioneer structured analyses of link-level anomalies and graph representation learning for identifying anomalous links in these graphs. First, we introduce a fine-grain taxonomy for edge-level anomalies leveraging structural, temporal, and contextual graph properties. We present a method for generating and injecting such typed anomalies into graphs. Next, we introduce a novel method to generate continuous-time dynamic graphs with consistent patterns across time, structure, and context. To allow temporal graph methods to learn the link anomaly detection task, we extend the generic link prediction setting by: (1) conditioning link existence on contextual edge attributes; and (2) refining the training regime to accommodate diverse perturbations in the negative edge sampler. Building on this, we benchmark methods for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets -- featuring synthetic and labeled organic anomalies and employing six state-of-the-art learning methods -- validate our taxonomy and generation processes for anomalies and benign graphs, as well as our approach to adapting link prediction methods for anomaly detection. Our results further reveal that different learning methods excel in capturing different aspects of graph normality and detecting different types of anomalies.

        <tr id="Time series forecasting has been an essential field in many different application areas, including economic analysis, meteorology, and so forth. The majority of time series forecasting models are trained using the mean squared error (MSE). However, this training based on MSE causes a limitation known as prediction delay. The prediction delay, which implies the ground-truth precedes the prediction, can cause serious problems in a variety of fields, e.g., finance and weather forecasting -- as a matter of fact, predictions succeeding ground-truth observations are not practically meaningful although their MSEs can be low. This paper proposes a new perspective on traditional time series forecasting tasks and introduces a new solution to mitigate the prediction delay. We introduce a continuous-time gated recurrent unit (GRU) based on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) which can supervise explicit time-derivatives. We generalize the GRU architecture in a continuous-time manner and minimize the prediction delay through our time-derivative regularization. Our method outperforms in metrics such as MSE, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Time Distortion Index (TDI).

While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is the more expressive model with better predictive performance, we will show that it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: it does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. Also, TACTiS does not provide any guarantees for marginalization consistency. We develop a novel probabilistic irregular time series forecasting model, Marginalization Consistent Mixtures of Separable Flows (moses), that mixes several normalizing flows with (i) Gaussian Processes with full covariance matrix as source distributions and (ii) a separable invertible transformation, aiming to combine the expressivity of normalizing flows with the marginalization consistency of Gaussians. In experiments on four different datasets we show that moses outperforms other state-of-the-art marginalization consistent models, performs on par with ProFITi, but different from ProFITi, guarantee marginalization consistency.">

Recently, it has been shown that beyond numeric data, graphical transformations can be used with advanced visual models to achieve better performance.

We apply our novel rating method on a variety of numeric and multi-modal forecasting models in a large experimental setup (six input settings of control and perturbations, ten data distributions, time series from six leading stocks in three industries over a year of data, and five time-series forecasters) to draw insights on robust forecasting models and the context of their strengths. Within the scope of our study, our main result is that multi-modal (numeric + visual) forecasting, which was found to be more accurate than numeric forecasting in previous studies, can also be more robust in diverse settings. Our work will help different stakeholders of time-series forecasting understand the models` behaviors along trust (robustness) and accuracy dimensions to select an appropriate model for forecasting using our rating method, leading to improved decision-making.">

However, the algorithm for solving the implicit objective function needs to be differentiable to enable end-to-end learning of the GNN. To facilitate this, we adopt an entropy regularized objective function and propose an iterative optimization process, alternating between solving for the cluster assignments and updating the node/cluster-node embeddings. Notably, our derived closed-form optimization steps are themselves simple yet elegant message passing steps operating seamlessly on a bipartite graph of nodes and cluster-nodes.

We conduct an evaluation to show that while such claims may be sound theoretically, there remain large practical gaps that are empirically observed.

We further show that different inductive biases have inconsistent extrapolation capabilities, highlighting the need to further study such paradigms and investigate why long-context models seemingly fail to behave as one might expect.">

        <tr id="Multivariate time series modeling has been essential in sensor-based data mining tasks. However, capturing complex dynamics caused by intra-variable (temporal) and inter-variable (spatial) relationships while simultaneously taking into account evolving data distributions is a non-trivial task, which faces accumulated computational overhead and multiple temporal patterns or distribution modes. Most existing methods focus on the former direction without adaptive task-specific learning ability. To this end, we developed a holistic spatial-temporal meta-learning probabilistic inference framework, entitled ST-MeLaPI, for the efficient and versatile learning of complex dynamics. Specifically, first, a multivariate relationship recognition module is utilized to learn task-specific inter-variable dependencies. Then, a multiview meta-learning and probabilistic inference strategy was designed to learn shared parameters while enabling the fast and flexible learning of task-specific parameters for different batches. At the core are spatial dependency-oriented and temporal pattern-oriented meta-learning approximate probabilistic inference modules, which can quickly adapt to changing environments via stochastic neurons at each timestamp. Finally, a gated aggregation scheme is leveraged to realize appropriate information selection for the generative style prediction. We benchmarked our approach against state-of-the-art methods with real-world data. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the baselines.">

Recent advancements in the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and attention mechanisms have markedly enhanced the accuracy of runoff forecasting models. This article introduces an innovative hybrid model, ResTCN-DAM, which synergizes the strengths of deep residual network (ResNet), temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), and dual attention mechanisms (DAMs). The proposed ResTCN-DAM is designed to leverage the unique attributes of these three modules: TCN has outstanding capability to process time series data in parallel. By combining with modified ResNet, multiple TCN layers can be densely stacked to capture more hidden information in the temporal dimension. DAM module adeptly captures the interdependencies within both temporal and feature dimensions, adeptly accentuating relevant time steps/features while diminishing less significant ones with minimal computational cost. Furthermore, the snapshot ensemble method is able to obtain the effect of training multiple models through one single training process, which ensures the accuracy and robustness of the forecasts. The deep integration and collaborative cooperation of these modules comprehensively enhance the model's forecasting capability from various perspectives. Ablation studies conducted validate the efficacy of each module, and through multiple sets of comparative experiments, it is shown that the proposed ResTCN-DAM has exceptional and consistent performance across varying lead times. We also employ visualization techniques to display heatmaps of the model's weights, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. When compared with the prevailing neural network-based runoff forecasting models, ResTCN-DAM exhibits state-of-the-art accuracy, temporal robustness, and interpretability, positioning it at the forefront of contemporary research.">

        <tr id="Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification tasks but often fail to generalize when training and test nodes come from different distributions, limiting their practicality. To overcome this, recent approaches adopt invariant learning techniques from the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization field, which seek to establish stable prediction methods across environments. However, the applicability of these invariant assumptions to graph data remains unverified, and such methods often lack solid theoretical support. In this work, we introduce the Topology-Aware Dynamic Reweighting (TAR) framework, which dynamically adjusts sample weights through gradient flow in the geometric Wasserstein space during training. Instead of relying on strict invariance assumptions, we prove that our method is able to provide distributional robustness, thereby enhancing the out-of-distribution generalization performance on graph data. By leveraging the inherent graph structure, TAR effectively addresses distribution shifts. Our framework's superiority is demonstrated through standard testing on four graph OOD datasets and three class-imbalanced node classification datasets, exhibiting marked improvements over existing methods.">

Traditionally, this has been addressed through autoregressive generation using next-event prediction models, such as Marked Temporal Point Processes. However, autoregressive methods use their own output for future predictions, potentially reducing quality as the prediction horizon extends. In this paper, we challenge traditional approaches by introducing a novel benchmark, HoTPP, specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to predict event sequences over a horizon. This benchmark features a new metric inspired by object detection in computer vision, addressing the limitations of existing metrics in assessing models with imprecise time-step predictions. Our evaluations on established datasets employing various models demonstrate that high accuracy in next-event prediction does not necessarily translate to superior horizon prediction, and vice versa. HoTPP aims to serve as a valuable tool for developing more robust event sequence prediction methods, ultimately paving the way for further advancements in the field.">

        <tr id="Recently, multiple models proposed for link prediction (LP) demonstrate impressive results on benchmark datasets. However, many popular benchmark datasets often assume that dataset samples are drawn from the same distribution (i.e., IID samples). In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; since uncontrolled factors may lead train and test samples to come from separate distributions. To tackle the distribution shift problem, recent work focuses on creating datasets that feature distribution shifts and designing generalization methods that perform well on the new data. However, those studies only consider distribution shifts that affect {\it node-} and {\it graph-level} tasks, thus ignoring link-level tasks. Furthermore, relatively few LP generalization methods exist. To bridge this gap, we introduce a set of LP-specific data splits which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift. We verify the shift's effect empirically through evaluation of different SOTA LP methods and subsequently couple these methods with generalization techniques. Interestingly, LP-specific methods frequently generalize poorly relative to heuristics or basic GNN methods. Finally, this work provides analysis to uncover insights for enhancing LP generalization.

        <tr id="In multivariate time series (MTS) classification, finding the important features (e.g., sensors) for model performance is crucial yet challenging due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of MTS data, intricate temporal dynamics, and the necessity for domain-specific interpretations. Current explanation methods for MTS mostly focus on time-centric explanations, apt for pinpointing important time periods but less effective in identifying key features. This limitation underscores the pressing need for a feature-centric approach, a vital yet often overlooked perspective that complements time-centric analysis. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel feature-centric explanation and evaluation framework for MTS, named CAFO (Channel Attention and Feature Orthgonalization). CAFO employs a convolution-based approach with channel attention mechanisms, incorporating a depth-wise separable channel attention module (DepCA) and a QR decomposition-based loss for promoting feature-wise orthogonality. We demonstrate that this orthogonalization enhances the separability of attention distributions, thereby refining and stabilizing the ranking of feature importance. This improvement in feature-wise ranking enhances our understanding of feature explainability in MTS. Furthermore, we develop metrics to evaluate global and class-specific feature importance. Our framework's efficacy is validated through extensive empirical analyses on two major public benchmarks and real-world datasets, both synthetic and self-collected, specifically designed to highlight class-wise discriminative features. The results confirm CAFO's robustness and informative capacity in assessing feature importance in MTS classification tasks. This study not only advances the understanding of feature-centric explanations in MTS but also sets a foundation for future explorations in feature-centric explanations.">

To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missingness ratios and patterns on model performance.

However, explaining the decisions made by GNNs poses challenges because of the aggregated relational information based on graph structure, leading to complex data transformations. Existing methods for explaining GNNs often face limitations in systematically exploring diverse substructures and evaluating results in the absence of ground truths. To address this gap, we introduce GNNAnatomy, a model- and dataset-agnostic visual analytics system designed to facilitate the generation and evaluation of multi-level explanations for GNNs. In GNNAnatomy, we employ graphlets to elucidate GNN behavior in graph-level classification tasks. By analyzing the associations between GNN classifications and graphlet frequencies, we formulate hypothesized factual and counterfactual explanations. To validate a hypothesized graphlet explanation, we introduce two metrics: (1) the correlation between its frequency and the classification confidence, and (2) the change in classification confidence after removing this substructure from the original graph. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNAnatomy, we conduct case studies on both real-world and synthetic graph datasets from various domains.

They are usually intrinsically interlinked as they describe the users and their behaviors over different perimeters. Moreover, it contains both numerical and categorical features, adding complexity to the anonymization task.

MPNNs iteratively update each node's representation in an input graph by aggregating messages from the node's neighbors, which necessitates a memory complexity of the order of the number of graph edges. This complexity might quickly become prohibitive for large graphs provided they are not very sparse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to alleviate this problem by approximating the input graph as an intersecting community graph (ICG) -- a combination of intersecting cliques. The key insight is that the number of communities required to approximate a graph does not depend on the graph size. We develop a new constructive version of the Weak Graph Regularity Lemma to efficiently construct an approximating ICG for any input graph. We then devise an efficient graph learning algorithm operating directly on ICG in linear memory and time with respect to the number of nodes (rather than edges). This offers a new and fundamentally different pipeline for learning on very large non-sparse graphs, whose applicability is demonstrated empirically on node classification tasks and spatio-temporal data processing.">

While many CD methods have been proposed with either impressive quality or efficiency, balancing the two aspects remains a challenge. This study explores the potential of deep graph learning to achieve a better trade-off between the quality and efficiency of K-agnostic CD, where the number of communities K is unknown. We propose PRoCD (Pre-training&Refinement fOr Community Detection), a simple yet effective method that reformulates K-agnostic CD as the binary node pair classification. PRoCD follows a pre-training&refinement paradigm inspired by recent advances in pre-training techniques. We first conduct the offline pre-training of PRoCD on small synthetic graphs covering various topology properties. Based on the inductive inference across graphs, we then generalize the pre-trained model (with frozen parameters) to large real graphs and use the derived CD results as the initialization of an existing efficient CD method (e.g., InfoMap) to further refine the quality of CD results. In addition to benefiting from the transfer ability regarding quality, the online generalization and refinement can also help achieve high inference efficiency, since there is no time-consuming model optimization. Experiments on public datasets with various scales demonstrate that PRoCD can ensure higher efficiency in K-agnostic CD without significant quality degradation.">

        <tr id="Scaling up deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods presents a significant challenge. Following developments in generative modelling, model-based RL positions itself as a strong contender. Recent advances in sequence modelling have led to effective transformer-based world models, albeit at the price of heavy computations due to the long sequences of tokens required to accurately simulate environments. In this work, we propose $\Delta$-IRIS, a new agent with a world model architecture composed of a discrete autoencoder that encodes stochastic deltas between time steps and an autoregressive transformer that predicts future deltas by summarizing the current state of the world with continuous tokens. In the Crafter benchmark, $\Delta$-IRIS sets a new state of the art at multiple frame budgets, while being an order of magnitude faster to train than previous attention-based approaches. We release our code and models at https://github.com/vmicheli/delta-iris.">

Understanding the functional principles of these networks is critical to developing ideal model architectures and optimization strategies. Previous studies typically only emphasize the network representation post-training, overlooking their evolution process throughout training. Here, we present Multiway Multislice PHATE (MM-PHATE), a novel method for visualizing the evolution of RNNs' hidden states. MM-PHATE is a graph-based embedding using structured kernels across the multiple dimensions spanned by RNNs: time, training epoch, and units. We demonstrate on various datasets that MM-PHATE uniquely preserves hidden representation community structure among units and identifies information processing and compression phases during training. The embedding allows users to look under the hood of RNNs across training and provides an intuitive and comprehensive strategy to understanding the network's internal dynamics and draw conclusions, e.g., on why and how one model outperforms another or how a specific architecture might impact an RNN's learning ability.">

        <tr id="The self-attention mechanism has been adopted in several widely-used message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) (e.g., GATs), which adaptively controls the amount of information that flows along the edges of the underlying graph. This usage of attention has made such models a baseline for studies on explainable AI (XAI) since interpretations via attention have been popularized in various domains (e.g., natural language processing and computer vision). However, existing studies often use naive calculations to derive attribution scores from attention, and do not take the precise and careful calculation of edge attribution into consideration. In our study, we aim to fill the gap between the widespread usage of attention-enabled MPNNs and their potential in largely under-explored explainability, a topic that has been actively investigated in other areas. To this end, as the first attempt, we formalize the problem of edge attribution from attention weights in GNNs. Then, we propose GATT, an edge attribution calculation method built upon the computation tree. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method when evaluating attributions from GATs. Conversely, we empirically validate that simply averaging attention weights over graph attention layers is insufficient to interpret the GAT model's behavior.

Firstly, the original data is divided according to different scale factors, and the sequence information in different scale data is extracted by TSSA-ED network. TSSA-ED network consists of temporal attention module and spatial attention module, which are used to capture temporal dependence and spatial dependence respectively. The input forms of the two modules are different, one is all time steps of single variable, and the other is all variables of the same time step. Finally, the model is applied to predict the dome temperature and exhaust gas temperature in the production process of hot blast stove, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, these models still underperform transformers especially on tasks that require in-context retrieval. While more expressive variants of linear transformers which replace the additive outer-product update in linear transformers with the delta rule have been found to be more effective at associative recall, existing algorithms for training such models do not parallelize over sequence length and are thus inefficient to train on modern hardware. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for training linear transformers with the delta rule, which exploits a memory-efficient representation for computing products of Householder matrices. This algorithm allows us to scale up DeltaNet to standard language modeling settings. We train a 1.3B model for 100B tokens and find that it outperforms recent linear-time baselines such as Mamba and GLA in terms of perplexity and zero-shot performance on downstream tasks (including on tasks that focus on recall). We also experiment with two hybrid models which combine DeltaNet layers with (1) sliding-window attention layers every other layer or (2) two global attention layers, and find that these hybrid models outperform strong transformer baselines.">

Data augmentation techniques offer a potential solution to address these challenges, yet their effectiveness on multivariate time series datasets remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method for time series data named Mean Gaussian Noise (MGN). We investigate the performance of MGN compared to eight existing basic data augmentation methods on a multivariate time series dataset for solar flare prediction, SWAN-SF, using a ML algorithm for time series data, TimeSeriesSVC.

Owing to the complexity of port systems, traditional load forecasting methods often struggle to capture the non-linearity and multifactorial interactions within the factors creating power load. To address these challenges, this study combines variational mode decomposition (VMD), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) network to develop a multi-feature-based VMD-TCN-LSTM model for the short-term forecasting of the power load of ports. VMD is first used to decompose the power load series of ports into multiple, relatively stable components to mitigate volatility. Furthermore, meteorological and temporal features are introduced into the TCN-LSTM model, which combines the temporal feature extraction capability of the TCN and the long term-dependent learning capability of the LSTM. Comparative analyses with other common forecasting models using the observed power load data from a coastal port in China demonstrate that the proposed forecasting model achieves a higher prediction accuracy, with an R-squared value of 0.94, mean squared error of 3.59 MW, and a mean absolute percentage error of 2.36%.">

Specifically, STGGT uses GCNs to extract spatial dependencies, utilizes attention and GRUs to extract temporal dependencies, and handle long‐term prediction. Experiments indicate that STGGT outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art baseline models on two real‐world traffic datasets of 9%–40%.

We call this benchmark Seq-to-Final to highlight the focus on using a sequence of time periods to learn a model for the final time point. Our synthetic benchmark allows users to construct sequences with different types of shift and compare different methods. We focus on image classification tasks using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as the base images for the synthetic sequences. We also evaluate the same methods on the Portraits dataset to explore the relevance to real-world shifts over time. Finally, we create a visualization to contrast the initializations and updates from different methods at the final time step. Our results suggest that, for the sequences in our benchmark, methods that disregard the sequential structure and adapt to the final time point tend to perform well.

One such task is forecasting the future outcome of events. In this work we describe experiments using a novel dataset of real world events and associated human predictions, an evaluation metric to measure forecasting ability, and the accuracy of a number of different LLM based forecasting designs on the provided dataset. Additionally, we analyze the performance of the LLM forecasters against human predictions and find that models still struggle to make accurate predictions about the future. Our follow-up experiments indicate this is likely due to models' tendency to guess that most events are unlikely to occur (which tends to be true for many prediction datasets, but does not reflect actual forecasting abilities). We reflect on next steps for developing a systematic and reliable approach to studying LLM forecasting.">

 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep learning models specifically designed for analyzing graph-structured data, capturing complex relationships and structures to improve analysis and prediction. A common task in GNNs is node classification, where each node in the graph is assigned a predefined category. The Graph Attention Network (GAT) is a popular variant of GNNs known for its ability to capture complex dependencies by assigning importance weights to nodes during information aggregation. However, the GAT’s reliance on local attention mechanisms limits its effectiveness in capturing global information and long-range dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose a new attention mechanism called Global-Local Graph Attention (GLGA). Our mechanism enables the GAT to capture long-range dependencies and global graph structures while maintaining its ability to focus on local interactions. We evaluate our algorithm on three citation datasets (Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed) using multiple metrics, demonstrating its superiority over other baseline models. The proposed GLGA mechanism has been proven to be an effective solution for improving node classification tasks.">

        <tr id="Heterogeneous graphs are an essential structure that models real-world data through different types of nodes and relationships between them, including multimodality, which comprises different types of data such as text, image, and audio. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a prominent graph representation learning method that takes advantage of the graph structure and its attributes that, when applied to the multimodal heterogeneous graph, learn a unique semantic space for the different modalities. Consequently, it allows multimodal fusion through simple operators such as sum, average, or multiplication, generating unified representations considering the supplementary and complementarity relationships between the modalities. In multimodal heterogeneous graphs, the labeling process tends to be even more costly due to the multiple modalities analyzed, in addition to the imbalance of classes inherent to some applications. In order to overcome these problems in applications that comprise a class of interest, One-Class Learning (OCL) is used. Given the lack of studies on multimodal early fusion in heterogeneous graphs for OCL tasks, we proposed a method based on unsupervised GNN for heterogeneous graphs and evaluated different early fusion operators. In this paper, we extend another work by evaluating the behavior of the main GNN convolutions in the method. We highlight that using operators such as average, addition, and subtraction were the best early fusion operators. In addition, GNN layers that do not use an attention mechanism performed better. In this way, we argue for heterogeneous graph neural networks in multimodal using early fusion simple operators instead of well-often-used concatenation and less complex convolutions.">

        <tr id="Due to the performance degradation of graph neural networks (GNNs) under distribution shifts, the work on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs has received widespread attention. A novel perspective involves distinguishing potential confounding biases from different environments through environmental identification, enabling the model to escape environmentally-sensitive correlations and maintain stable performance under distribution shifts. However, in graph data, confounding factors not only affect the generation process of node features but also influence the complex interaction between nodes. We observe that neglecting either aspect of them will lead to a decrease in performance. In this paper, we propose IENE, an OOD generalization method on graphs based on node-level environmental identification and extrapolation techniques. It strengthens the model's ability to extract invariance from two granularities simultaneously, leading to improved generalization. Specifically, to identify invariance in features, we utilize the disentangled information bottleneck framework to achieve mutual promotion between node-level environmental estimation and invariant feature learning. Furthermore, we extrapolate topological environments through graph augmentation techniques to identify structural invariance. We implement the conceptual method with specific algorithms and provide theoretical analysis and proofs for our approach. Extensive experimental evaluations on two synthetic and four real-world OOD datasets validate the superiority of IENE, which outperforms existing techniques and provides a flexible framework for enhancing the generalization of GNNs.">

        <tr id="The Transformer model has shown leading performance in time series forecasting. Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

        <tr id="Dataset condensation is a newborn technique that generates a small dataset that can be used in training deep neural networks to lower training costs. The objective of dataset condensation is to ensure that the model trained with the synthetic dataset can perform comparably to the model trained with full datasets. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on classification tasks, posing challenges in their adaptation to time series forecasting (TS-forecasting). This challenge arises from disparities in the evaluation of synthetic data. In classification, the synthetic data is considered well-distilled if the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset yield identical labels for the same input, regardless of variations in output logits distribution. Conversely, in TS-forecasting, the effectiveness of synthetic data distillation is determined by the distance between predictions of the two models. The synthetic data is deemed well-distilled only when all data points within the predictions are similar. Consequently, TS-forecasting has a more rigorous evaluation methodology compared to classification. To mitigate this gap, we theoretically analyze the optimization objective of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting and propose a new one-line plugin of dataset condensation designated as Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting (CondTSF) based on our analysis. Plugging CondTSF into previous dataset condensation methods facilitates a reduction in the distance between the predictions of the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on eight commonly used time series datasets. CondTSF consistently improves the performance of all previous dataset condensation methods across all datasets, particularly at low condensing ratios.">

        <tr id="Identification of critical nodes is a prominent topic in the study of complex networks. Numerous methods have been proposed, yet most exhibit inherent limitations. Traditional approaches primarily analyze specific structural features of the network; however, node influence is typically the result of a combination of multiple factors. Machine learning-based methods struggle to effectively represent the complex characteristics of network structures through suitable embedding techniques and require substantial data for training, rendering them prohibitively costly for large-scale networks. To address these challenges, this paper presents an active learning model based on GraphSAGE and Transformer, named GNNTAL. This model is initially pre-trained on random or synthetic networks and subsequently fine-tuned on real-world networks by selecting a few representative nodes using K-Means clustering and uncertainty sampling. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it significantly reduces training costs; (2) it simultaneously incorporates both local and global features. A series of comparative experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks demonstrate that GNNTAL achieves superior performance. Additionally, this paper proposes an influence maximization method based on the predictions of the GNNTAL model, which achieves optimal performance without the need for complex computations. Finally, the paper analyses certain limitations of the GNNTAL model and suggests potential solutions.">

The learned representation can be used for downstream machine-learning tasks such as clustering and classification. The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality. We show the competitive performance of our method on real-world time-series data with the baselines and demonstrate its effectiveness for symbolic text modeling and RNA sequence clustering.">

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive benchmark comprising 300 tabular datasets, covering a wide range of task types, size distributions, and domains. We perform an extensive comparison between state-of-the-art deep tabular methods and tree-based methods, revealing the average rank of all methods and highlighting the key factors that influence the success of deep tabular methods. Next, we analyze deep tabular methods based on their training dynamics, including changes in validation metrics and other statistics. For each dataset-method pair, we learn a mapping from both the meta-features of datasets and the first part of the validation curve to the final validation set performance and even the evolution of validation curves. This mapping extracts essential meta-features that influence prediction accuracy, helping the analysis of tabular methods from novel aspects. Based on the performance of all methods on this large benchmark, we identify two subsets of 45 datasets each. The first subset contains datasets that favor either tree-based methods or DNN-based methods, serving as effective analysis tools to evaluate strategies (e.g., attribute encoding strategies) for improving deep tabular models. The second subset contains datasets where the ranks of methods are consistent with the overall benchmark, acting as a probe for tabular analysis.

Classic (distributional) regression approaches like Generalized Linear Models (GLMs; Nelder and Wedderburn, 1972) are commonly used, but challenges remain in developing models that can (i) allow covariates to flexibly impact different aspects of the conditional distribution, (ii) integrate developments in machine learning and AI to maximise the predictive power while considering (i), and, (iii) maintain a level of interpretability in the model to enhance trust in the model and its outputs, which is often compromised in efforts pursuing (i) and (ii). We tackle this problem by proposing a Distributional Refinement Network (DRN), which combines an inherently interpretable baseline model (such as GLMs) with a flexible neural network-a modified Deep Distribution Regression (DDR; Li et al., 2019) method. Inspired by the Combined Actuarial Neural Network (CANN; Schelldorfer and W{\''u}thrich, 2019), our approach flexibly refines the entire baseline distribution. As a result, the DRN captures varying effects of features across all quantiles, improving predictive performance while maintaining adequate interpretability. Using both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the DRN's superior distributional forecasting capacity. The DRN has the potential to be a powerful distributional regression model in actuarial science and beyond.">

        <tr id="Transformer architectures have been widely adopted in foundation models. Due to their high inference costs, there is renewed interest in exploring the potential of efficient recurrent architectures (RNNs). In this paper, we analyze the differences in the representational capabilities of Transformers and RNNs across several tasks of practical relevance, including index lookup, nearest neighbor, recognizing bounded Dyck languages, and string equality. For the tasks considered, our results show separations based on the size of the model required for different architectures. For example, we show that a one-layer Transformer of logarithmic width can perform index lookup, whereas an RNN requires a hidden state of linear size. Conversely, while constant-size RNNs can recognize bounded Dyck languages, we show that one-layer Transformers require a linear size for this task. Furthermore, we show that two-layer Transformers of logarithmic size can perform decision tasks such as string equality or disjointness, whereas both one-layer Transformers and recurrent models require linear size for these tasks. We also show that a log-size two-layer Transformer can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm in its forward pass; on the other hand recurrent models require linear size. Our constructions are based on the existence of $N$ nearly orthogonal vectors in $O(\log N)$ dimensional space and our lower bounds are based on reductions from communication complexity problems. We supplement our theoretical results with experiments that highlight the differences in the performance of these architectures on practical-size sequences.">

        <tr id="Long-term time series forecasting is a long-standing challenge in various applications. A central issue in time series forecasting is that methods should expressively capture long-term dependency. Furthermore, time series forecasting methods should be flexible when applied to different scenarios. Although Fourier analysis offers an alternative to effectively capture reusable and periodic patterns to achieve long-term forecasting in different scenarios, existing methods often assume high-frequency components represent noise and should be discarded in time series forecasting. However, we conduct a series of motivation experiments and discover that the role of certain frequencies varies depending on the scenarios. In some scenarios, removing high-frequency components from the original time series can improve the forecasting performance, while in others scenarios, removing them is harmful to forecasting performance. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the frequencies differently according to specific scenarios. To achieve this, we first reformulate the time series forecasting problem as learning a transfer function of each frequency in the Fourier domain. Further, we design Frequency Dynamic Fusion (FreDF), which individually predicts each Fourier component, and dynamically fuses the output of different frequencies. Moreover, we provide a novel insight into the generalization ability of time series forecasting and propose the generalization bound of time series forecasting. Then we prove FreDF has a lower bound, indicating that FreDF has better generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FreDF.">

        <tr id="Long-term solar wind sequence forecasting is essential for understanding the influence of the solar wind on celestial settings, predicting variations in solar wind parameters, and identifying patterns of solar activity. The intrinsic erratic temporal features of solar wind datasets present significant challenges to the development of solar wind factor estimate techniques. In response to these challenges, we present MoCoformer, a novel model based on the Transformer model in deep learning that integrates the Multi-Mode Decomp Block and Mode Independence Attention. The Multi-Mode Decomp Block employs an optimized version of variational mode decomposition technology to flexibly handle irregular features by adaptively decomposing and modeling the impact of sudden events on the temporal dynamics, enhancing its ability to manage non-stationary and irregular features effectively. Meanwhile, the Mode Independence Attention module computes attention independently for each mode, capturing the correlation between sequences and mitigating the negative impact of irregular features on time series prediction. The experimental results on solar wind datasets demonstrate that MoCoformer significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in time series forecasting, showcasing superior predictive performance. This underscores the resilience of MoCoformer in handling the intricate, irregular temporal characteristics of solar wind data, rendering it a valuable instrument for enhancing the understanding and forecasting of solar wind dynamics.">

        <tr id="Distribution shifts between training and test data are all but inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model and lead to performance decay. Adapting the model can hopefully mitigate this drop in performance. Yet, adaptation is challenging since it must be unsupervised: we usually do not have access to any labeled data at test time. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic state-space model that can adapt a deployed model subjected to distribution drift. Our model learns the dynamics induced by distribution shifts on the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, we infer time-evolving class prototypes that serve as a dynamic classification head. Moreover, our approach is lightweight, modifying only the model's last linear layer. In experiments on real-world distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions, we demonstrate that our approach performs competitively with methods that require back-propagation and access to the model backbone. Our model especially excels in the case of small test batches - the most difficult setting.">

Transfer learning has emerged as a promising solution to address this challenge by leveraging knowledge from source domains to enhance learning in a target domain. Existing transfer learning methods for node classification primarily focus on integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with various transfer learning techniques. While these approaches have shown promising results, they often suffer from a lack of theoretical guarantees, restrictive conditions, and high sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Graph Convolutional Multinomial Logistic Regression (GCR) model and a transfer learning method based on the GCR model, called Trans-GCR. We provide theoretical guarantees of the estimate obtained under GCR model in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, Trans-GCR demonstrates superior empirical performance, has a low computational cost, and requires fewer hyperparameters than existing methods.">

        <tr id="Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are promising for graph learning tasks. For privacy-preserving graph learning tasks involving distributed graph datasets, federated learning (FL)-based GCN (FedGCN) training is required. An important open challenge for FedGCN is scaling to large graphs, which typically incurs 1) high computation overhead for handling the explosively-increasing number of neighbors, and 2) high communication overhead of training GCNs involving multiple FL clients. Thus, neighbor sampling is being studied to enhance the scalability of FedGCNs. Existing FedGCN training techniques with neighbor sampling often produce extremely large communication and computation overhead and inaccurate node embeddings, leading to poor model performance. To bridge this gap, we propose the Federated Adaptive Attention-based Sampling (FedAAS) approach. It achieves substantial cost savings by efficiently leveraging historical embedding estimators and focusing the limited communication resources on transmitting the most influential neighbor node embeddings across FL clients. We further design an adaptive embedding synchronization scheme to optimize the efficiency and accuracy of FedAAS on large-scale datasets. Theoretical analysis shows that the approximation error induced by the staleness of historical embedding is upper bounded, and the model is guaranteed to converge in an efficient manner. Extensive experimental evaluation against four state-of-the-art baselines on six real-world graph datasets show that FedAAS achieves up to 5.12% higher test accuracy, while saving communication and computation costs by 95.11% and 94.76%, respectively.">

While the consideration of external techno-economic features could improve the modeling of the short-term dynamics of grid frequency, such features are often only recorded on an hourly basis and require careful treatment. We present a purely data-driven approach to modeling grid frequency as an alternative to prediction models incorporating physical characteristics of power systems. Using sequence models such as gated recurrent units and transformers, we extract the necessary information and relationships from the static frequency vector to predict the process parameters for the short-term dynamics of frequency following a Gaussian process. Both for the evaluation measures (e.g. MSE, MAE, RMSE) for point estimators and for the measures for probalistic evaluations (e.g. Negative Log Likelihood Score, CPRS and Energy Score), our prediction performance is comparable to state-of-the-art models and outperforms various purely data-driven models such as daily profiles and k-nearest-neighbour profiles.

        <tr id="There is an important challenge in systematically interpreting the internal representations of deep neural networks. This study introduces a multi-dimensional quantification and visualization approach which can capture two temporal dimensions of a model learning experience: the “information processing trajectory” and the “developmental trajectory.” The former represents the influence of incoming signals on an agent’s decision-making, while the latter conceptualizes the gradual improvement in an agent’s performance throughout its lifespan. Tracking the learning curves of a DNN enables researchers to explicitly identify the model appropriateness of a given task, examine the properties of the underlying input signals, and assess the model’s alignment (or lack thereof) with human learning experiences. To illustrate the method, we conducted 750 runs of simulations on two temporal tasks: gesture detection and natural language processing (NLP) classification, showcasing its applicability across a spectrum of deep learning tasks. Based on the quantitative analysis of the learning curves across two distinct datasets, we have identified three insights gained from mapping these curves: nonlinearity, pairwise comparisons, and domain distinctions. We reflect on the theoretical implications of this method for cognitive processing, language models and multimodal representation. Author summary Deep learning networks, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are designed for processing incoming signals sequentially, making them intuitive computational systems for studying cognitive processing that involves dynamic contexts. There has been a tradition in the fields of machine learning and neuro-cognitive science to examine how a system (either humans or models) represents information through various computational and statistical techniques. Our study takes this one step further by devising a technique for examining the “learning curves” of deep learning networks utilizing the sequential representations as part of RNNs’ architectures. Just as humans develop learning curves when solving problems, the introduced method captures both how incoming signals help improve decision-making and how a system’s problem-solving abilities enhance when encountering the same situation multiple times throughout its lifespan. Our study selected two distinct tasks: gesture detection and emotion tweet classification, to illustrate the insights researchers can draw from mapping models’ learning curves. The proposed method hinted that gesture learning experiences are smoother, while language learning relies on sudden knowledge gains during processing, corroborating the findings from previous literature.">

In this regime, we propose a Decoupled MTPP framework that disentangles characterization of a stochastic process into a set of evolving influences from different events. Our approach employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to learn flexible continuous dynamics of these influences while simultaneously addressing multiple inference problems, such as density estimation and survival rate computation. We emphasize the significance of disentangling the influences by comparing our framework with state-of-the-art methods on real-life datasets, and provide analysis on the model behavior for potential applications.">

Furthermore, we leverage the high frequency of our data to derive monthly estimates of R&D expenditures, which are currently unobserved. We compare our results with those obtained from the classical regression-based and the sparse temporal disaggregation methods. Finally, we validate our results by reporting a strong correlation with monthly R&D employment data.">

Firstly, the framework preprocesses the raw data, extracting and recording timestamp information between interactions. It then introduces the concept of “Temporal Information Entropy (TIE)”, integrating it into the Node2Vec algorithm’s random walk to generate initial feature vectors for nodes in the graph. A causality analysis model is subsequently applied for secondary processing of the generated feature vectors. Following this, an equal dataset is constructed by adjusting the ratio of positive and negative samples. Lastly, a dedicated GCN model is used for model training. Through extensive experimentation in multiple real social networks, the framework proposed in this study demonstrated a better performance than other methods in key evaluation indicators such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.

The forward and backward processes gradually perturb and denoise log-signatures preserving their algebraic structure. To recover a signal from its log-signature, we provide new closed-form inversion formulae expressing the coefficients obtained by expanding the signal in a given basis (e.g. Fourier or orthogonal polynomials) as explicit polynomial functions of the log-signature. Finally, we show that combining SigDiffusion with these inversion formulae results in highly realistic time series generation, competitive with the current state-of-the-art on various datasets of synthetic and real-world examples.">

In prior work, long temporal context is captured by constructing a long-term memory bank consisting of past and future video features which are then integrated into standard (short-term) video recognition backbones through the use of attention mechanisms. Two well-known problems related to this approach are the quadratic complexity of the attention operation and the fact that the whole feature bank must be stored in memory for inference. To address both issues, we propose an alternative to attention-based schemes which is based on a low-rank approximation of the memory obtained using Singular Value Decomposition. Our scheme has two advantages: (a) it reduces complexity by more than an order of magnitude, and (b) it is amenable to an efficient implementation for the calculation of the memory bases in an incremental fashion which does not require the storage of the whole feature bank in memory. The proposed scheme matches or surpasses the accuracy achieved by attention-based mechanisms while being memory-efficient. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework generalises to different architectures and tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art in three datasets.">

        <tr id="Neural networks have become a focal point in the realms of time series analysis and data mining. However, unlike in the field of images, time series datasets are typically smaller in scale and exhibit substantial imbalance in data types, making models prone to overfitting. The conventional SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) method is widely used for addressing imbalanced datasets through data augmentation. Nevertheless, when applied to time series data, the classical SMOTE method struggles to effectively accommodate the characteristics of time sequences, resulting in suboptimal performance on time series datasets. To address this issue, this paper proposes an enhanced algorithm, namely M-SMOTE. This algorithm relies on specific partitioning rules to classify minority class samples into safe points and noise points. Subsequently, linear interpolation is applied only between safe points and the centroid of minority class samples (i.e., the mean of minority class samples), effectively mitigating issues related to data marginalization. Additionally, the M-SMOTE algorithm avoids the uncertainty associated with selecting the k value in traditional SMOTE algorithms. In situations where time series with similar features may undergo phase shifts, the method employs dynamic time warping to obtain more reasonable similarities between different time sequences. Comparative experiments are conducted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the performance of the mentioned models when trained on datasets processed using the M-SMOTE method. This approach provides an effective and innovative solution for addressing imbalance issues in time series datasets.">

        <tr id="We introduce and detail an atypical neural network architecture, called time elastic neural network (teNN), for multivariate time series classification. The novelty compared to classical neural network architecture is that it explicitly incorporates time warping ability, as well as a new way of considering attention. In addition, this architecture is capable of learning a dropout strategy, thus optimizing its own architecture.Behind the design of this architecture, our overall objective is threefold: firstly, we are aiming at improving the accuracy of instance based classification approaches that shows quite good performances as far as enough training data is available. Secondly we seek to reduce the computational complexity inherent to these methods to improve their scalability. Ideally, we seek to find an acceptable balance between these first two criteria. And finally, we seek to enhance the explainability of the decision provided by this kind of neural architecture.The experiment demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent implemented to train a teNN is quite effective. To the extent that the selection of some critical meta-parameters is correct, convergence is generally smooth and fast.While maintaining good accuracy, we get a drastic gain in scalability by first reducing the required number of reference time series, i.e. the number of teNN cells required. Secondly, we demonstrate that, during the training process, the teNN succeeds in reducing the number of neurons required within each cell. Finally, we show that the analysis of the activation and attention matrices as well as the reference time series after training provides relevant information to interpret and explain the classification results.The comparative study that we have carried out and which concerns around thirty diverse and multivariate datasets shows that the teNN obtains results comparable to those of the state of the art, in particular similar to those of a network mixing LSTM and CNN architectures for example.">

Causal discovery aims to recover the DAG structure using observational data. This paper focuses on causal discovery with multi-variate count data. We are motivated by real-world web visit data, recording individual user visits to multiple websites. Building a causal diagram can help understand user behavior in transitioning between websites, inspiring operational strategy. A challenge in modeling is user heterogeneity, as users with different backgrounds exhibit varied behaviors. Additionally, social network connections can result in similar behaviors among friends. We introduce personalized Binomial DAG models to address heterogeneity and network dependency between observations, which are common in real-world applications. To learn the proposed DAG model, we develop an algorithm that embeds the network structure into a dimension-reduced covariate, learns each node's neighborhood to reduce the DAG search space, and explores the variance-mean relation to determine the ordering. Simulations show our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in heterogeneous data. We demonstrate its practical usefulness on a real-world web visit dataset.">

Precise forecasts aid in managing and optimizing transportation systems, reducing congestion, and improving air quality by cutting emissions. However, predicting outcomes is difficult due to intricate spatial relationships, nonlinear temporal patterns, and the challenges associated with long-term forecasting. Current research often uses static graph structures, overlooking dynamic and long-range dependencies. To tackle these issues, we introduce the spatiotemporal dynamic multi-hop network (ST-DMN), a Seq2Seq framework. This model incorporates spatiotemporal convolutional blocks (ST-Blocks) with residual connections in the encoder to condense historical traffic data into a fixed-dimensional vector. A dynamic graph represents time-varying inter-segment relationships, and multi-hop operation in the encoder’s spatial convolutional layer and the decoder’s diffusion multi-hop graph convolutional gated recurrent units (DMGCGRUs) capture long-range dependencies. Experiments on two real-world datasets METR-LA and PEMS-BAY show that ST-DMN surpasses existing models in three metrics.">

Domain knowledge is particularly important in real-world scenarios, where invalid generated graphs hinder deployment in practical applications. Unconstrained and conditioned graph generative models fail to guarantee such domain-specific structural properties. We present ConStruct, a novel framework that allows for hard-constraining graph diffusion models to incorporate specific properties, such as planarity or acyclicity. Our approach ensures that the sampled graphs remain within the domain of graphs that verify the specified property throughout the entire trajectory in both the forward and reverse processes. This is achieved by introducing a specific edge-absorbing noise model and a new projector operator. ConStruct demonstrates versatility across several structural and edge-deletion invariant constraints and achieves state-of-the-art performance for both synthetic benchmarks and attributed real-world datasets. For example, by leveraging planarity in digital pathology graph datasets, the proposed method outperforms existing baselines and enhances generated data validity by up to 71.1 percentage points.">

However, most improvements are in multi-class classification, with less focus on the cases where each node could have multiple labels. The first challenge in studying multi-label node classification is the scarcity of publicly available datasets. To address this, we collected and released three real-world biological datasets and developed a multi-label graph generator with tunable properties. We also argue that traditional notions of homophily and heterophily do not apply well to multi-label scenarios. Therefore, we define homophily and Cross-Class Neighborhood Similarity for multi-label classification and investigate $9$ collected multi-label datasets. Lastly, we conducted a large-scale comparative study with $8$ methods across nine datasets to evaluate current progress in multi-label node classification.

        <tr id="In this paper, we apply a supervised machine-learning approach to solve a fundamental problem in queueing theory: estimating the transient distribution of the number in the system for a G(t)/GI/1. We develop a neural network mechanism that provides a fast and accurate predictor of these distributions for moderate horizon lengths and practical settings. It is based on using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture based on the first several moments of the time-dependant inter-arrival and the stationary service time distributions; we call it the Moment-Based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method (MBRNN ). Our empirical study suggests MBRNN requires only the first four inter-arrival and service time moments. We use simulation to generate a substantial training dataset and present a thorough performance evaluation to examine the accuracy of our method using two different test sets. We show that even under the configuration with the worst performance errors, the mean number of customers over the entire timeline has an error of less than 3%. While simulation modeling can achieve high accuracy, the advantage of the MBRNN over simulation is runtime, while the MBRNN analyzes hundreds of systems within a fraction of a second. This paper focuses on a G(t)/GI/1; however, the MBRNN approach demonstrated here can be extended to other queueing systems, as the training data labeling is based on simulations (which can be applied to more complex systems) and the training is based on deep learning, which can capture very complex time sequence tasks. In summary, the MBRNN can potentially revolutionize our ability to perform transient analyses of queueing systems.">

In this paper, we introduce a novel speed-up method for diffusion model training, called, which is based on a closer look at time steps. Our key findings are: i) Time steps can be empirically divided into acceleration, deceleration, and convergence areas based on the process increment. ii) These time steps are imbalanced, with many concentrated in the convergence area. iii) The concentrated steps provide limited benefits for diffusion training. To address this, we design an asymmetric sampling strategy that reduces the frequency of steps from the convergence area while increasing the sampling probability for steps from other areas. Additionally, we propose a weighting strategy to emphasize the importance of time steps with rapid-change process increments. As a plug-and-play and architecture-agnostic approach, SpeeD consistently achieves 3-times acceleration across various diffusion architectures, datasets, and tasks. Notably, due to its simple design, our approach significantly reduces the cost of diffusion model training with minimal overhead. Our research enables more researchers to train diffusion models at a lower cost.">

Starting with the construction of 6 specific QoS/QoE metrics extracted from a VoIP measurement campaign in an LTE-A environment, we face the problem of predicting the behavior of such metrics across time. A preliminary stage involves estimating a Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) model to capture correlations among the involved time series. This stage also involves statistical checks, such as stationarity and residual autocorrelations, in order to build a consistent model to be used for prediction. In the second stage, we employ a set of recurrent neural networks (simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU) to predict the behavior of selected QoS/QoE metrics. This choice is motivated by the fact that such techniques are able to handle temporal sequences, owing to their cell memory structure. Then, the employed techniques are contrasted in terms of both their offered performance and required computational time. Results provide valuable insights for constructing realistic traffic models (not artificially simulated ones) and useful information for network providers looking to optimize their resources based on usage patterns.">

        <tr id="Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) addresses the challenge of training predictive models under temporally varying data distributions. Traditional TDG approaches typically focus on domain data collected at fixed, discrete time intervals, which limits their capability to capture the inherent dynamics within continuous-evolving and irregularly-observed temporal domains. To overcome this, this work formalizes the concept of Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), where domain data are derived from continuous times and are collected at arbitrary times. CTDG tackles critical challenges including: 1) Characterizing the continuous dynamics of both data and models, 2) Learning complex high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and 3) Optimizing and controlling the generalization across continuous temporal domains. To address them, we propose a Koopman operator-driven continuous temporal domain generalization (Koodos) framework. We formulate the problem within a continuous dynamic system and leverage the Koopman theory to learn the underlying dynamics; the framework is further enhanced with a comprehensive optimization strategy equipped with analysis and control driven by prior knowledge of the dynamics patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.">

Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.">

        <tr id="Evaluating the performance of causal discovery algorithms that aim to find causal relationships between time-dependent processes remains a challenging topic. In this paper, we show that certain characteristics of datasets, such as varsortability (Reisach et al. 2021) and $R^2$-sortability (Reisach et al. 2023), also occur in datasets for autocorrelated stationary time series. We illustrate this empirically using four types of data: simulated data based on SVAR models and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, the data used in the 2019 causality-for-climate challenge (Runge et al. 2019), real-world river stream datasets, and real-world data generated by the Causal Chamber of (Gamella et al. 2024). To do this, we adapt var- and $R^2$-sortability to time series data. We also investigate the extent to which the performance of score-based causal discovery methods goes hand in hand with high sortability. Arguably, our most surprising finding is that the investigated real-world datasets exhibit high varsortability and low $R^2$-sortability indicating that scales may carry a significant amount of causal information.">

We reproduce the original paper results, showcase some significant weaknesses of the methodology and propose ideas to improve both its accuracy and efficiency. Unlike related work, we go beyond evaluation and also showcase the actionability of the produced explainer ranking, by using the best attribution methods for the task of channel selection in MTSC. We find that perturbation-based methods such as SHAP and Feature Ablation work well across a set of datasets, classifiers and tasks and outperform gradient-based methods.

        <tr id="While time series data are prevalent across diverse sectors, data labeling process still remains resource-intensive. This results in a scarcity of labeled data for deep learning, emphasizing the importance of semi-supervised learning techniques. Applying semi-supervised learning to time series data presents unique challenges due to its inherent temporal complexities. Efficient contrastive learning for time series requires specialized methods, particularly in the development of tailored data augmentation techniques. In this paper, we propose a single-step, semi-supervised contrastive learning framework named nearest neighbor contrastive learning for time series (NNCLR-TS). Specifically, the proposed framework incorporates a support set to store representations including their label information, enabling a pseudo-labeling of the unlabeled data based on nearby samples in the latent space. Moreover, our framework presents a novel data augmentation method, which selectively augments only the trend component of the data, effectively preserving their inherent periodic properties and facilitating effective training. For training, we introduce a novel contrastive loss that utilizes the nearest neighbors of augmented data for positive and negative representations. By employing our framework, we unlock the ability to attain high-quality embeddings and achieve remarkable performance in downstream classification tasks, tailored explicitly for time series. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across various benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.">

The approach employs a variable selection method known as the group orthogonal greedy algorithm and the high-dimensional Akaike information criterion to mitigate the impact of irrelevant predictors. Moreover, a novel technique, called peeling, is used to boost the variable selection procedure so that many factor-relevant predictors can be included in prediction. Finally, the supervised dynamic principal component analysis (sdPCA) method is adopted to account for the dynamic information in factor recovery. In simulation studies, we found that the proposed method adapts well to unknown degrees of sparsity and factor strength, which results in good performance even when the number of relevant predictors is large compared to the sample size. Applying to economic and environmental studies, the proposed method consistently performs well compared to some commonly used benchmarks in one-step-ahead out-sample forecasts.">

        <tr id="Building prediction intervals for time series forecasting problems presents a complex challenge, particularly when relying solely on point predictors, a common scenario for practitioners in the industry. While research has primarily focused on achieving increasingly efficient valid intervals, we argue that, when evaluating a set of intervals, traditional measures alone are insufficient. There are additional crucial characteristics: the intervals must vary in length, with this variation directly linked to the difficulty of the prediction, and the coverage of the interval must remain independent of the difficulty of the prediction for practical utility. We propose the Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression (HQR) model and the Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference (WACI) method, providing theoretical coverage guarantees, to overcome those issues, respectively. The methodologies are evaluated in the context of Electricity Price Forecasting and Wind Power Forecasting, representing complex scenarios in time series forecasting. The results demonstrate that HQR and WACI not only improve or achieve typical measures of validity and efficiency but also successfully fulfil the commonly ignored mentioned characteristics.">

        <tr id="Traffic flow forecasting is the foundation of the dynamic control and application of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). It is also of significant practical value in alleviating road congestion. Given the periodic and dynamic changes in trafﬁc ﬂow and the spatiotemporal coupling interaction of complex road networks, trafﬁc ﬂow forecasting is challenging and rarely yields satisfactory prediction results. To capture the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic flow, a new model of traffic flow forecasting based on spatiotemporal convolution and probabilistic sparse self-attention (STC-PSSA) is proposed. It consists of a spatiotemporal graph convolution network (ST-GCN) module, a spatiotemporal convolution module (ST-Conv), and a probabilistic sparse attention module (PSSA). ST-GCN consists of the gated temporal convolutional network (G-TCN) and the graph convolution network (GCN), which are used to capture the temporal dependence and spatial correlation of the traffic flow, respectively. Multiple ST-GCNs are stacked to handle spatial features at various time levels. The ST-Conv captures intricate temporal dependence at the same location and dynamic spatial features at neighboring locations simultaneously. The PSSA combines dynamic spatiotemporal features and performs long-term forecasting efficiently. The experimental results demonstrate that the STC-PSSA model can accurately extract the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic flow and outperforms the popular baseline methods in forecasting accuracy.">

        <tr id="In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.">

        <tr id="Numerous natural and human-made systems exhibit critical transitions whereby slow changes in environmental conditions spark abrupt shifts to a qualitatively distinct state. These shifts very often entail severe consequences; therefore, it is imperative to devise robust and informative approaches for anticipating the onset of critical transitions. Real-world complex systems can comprise hundreds or thousands of interacting entities, and implementing prevention or management strategies for critical transitions requires knowledge of the exact condition in which they will manifest. However, most research so far has focused on low-dimensional systems and small networks containing fewer than ten nodes or has not provided an estimate of the location where the transition will occur. We address these weaknesses by developing a deep-learning framework which can predict the specific location where critical transitions happen in networked systems with size up to hundreds of nodes. These predictions do not rely on the network topology, the edge weights, or the knowledge of system dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our machine-learning-based framework by considering a diverse selection of systems representing both smooth (second-order) and explosive (first-order) transitions: the synchronization transition in coupled Kuramoto oscillators; the sharp decline in the resource biomass present in an ecosystem; and the abrupt collapse of a Wilson-Cowan neuronal system. We show that our method provides accurate predictions for the onset of critical transitions well in advance of their occurrences, is robust to noise and transient data, and relies only on observations of a small fraction of nodes. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real-world systems by considering empirical vegetated ecosystems in Africa.

Conversely, although Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are designed to address long-term dependencies within sequences, they encounter challenges, particularly with very lengthy data sequences, in effectively capturing these dependencies. Consequently, relying solely on SFA or LSTM may prove inadequate for addressing the complexities of time series data in industrial processes. To confront these challenges, this study proposes an innovative approach termed Slow LSTM (SLSTM), which amalgamates the hidden layers of LSTM and SFA to enhance feature extraction. These extracted features are subsequently fed into a fully connected layer for prediction. The efficacy of this proposed method is validated through comparisons with various methods, including SFA-FC, LSTM, and RNN.">

        <tr id="Effectively learning from sequential data is a longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the case of long sequences. From the dawn of Machine Learning, several researchers engaged in the search of algorithms and architectures capable of processing sequences of patterns, retaining information about the past inputs while still leveraging the upcoming data, without losing precious long-term dependencies and correlations. While such an ultimate goal is inspired by the human hallmark of continuous real-time processing of sensory information, several solutions simplified the learning paradigm by artificially limiting the processed context or dealing with sequences of limited length, given in advance. These solutions were further emphasized by the large ubiquity of Transformers, that have initially shaded the role of Recurrent Neural Nets. However, recurrent networks are facing a strong recent revival due to the growing popularity of (deep) State-Space models and novel instances of large-context Transformers, which are both based on recurrent computations to go beyond several limits of currently ubiquitous technologies. In fact, the fast development of Large Language Models enhanced the interest in efficient solutions to process data over time. This survey provides an in-depth summary of the latest approaches that are based on recurrent models for sequential data processing. A complete taxonomy over the latest trends in architectural and algorithmic solutions is reported and discussed, guiding researchers in this appealing research field. The emerging picture suggests that there is room for thinking of novel routes, constituted by learning algorithms which depart from the standard Backpropagation Through Time, towards a more realistic scenario where patterns are effectively processed online, leveraging local-forward computations, opening to further research on this topic.">

        <tr id="Through integrating the evolutionary correlations across global states in the bidirectional recursion, an explainable Bayesian recurrent neural smoother (EBRNS) is proposed for offline data-assisted fixed-interval state smoothing. At first, the proposed model, containing global states in the evolutionary interval, is transformed into an equivalent model with bidirectional memory. This transformation incorporates crucial global state information with support for bi-directional recursive computation. For the transformed model, the joint state-memory-trend Bayesian filtering and smoothing frameworks are derived by introducing the bidirectional memory iteration mechanism and offline data into Bayesian estimation theory. The derived frameworks are implemented using the Gaussian approximation to ensure analytical properties and computational efficiency. Finally, the neural network modules within EBRNS and its two-stage training scheme are designed. Unlike most existing approaches that artificially combine deep learning and model-based estimation, the bidirectional recursion and internal gated structures of EBRNS are naturally derived from Bayesian estimation theory, explainably integrating prior model knowledge, online measurement, and offline data. Experiments on representative real-world datasets demonstrate that the high smoothing accuracy of EBRNS is accompanied by data efficiency and a lightweight parameter scale.">

 Data-driven methodologies have been used in reservoir management and production forecasting, particularly demonstrating remarkable efficacy in short-term oil production forecasts. However, there is space to improve its prediction, especially in tackling the complexities of challenging reservoirs, such as the heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs from Brazilian Pre-salt fields. Methods for oil production forecasting in the petroleum literature generally consider linear correlations or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this paper, we propose a new strategy to improve short-term forecasting for oil production through attention mechanisms that boost state-of-the-art methods. Traditional data-driven techniques generally do not consider static data or planned activities. However, we address this critical gap by leveraging the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) to integrate such information into our short-term forecasting. Transformers, the architectural inspiration behind ChatGPT, employ attention mechanisms to establish relationships between different time series data points, assigning weights to these connections. We jointly explore oil, gas, and water production, pressure, and the ratios between them. This method includes static data (e.g., geographical coordinates) as well as known side reservoir information. Such side information can be, for instance, another predicted future production or planned well shut-ins. We also investigate which side information improves the obtained forecasting. This paper presents two main findings. First, it shows how using certain side information can improve the overall predictive capability of a model. For example, using predicted gas production as side information can significantly improve the oil production forecast. This is logical and in line with expectations, as there is an intimate connection between oil and gas production. In the second application of TFT, we considered well closures as the side information. We used an anomaly detection tool to identify well closures in the history period and converted it to usable side information for the TFT model. The distribution of these well closures is used as a guide to predict our target oil production. As we considered the distribution of well closures as side information, we framed our results in terms of cumulative oil production rather than daily forecast rates. The results of this work show that the cumulative production gets very close to the ground-truth data, better than linear and proposed baselines. In summary, the second key result shows and underscores the significance of incorporating side information within our TFT approach.">

        <tr id="Capturing long-term dependency from historical behaviors is the key to the success of sequential recommendation; however, existing methods focus on extracting global sequential information while neglecting to obtain deep representations from subsequences. Previous research has revealed that the restricted inter-item transfer is fundamental to sequential modeling, and some potential substructures of sequences can help models learn more effective long-term dependency compared to the whole sequence. To automatically find better subsequences and perform efficient learning, we propose a sequential recommendation model with a gated recurrent unit and Transformers, abbreviated as GAT4Rec, which employs Transformers with shared parameters across layers to model users’ historical interaction sequences. The representation learned by the gated recurrent unit is used as the gating signal to identify the optimal substructure in user sequences. The fused representation of the subsequence and edge information is extracted by the encoding layer to make the corresponding recommendations. Experimental results on four well-known publicly available datasets demonstrate that our GAT4Rec model outperforms other recommendation models, achieving performance improvements of 5.77%, 1.35%, 11.58%, and 1.79% in the normalized discounted cumulative gain metric (NDCG@10), respectively.">

The recent success of state-space models (SSMs), a subclass of RNNs, to overcome such difficulties challenges our theoretical understanding. In this paper, we delve into the optimization challenges of RNNs and discover that, as the memory of a network increases, changes in its parameters result in increasingly large output variations, making gradient-based learning highly sensitive, even without exploding gradients. Our analysis further reveals the importance of the element-wise recurrence design pattern combined with careful parametrizations in mitigating this effect. This feature is present in SSMs, as well as in other architectures, such as LSTMs. Overall, our insights provide a new explanation for some of the difficulties in gradient-based learning of RNNs and why some architectures perform better than others.">

        <tr id="Traffic flow prediction is considered to be one of the fundamental technologies in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) with a tremendous application prospect. Unlike traditional time series analysis tasks, the key challenge in traffic flow prediction lies in effectively modelling the highly complex and dynamic spatiotemporal dependencies within the traffic data. In recent years, researchers have proposed various methods to enhance the accuracy of traffic flow prediction, but certain issues still persist. For instance, some methods rely on specific static assumptions, failing to adequately simulate the dynamic changes in the data, thus limiting their modelling capacity. On the other hand, some approaches inadequately capture the spatiotemporal dependencies, resulting in the omission of crucial information and leading to unsatisfactory prediction outcomes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a model called the Dynamic Spatial–Temporal Self-Attention Network (DSTSAN). Firstly, this research enhances the interaction between different dimension features in the traffic data through a feature augmentation module, thereby improving the model’s representational capacity. Subsequently, the current investigation introduces two masking matrices: one captures local spatial dependencies and the other captures global spatial dependencies, based on the spatial self-attention module. Finally, the methodology employs a temporal self-attention module to capture and integrate the dynamic temporal dependencies of traffic data. We designed experiments using historical data from the previous hour to predict traffic flow conditions in the hour ahead, and the experiments were extensively compared to the DSTSAN model, with 11 baseline methods using four real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.">

        <tr id="Computational methods in biology can infer large molecular interaction networks from multiple data sources and at different resolutions, creating unprecedented opportunities to explore the mechanisms driving complex biological phenomena. Networks can be built to represent distinct conditions and compared to uncover graph-level differences—such as when comparing patterns of gene-gene interactions that change between biological states. Given the importance of the graph comparison problem, there is a clear and growing need for robust and scalable methods that can identify meaningful differences. We introduce node2vec2rank (n2v2r), a method for graph differential analysis that ranks nodes according to the disparities of their representations in joint latent embedding spaces. Improving upon previous bag-of-features approaches, we take advantage of recent advances in machine learning and statistics to compare graphs in higher-order structures and in a data-driven manner. Formulated as a multi-layer spectral embedding algorithm, n2v2r is computationally efficient, incorporates stability as a key feature, and can provably identify the correct ranking of differences between graphs in an overall procedure that adheres to veridical data science principles. By better adapting to the data, node2vec2rank clearly outperformed the commonly used node degree in finding complex differences in simulated data. In the real-world applications of breast cancer subtype characterization, analysis of cell cycle in single-cell data, and searching for sex differences in lung adenocarcinoma, node2vec2rank found meaningful biological differences enabling the hypothesis generation for therapeutic candidates. Software and analysis pipelines implementing n2v2r and used for the analyses presented here are publicly available.">

Furthermore, we enrich the representation of the features by utilizing a multi-head approach when creating the internal relationship graph. Compared with traditional multi-head approaches, we propose a more efficient convolution-based multi-head mechanism, which only requires 56% of model parameters compared with the best multi-head baseline as demonstrated in the experiments.

To solve these problems, we propose a novel architecture, XGNN, which combines the advantages of XGBoost and GNNs to deal with heterogeneous features and graph structures.

Although many different approaches to time series synthesis have been proposed, evaluating the quality of synthetic time series data poses unique challenges and remains an open problem, as there is a lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a “good” synthesis. To this end, we present a comprehensive literature survey to identify different aspects of synthesis quality and their relationships.

The distributions, which we use to form our prior and variational posterior, are induced by a projection operation, whereby an arbitrary continuous distribution is projected onto the space of sparse weighted acyclic adjacency matrices (matrix representations of DAGs) with probability mass on exact zeros. Though the projection constitutes a combinatorial optimization problem, it is solvable at scale via recently developed techniques that reformulate acyclicity as a continuous constraint.

        <tr id="Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNN) have the ability to capture both the graph topology and dynamic dependencies of interactions within a graph over time. There has been a growing need to explain the predictions of TGNN models due to the difficulty in identifying how past events influence their predictions. Since the explanation model for a static graph cannot be readily applied to temporal graphs due to its inability to capture temporal dependencies, recent studies proposed explanation models for temporal graphs. However, existing explanation models for temporal graphs rely on post-hoc explanations, requiring separate models for prediction and explanation, which is limited in two aspects: efficiency and accuracy of explanation. In this work, we propose a novel built-in explanation framework for temporal graphs, called Self-Explainable Temporal Graph Networks based on Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). TGIB provides explanations for event occurrences by introducing stochasticity in each temporal event based on the Information Bottleneck theory. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of TGIB in terms of both the link prediction performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. This is the first work that simultaneously performs prediction and explanation for temporal graphs in an end-to-end manner.">
