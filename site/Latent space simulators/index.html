        <tr id="Small integration time steps limit molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to millisecond time scales. Markov state models (MSMs) and equation-free approaches learn low-dimensional kinetic models from MD simulation data by performing configurational or dynamical coarse-graining of the state space. The learned kinetic models enable the efficient generation of dynamical trajectories over vastly longer time scales than are accessible by MD, but the discretization of configurational space and/or absence of a means to reconstruct molecular configurations precludes the generation of continuous atomistic molecular trajectories. We propose latent space simulators (LSS) to learn kinetic models for continuous atomistic simulation trajectories by training three deep learning networks to (i) learn the slow collective variables of the molecular system, (ii) propagate the system dynamics within this slow latent space, and (iii) generatively reconstruct molecular configurations. We demonstrate the approach in an application to Trp-cage miniprotein to produce novel ultra-long synthetic folding trajectories that accurately reproduce atomistic molecular structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics at six orders of magnitude lower cost than MD. The dramatically lower cost of trajectory generation enables greatly improved sampling and greatly reduced statistical uncertainties in estimated thermodynamic averages and kinetic rates.">

        <tr id="Numerical approximation methods for the Koopman operator have advanced considerably in the last few years. In particular, data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)51 and its generalization, the extended-DMD (EDMD), are becoming increasingly popular in practical applications. The EDMD improves upon the classical DMD by the inclusion of a flexible choice of dictionary of observables which spans a finite dimensional subspace on which the Koopman operator can be approximated. This enhances the accuracy of the solution reconstruction and broadens the applicability of the Koopman formalism. Although the convergence of the EDMD has been established, applying the method in practice requires a careful choice of the observables to improve convergence with just a finite number of terms. This is especially difficult for high dimensional and highly nonlinear systems. In this paper, we employ ideas from machine learning to improve upon the EDMD method. We develop an iterative approximation algorithm which couples the EDMD with a trainable dictionary represented by an artificial neural network. Using the Duffing oscillator and the Kuramoto Sivashinsky partical differential equation as examples, we show that our algorithm can effectively and efficiently adapt the trainable dictionary to the problem at hand to achieve good reconstruction accuracy without the need to choose a fixed dictionary a priori. Furthermore, to obtain a given accuracy, we require fewer dictionary terms than EDMD with fixed dictionaries. This alleviates an important shortcoming of the EDMD algorithm and enhances the applicability of the Koopman framework to practical problems.">

        <tr id="The success of enhanced sampling molecular simulations that accelerate along collective variables (CVs) is predicated on the availability of variables coincident with the slow collective motions governing the long-time conformational dynamics of a system. It is challenging to intuit these slow CVs for all but the simplest molecular systems, and their data-driven discovery directly from molecular simulation trajectories has been a central focus of the molecular simulation community to both unveil the important physical mechanisms and drive enhanced sampling. In this work, we introduce state-free reversible VAMPnets (SRV) as a deep learning architecture that learns nonlinear CV approximants to the leading slow eigenfunctions of the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator that evolves equilibrium-scaled probability distributions through time. Orthogonality of the learned CVs is naturally imposed within network training without added regularization. The CVs are inherently explicit and differentiable functions of the input coordinates making them well-suited to use in enhanced sampling calculations. We demonstrate the utility of SRVs in capturing parsimonious nonlinear representations of complex system dynamics in applications to 1D and 2D toy systems where the true eigenfunctions are exactly calculable and to molecular dynamics simulations of alanine dipeptide and the WW domain protein.">

        <tr id="The Koopman operator has entered and transformed many research areas over the last years. Although the underlying concept$\unicode{x2013}$representing highly nonlinear dynamical systems by infinite-dimensional linear operators$\unicode{x2013}$has been known for a long time, the availability of large data sets and efficient machine learning algorithms for estimating the Koopman operator from data make this framework extremely powerful and popular.

This paper introduces a fast and interpretable method for approximating the committor, called the"fast committor machine"(FCM). The FCM is based on simulated trajectory data, and it uses this data to train a kernel model. The FCM identifies low-dimensional subspaces that optimally describe the $A$ to $B$ transitions, and the subspaces are emphasized in the kernel model. The FCM uses randomized numerical linear algebra to train the model with runtime that scales linearly in the number of data points. This paper applies the FCM to example systems including the alanine dipeptide miniprotein: in these experiments, the FCM is generally more accurate and trains more quickly than a neural network with a similar number of parameters.">

Common features of these systems are that their behaviors are difficult to describe exactly and invariably unmodeled dynamics present challenges in making precise predictions. In many cases the models exhibit extremely complicated behavior due to bifurcations and chaotic regimes. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven linear estimator that uses Koopman operator theory to extract finite-dimensional representations of complex nonlinear systems. The extracted model is used together with a deep reinforcement learning network that learns the optimal stepwise actions to predict future states of the original nonlinear system. Our estimator is also adaptive to a diffeomorphic transformation of the nonlinear system which enables transfer learning to compute state estimates of the transformed system without relearning from scratch.">

We also propose practical criteria for AIGLE to enforce long-term dynamical consistency.

        <tr id="An issue for molecular dynamics simulations is that events of interest often involve timescales that are much longer than the simulation time step, which is set by the fastest timescales of the model. Because of this timescale separation, direct simulation of many events is prohibitively computationally costly. This issue can be overcome by aggregating information from many relatively short simulations that sample segments of trajectories involving events of interest. This is the strategy of Markov state models (MSMs) and related approaches, but such methods suffer from approximation error because the variables defining the states generally do not capture the dynamics fully. By contrast, once converged, the weighted ensemble (WE) method aggregates information from trajectory segments so as to yield unbiased estimates of both thermodynamic and kinetic statistics. Unfortunately, errors decay no faster than unbiased simulation in WE. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for describing WE that shows that introduction of an element of stratification, as in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS), accelerates convergence. Then, building on ideas from MSMs and related methods, we propose an improved stratification that allows approximation error to be reduced systematically. We show that the improved stratification can decrease simulation times required to achieve a desired precision by orders of magnitude.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modelling techniques provide a method for deriving models of dynamical systems directly from complicated data streams. However, tracking and forecasting such data streams poses a significant challenge to most methods, as they assume the underlying process and model does not change over time. In this paper, we apply one such data-driven method, the Koopman autoencoder (KAE), to high-dimensional oscillatory data to generate a low-dimensional latent space and model, where the system's dynamics appear linear. This allows one to accurately track and forecast systems where the underlying model may change over time. States and the model in the reduced order latent space can then be efficiently updated as new data becomes available, using data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), in a technique we call the KAE EnKF. We demonstrate that this approach is able to effectively track and forecast time-varying, nonlinear dynamical systems in synthetic examples. We then apply the KAE EnKF to a video of a physical pendulum, and achieve a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. By generating effective latent space reconstructions, we find that we are able to construct accurate short-term forecasts and efficient adaptations to externally forced changes to the pendulum's frequency.">

        <tr id="We introduce the Rigged Dynamic Mode Decomposition (Rigged DMD) algorithm, which computes generalized eigenfunction decompositions of Koopman operators. By considering the evolution of observables, Koopman operators transform complex nonlinear dynamics into a linear framework suitable for spectral analysis. While powerful, traditional Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) techniques often struggle with continuous spectra. Rigged DMD addresses these challenges with a data-driven methodology that approximates the Koopman operator's resolvent and its generalized eigenfunctions using snapshot data from the system's evolution. At its core, Rigged DMD builds wave-packet approximations for generalized Koopman eigenfunctions and modes by integrating Measure-Preserving Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with high-order kernels for smoothing. This provides a robust decomposition encompassing both discrete and continuous spectral elements. We derive explicit high-order convergence theorems for generalized eigenfunctions and spectral measures. Additionally, we propose a novel framework for constructing rigged Hilbert spaces using time-delay embedding, significantly extending the algorithm's applicability. We provide examples, including systems with a Lebesgue spectrum, integrable Hamiltonian systems, the Lorenz system, and a high-Reynolds number lid-driven flow in a two-dimensional square cavity, demonstrating Rigged DMD's convergence, efficiency, and versatility. This work paves the way for future research and applications of decompositions with continuous spectra.">

        <tr id="Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.">

KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP.

Increasingly, expressive function approximators like neural networks and tensor networks have shown promise in computing the central object of TPT, the committor function, even in very high dimensional systems. That progress prompts our consideration of how one could use such a high dimensional function to extract mechanistic insight. Here, we present and illustrate a straightforward but powerful way to track how individual dynamical coordinates evolve during a reactive event. The strategy, which involves marginalizing the reactive ensemble, naturally captures the evolution of the dynamical coordinate's distribution, not just its mean reactive behavior.">

        <tr id="Intrinsically disordered proteins have dynamic structures through which they play key biological roles. The elucidation of their conformational ensembles is a challenging problem requiring an integrated use of computational and experimental methods. Molecular simulations are a valuable computational strategy for constructing structural ensembles of disordered proteins but are highly resource-intensive. Recently, machine learning approaches based on deep generative models that learn from simulation data have emerged as an efficient alternative for generating structural ensembles. However, such methods currently suffer from limited transferability when modeling sequences and conformations absent in the training data. Here, we develop a novel generative model that achieves high levels of transferability for intrinsically disordered protein ensembles. The approach, named idpSAM, is a latent diffusion model based on transformer neural networks. It combines an autoencoder to learn a representation of protein geometry and a diffusion model to sample novel conformations in the encoded space. IdpSAM was trained on a large dataset of simulations of disordered protein regions performed with the ABSINTH implicit solvent model. Thanks to the expressiveness of its neural networks and its training stability, idpSAM faithfully captures 3D structural ensembles of test sequences with no similarity in the training set. Our study also demonstrates the potential for generating full conformational ensembles from datasets with limited sampling and underscores the importance of training set size for generalization. We believe that idpSAM represents a significant progress in transferable protein ensemble modeling through machine learning.">

To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

        <tr id="Proteins are inherently dynamic, and their conformational ensembles are functionally important in biology. Large-scale motions may govern protein structure–function relationship, and numerous transient but stable conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can play a crucial role in biological function. Investigating conformational ensembles to understand regulations and disease-related aggregations of IDPs is challenging both experimentally and computationally. In this paper first an unsupervised deep learning-based model, termed Internal Coordinate Net (ICoN), is developed that learns the physical principles of conformational changes from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Second, interpolating data points in the learned latent space are selected that rapidly identify novel synthetic conformations with sophisticated and large-scale sidechains and backbone arrangements. Third, with the highly dynamic amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ42) monomer, our deep learning model provided a comprehensive sampling of Aβ42’s conformational landscape. Analysis of these synthetic conformations revealed conformational clusters that can be used to rationalize experimental findings. Additionally, the method can identify novel conformations with important interactions in atomistic details that are not included in the training data. New synthetic conformations showed distinct sidechain rearrangements that are probed by our EPR and amino acid substitution studies. The proposed approach is highly transferable and can be used for any available data for training. The work also demonstrated the ability for deep learning to utilize learned natural atomistic motions in protein conformation sampling.">

In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.">

The approach consists in the construction of a deep neural network model that approximates the solution manifold through a continuously adaptive local basis. In contrast to global methods, such as Principal Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), the adaptivity allows the DOD to overcome the Kolmogorov barrier, making the approach applicable to a wide spectrum of parametric problems. Furthermore, due to its hybrid linear-nonlinear nature, the DOD can accommodate both intrusive and nonintrusive techniques, providing highly interpretable latent representations and tighter control on error propagation. For this reason, the proposed approach stands out as a valuable alternative to other nonlinear techniques, such as deep autoencoders. The methodology is discussed both theoretically and practically, evaluating its performances on problems featuring nonlinear PDEs, singularities, and parametrized geometries.">

We derive equations for the holding times of these macrostates and demonstrate their consistency with the classical definition. Furthermore, we discuss the application of the ISOKANN method for learning these quantities from simulation data.

In this study, we demonstrate that the transformer, a machine learning model renowned for machine translation and natural language processing, can be effectively adapted to learn the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectory of biologically relevant physicochemical systems. Specifically, by using sequences of time-discretized states from MD trajectories as input, we show that a transformer can learn the complex syntactic and semantic relationships within the trajectory. This enables it to generate kinetically accurate sequences of future states for a diverse set of models and biomolecules of varying complexity. Remarkably, the transformer-based model can predict future states much faster than traditional MD simulations. We show that it is particularly adept at forecasting the time evolution of an out-of-equilibrium active system that do not maintain detailed balance. We demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism inherent in transformers is crucial for capturing the long-range correlations necessary for accurate state-to-state transition predictions. Overall, our results highlight the ability of transformer based machine learning model in generating future states of physicochemical systems with statistical accuracy.">

However, at low temperature, when directly solving a stationary Fokker-Planck equation with more than two metastable states in the generalized potential landscape, the small eigenvalue introduces numerical difficulties due to a large condition number. To overcome these problems, we introduce the IGANN method, which uses a penalty of negative input gradient annealing during the training.

        <tr id="We present a differentiable formalism for learning free energies that is capable of capturing arbitrarily complex model dependencies on coarse-grained coordinates and finite-temperature response to variation of general system parameters. This is done by endowing models with explicit dependence on temperature and parameters and by exploiting exact differential thermodynamic relationships between the free energy, ensemble averages, and response properties. Formally, we derive an approach for learning high-dimensional cumulant generating functions using statistical estimates of their derivatives, which are observable cumulants of the underlying random variable. The proposed formalism opens ways to resolve several outstanding challenges in bottom-up molecular coarse graining dealing with multiple minima and state dependence. This is realized by using additional differential relationships in the loss function to significantly improve the learning of free energies, while exactly preserving the Boltzmann distribution governing the corresponding fine-grain all-atom system. As an example, we go beyond the standard force-matching procedure to demonstrate how leveraging the thermodynamic relationship between free energy and values of ensemble averaged all-atom potential energy improves the learning efficiency and accuracy of the free energy model. The result is significantly better sampling statistics of structural distribution functions. The theoretical framework presented here is demonstrated via implementations in both kernel-based and neural network machine learning regression methods and opens new ways to train accurate machine learning models for studying thermodynamic and response properties of complex molecular systems.">

In this study, we focus on the development of such metrics for viscoelastic fluid flows governed by a large class of linear and nonlinear stress models. To do this, we introduce a kernel function corresponding to a given viscoelastic stress model that implicitly embeds flowfield snapshots into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) whose squared norm equals the total mechanical energy. Working implicitly with lifted representations in the RKHS via the kernel function provides natural and unambiguous metrics for distances and angles between flowfields without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we present a solution to the preimage problem for our kernels, enabling accurate reconstruction of flowfields from their RKHS representations. Through numerical experiments on an unsteady viscoelastic lid-driven cavity flow, we demonstrate the utility of our kernels for extracting energetically-dominant coherent structures in viscoelastic flows across a range of Reynolds and Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, the features extracted by Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) of flowfield snapshots using our kernel functions yield reconstructions with superior accuracy in terms of mechanical energy compared to conventional methods such as ordinary Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with na\"ively-defined state vectors or KPCA with ad-hoc choices of kernel functions.

While drug residence time is just as important as binding affinity, atomiclevel understanding of drug residence times through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been difficult primarily due to the extremely long timescales. Recent advances in rare event sampling have allowed us to reach these timescales, yet predicting protein-ligand residence times remains a significant challenge. Here we present a semi-automated protocol to calculate the ligand residence times across 12 orders of magnitudes of timescales. In our proposed framework, we integrate a deep learning-based method, the state predictive information bottleneck (SPIB), to learn an approximate reaction coordinate (RC) and use it to guide the enhanced sampling method metadynamics. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by applying it to six different protein-ligand complexes with available benchmark residence times, including the dissociation of the widely studied anti-cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) from both wild-type Abl kinase and drug-resistant mutants. We show how our protocol can recover quantitatively accurate residence times, potentially opening avenues for deeper insights into drug development possibilities and ligand recognition mechanisms.

First, we propose the decoder decomposition, which is a post-processing method to connect the latent variables to the coherent structures of flows.

We find that the dimension of latent space has a significant impact on the interpretability of autoencoders. We identify the physical and spurious latent variables. Third, we apply the decoder decomposition to the latent space of wind-tunnel experimental data of a three-dimensional turbulent wake past a bluff body. We show that the reconstruction error is a function of both the latent space dimension and the decoder size, which are correlated. Finally, we apply the decoder decomposition to rank and select latent variables based on the coherent structures that they represent. This is useful to filter unwanted or spurious latent variables, or to pinpoint specific coherent structures of interest.

Existing methods aim to reconstruct STTD using low-dimensional models. However, they are limited to data-specific dimensions or source-dependent patterns, restricting them from unifying representations. Here, we present a novel paradigm to address the STTD learning problem by parameterizing STTD as an implicit neural representation. To discern the underlying dynamics in low-dimensional regimes, coordinate-based neural networks that can encode high-frequency structures are employed to directly map coordinates to traffic variables. To unravel the entangled spatial-temporal interactions, the variability is decomposed into separate processes. We further enable modeling in irregular spaces such as sensor graphs using spectral embedding. Through continuous representations, our approach enables the modeling of a variety of STTD with a unified input, thereby serving as a generalized learner of the underlying traffic dynamics. It is also shown that it can learn implicit low-rank priors and smoothness regularization from the data, making it versatile for learning different dominating data patterns. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments in real-world scenarios, showcasing applications from corridor to network scales. Empirical results not only indicate that our model has significant superiority over conventional low-rank models, but also highlight that the versatility of the approach extends to different data domains, output resolutions, and network topologies. Comprehensive model analyses provide further insight into the inductive bias of STTD. We anticipate that this pioneering modeling perspective could lay the foundation for universal representation of STTD in various real-world tasks.">

It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

        <tr id="Single-molecule experiments provide insight into the motion (conformational dynamics) of individual protein molecules. Usually, a well-defined but coarse-grained intramolecular coordinate is measured and subsequently analysed with the help of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to deduce the kinetics of protein conformational changes. Such approaches rely on the assumption that the microscopic dynamics of the protein evolve according to a Markov-jump process on some network. However, the manifestation and extent of memory in the dynamics of the observable strongly depends on the chosen underlying Markov model, which is generally not known and therefore can lead to misinterpretations. Here, we combine extensive single-molecule plasmon ruler experiments on the heat shock protein Hsp90, computer simulations, and theory to infer and quantify memory in a model-free fashion. Our analysis is based on the bare definition of non-Markovian behaviour and does not require any underlying model. In the case of Hsp90 probed by a plasmon ruler, the Markov assumption is found to be clearly and conclusively violated on timescales up to roughly 50 s, which corresponds roughly to $\sim$50% of the inferred correlation time of the signal. The extent of memory is striking and reaches biologically relevant timescales. This implies that memory effects penetrate even the slowest observed motions. We provide clear and reproducible guidelines on how to test for the presence and duration of memory in experimental single-molecule data.">

This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go. NKDCD also utilizes sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights of the lag matrices, encouraging the model to select only the needed causal dependencies within the data. Through extensive testing on practically applicable datasets, it is shown that the NKDCD outperforms the existing nonlinear Granger causality discovery approaches.">

        <tr id="Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

Recently, recurrent switching dynamical systems have been used to tackle the scale and complexity of these data. However, an important challenge remains in providing insights into the existence and structure of recurrent linear dynamics in neural time series data. Here we test a scalable approach to time-varying autoregression with low-rank tensors to recover the recurrent dynamics in stochastic neural mass models with multiple stable attractors. We demonstrate that the sparse representation of time-varying system matrices in terms of temporal modes can recover the attractor structure of simple systems via clustering. We then consider simulations based on a human brain connectivity matrix in high and low global connection strength regimes, and reveal the hierarchical clustering structure of the dynamics. Finally, we explain the impact of the forecast time delay on the estimation of the underlying rank and temporal variability of the time series dynamics. This study illustrates that prediction error minimization is not sufficient to recover meaningful dynamic structure and that it is crucial to account for the three key timescales arising from dynamics, noise processes, and attractor switching.">

Previous work on disentangled representation learning within the realm of dynamical systems focused on the latent states, possibly with linear transition approximations. As such, they cannot identify nonlinear transition dynamics, and hence fail to reliably predict complex future behavior. Inspired by the advances in nonlinear ICA, we propose a state-space modeling framework in which we can identify not just the latent states but also the unknown transition function that maps the past states to the present. We introduce a practical algorithm based on variational auto-encoders and empirically demonstrate in realistic synthetic settings that we can (i) recover latent state dynamics with high accuracy, (ii) correspondingly achieve high future prediction accuracy, and (iii) adapt fast to new environments.">

        <tr id="Computational modeling of assembly is challenging for many systems because their timescales vastly exceed those accessible to simulations. This article describes the MultiMSM, which is a general framework that uses Markov state models (MSMs) to enable simulating self-assembly and self-organization on timescales that are orders of magnitude longer than those accessible to brute force dynamics simulations. In contrast to previous MSM approaches to simulating assembly, the framework describes simultaneous assembly of many clusters and the consequent depletion of free subunits or other small oligomers. The algorithm accounts for changes in transition rates as concentrations of monomers and intermediates evolve over the course of the reaction. Using two model systems, we show that the MultiMSM accurately predicts the concentrations of the full ensemble of intermediates on the long timescales required for reactions to reach equilibrium. Importantly, after constructing a MultiMSM for one system concentration, a wide range of other concentrations can be simulated without any further sampling. This capability allows for orders of magnitude additional speed up. In addition, the method enables highly efficient calculation of quantities such as free energy profiles, nucleation timescales, flux along the ensemble of assembly pathways, and entropy production rates. Identifying contributions of individual transitions to entropy production rates reveals sources of kinetic traps. The method is broadly applicable to systems with equilibrium or nonequilibrium dynamics, and is trivially parallelizable and thus highly scalable.">

We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.">

Neural networks such as autoencoders are effective to reduce the dimension of non-stationary flow, but their larger storage requirements compared to POD and DMD compromise the expectations on ROM. The present work aims at compressing the autoencoder model via two distinctively different approaches, i.e., pruning and singular value decomposition (SVD). The developed algorithm is then applied to reconstruct the flow fields of typical stationary (i.e., a laminar cylinder flow and two turbulent channel flows) and non-stationary (i.e., a laminar co-rotating vortex pair) examples. It is shown that pruning and SVD reduce the size of the autoencoder network to 6% and 3% for the two simple laminar cases (or 18% and 13%, 20%, and 10% for the two complex turbulent channel flow cases), respectively, with approximately the same order of accuracy. Therefore, the proposed autoencoders optimized by the network pruning and SVD lead to effective ROM of both stationary and non-stationary flows although they require more iterations to converge than conventional methods.">

We optimize a normalizing flow model to successfully transform high-temperature configurations of a dense liquid into low-temperature ones, near the glass transition. We perform a detailed comparative analysis with established enhanced sampling techniques developed in the physics literature to assess and rank the performance of normalizing flows against state-of-the-art algorithms. We demonstrate that machine learning methods are very promising, showing a large speedup over conventional molecular dynamics. Normalizing flows show performances comparable to parallel tempering and population annealing, while still falling far behind the swap Monte Carlo algorithm.

Due to this, molecular dynamics serves as a powerful tool to study this phenomenon. Existing approaches to study the mechanism often focus analysis on static snapshots of the global configuration, potentially overlooking subtle local fluctuations and history of the atoms involved in the formation of solid nuclei. To address this limitation, we propose a methodology that categorizes nucleation pathways into reactive pathways based on the time evolution of constituent atoms. Our approach effectively captures the diverse structural pathways explored by crystallizing Lennard-Jones-like particles and solidifying Ni$_3$Al, providing a more nuanced understanding of nucleating pathways. Moreover, our methodology enables the prediction of the resulting polymorph from each reactive trajectory.

        <tr id="Thanks to their simple architecture, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting interpretable insights from data. However, training RBMs, as other energy-based models, on highly structured data poses a major challenge, as effective training relies on mixing the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations used to estimate the gradient. This process is often hindered by multiple second-order phase transitions and the associated critical slowdown. In this paper, we present an innovative method in which the principal directions of the dataset are integrated into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization procedure. This approach enables efficient sampling of the equilibrium measure via a static Monte Carlo process. By starting the standard training process with a model that already accurately represents the main modes of the data, we bypass the initial phase transitions. Our results show that this strategy successfully trains RBMs to capture the full diversity of data in datasets where previous methods fail. Furthermore, we use the training trajectories to propose a new sampling method, {\em parallel trajectory tempering}, which allows us to sample the equilibrium measure of the trained model much faster than previous optimized MCMC approaches and a better estimation of the log-likelihood. We illustrate the success of the training method on several highly structured datasets.">

        <tr id="Understanding transition paths between meta-stable states in molecular systems is fundamental for material design and drug discovery. However, sampling these paths via molecular dynamics simulations is computationally prohibitive due to the high-energy barriers between the meta-stable states. Recent machine learning approaches are often restricted to simple systems or rely on collective variables (CVs) extracted from expensive domain knowledge. In this work, we propose to leverage generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to sample transition paths without relying on CVs. We reformulate the problem as amortized energy-based sampling over molecular trajectories and train a bias potential by minimizing the squared log-ratio between the target distribution and the generator, derived from the flow matching objective of GFlowNets. Our evaluation on three proteins (Alanine Dipeptide, Polyproline, and Chignolin) demonstrates that our approach, called TPS-GFN, generates more realistic and diverse transition paths than the previous CV-free machine learning approach.">

To this end, our proposed solution has two main advantages. First, the proposed method only requires the measurement noise to be bounded. Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks.

Here, we explore the idea of using internal chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional chaotic systems as a way to generate new datapoints from a training dataset.

        <tr id="Extracting the relationship between high-dimensional recordings of neural activity and complex behav- ior is a ubiquitous problem in systems neuroscience. Toward this goal, encoding and decoding models attempt to infer the conditional distribution of neural activity given behavior and vice versa, while dimensionality reduc- tion techniques aim to extract interpretable low-dimensional representations. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are flexible deep-learning models commonly used to infer low-dimensional embeddings of neural or behavioral data. However, it is challenging for VAEs to accurately model arbitrary conditional distributions, such as those encountered in neural encoding and decoding, and even more so simultaneously. Here, we present a VAE-based approach for accurately calculating such conditional distributions. We validate our approach on a task with known ground truth and demonstrate the applicability to high-dimensional behavioral time series by retrieving the condi- tional distributions over masked body parts of walking flies. Finally, we probabilistically decode motor trajectories from neural population activity in a monkey reach task and query the same VAE for the encoding distribution of neural activity given behavior. Our approach provides a unifying perspective on joint dimensionality reduction and learning conditional distributions of neural and behavioral data, which will allow for scaling common analyses in neuroscience to today’s high-dimensional multi-modal datasets.">

It has broad applications in fields such as Bayesian inference, financial mathematics, control theory, and shape analysis. However, simulating the diffusion bridge for natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain unresolved. In the paper, we present a solution to this problem by merging score-matching techniques with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to score-matching for the infinite-dimensional bridge. We construct the score to be discretization invariant, which is natural given the underlying spatially continuous process. We conduct a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data, and our method demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution without extra training.">

        <tr id="Molecular relaxation, finding the equilibrium state of a non-equilibrium structure, is an essential component of computational chemistry to understand reactivity. Classical force field methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network force field models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface instead of the complex physical potential energy surface. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical force fields, equivariant neural network force fields trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their DFT energies.">

        <tr id="Representation learning for the electronic structure problem is a major challenge of machine learning in computational condensed matter and materials physics. Within quantum mechanical first principles approaches, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is the preeminent tool for understanding electronic structure, and the high-dimensional wavefunctions calculated in this approach serve as the building block for downstream calculations of correlated many-body excitations and related physical observables. Here, we use variational autoencoders (VAE) for the unsupervised learning of high-dimensional DFT wavefunctions and show that these wavefunctions lie in a low-dimensional manifold within the latent space. Our model autonomously determines the optimal representation of the electronic structure, avoiding limitations due to manual feature engineering and selection in prior work. To demonstrate the utility of the latent space representation of the DFT wavefunction, we use it for the supervised training of neural networks (NN) for downstream prediction of the quasiparticle bandstructures within the GW formalism, which includes many-electron correlations beyond DFT. The GW prediction achieves a low error of 0.11 eV for a combined test set of metals and semiconductors drawn from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), suggesting that latent space representation captures key physical information from the original data. Finally, we explore the interpretability of the VAE representation and show that the successful representation learning and downstream prediction by our model is derived from the smoothness of the VAE latent space, which also enables the generation of wavefunctions on arbitrary points in latent space. Our work provides a novel and general machine-learning framework for investigating electronic structure and many-body physics.">

This paper introduces an innovative Autoencoder-based Dataset Condensation Model backed by Koopman operator theory that effectively packs large datasets into compact, information-rich representations. Inspired by the predictive coding mechanisms of the human brain, our model leverages a novel approach to encode and reconstruct data, maintaining essential features and label distributions. The condensation process utilizes an autoencoder neural network architecture, coupled with Optimal Transport theory and Wasserstein distance, to minimize the distributional discrepancies between the original and synthesized datasets. We present a two-stage implementation strategy: first, condensing the large dataset into a smaller synthesized subset; second, evaluating the synthesized data by training a classifier and comparing its performance with a classifier trained on an equivalent subset of the original data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the classifiers trained on condensed data exhibit comparable performance to those trained on the original datasets, thus affirming the efficacy of our condensation model. This work not only contributes to the reduction of computational resources but also paves the way for efficient data handling in constrained environments, marking a significant step forward in data-efficient machine learning.">

        <tr id="One of the central goals of neuroscience is to gain a mechanistic understanding of how the dynamics of neural circuits give rise to their observed function. A popular approach towards this end is to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to reproduce experimental recordings of neural activity. These trained RNNs are then treated as surrogate models of biological neural circuits, whose properties can be dissected via dynamical systems analysis. How reliable are the mechanistic insights derived from this procedure? While recent advances in population-level recording technologies have allowed simultaneous recording of up to tens of thousands of neurons, this represents only a tiny fraction of most cortical circuits. Here we show that observing only a subset of neurons in a circuit can create mechanistic mismatches between a simulated teacher network and a data-constrained student, even when the two networks have matching single-unit dynamics. In particular, partial observation of models of low-dimensional cortical dynamics based on functionally feedforward or low-rank connectivity can lead to surrogate models with spurious attractor structure. Our results illustrate the challenges inherent in accurately uncovering neural mechanisms from single-trial data, and suggest the need for new methods of validating data-constrained models for neural dynamics.">

        <tr id="Conformational heterogeneity of biological macromolecules is a challenge in single particle averaging (SPA). Current standard practice is to employ classification and filtering methods which may allow a discrete number of conformational states to be reconstructed. However, the conformation space accessible to these molecules is continuous and therefore explored incompletely by a small number of discrete classes. Recently developed heterogeneous reconstruction algorithms (HRAs) to analyse continuous heterogeneity rely on machine learning methods employing low-dimensional latent space representations. The non-linear nature of many of these methods pose challenges to their validation and interpretation, and to identifying functionally relevant conformational trajectories. We believe these methods would benefit from in-depth benchmarking using high quality synthetic data and concomitant ground truth information. Here we present a framework for the simulation and subsequent analysis with respect to ground-truth of cryo-EM micrographs containing conformationally heterogeneous particles whose conformational heterogeneity is sourced from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This synthetic data can then be processed as if it were experimental data allowing aspects of standard SPA workflows, as well as heterogeneous reconstruction methods, to be compared with known groundtruth using available utilities.

        <tr id="Finding low-dimensional interpretable models of complex physical fields such as turbulence remains an open question, 80 years after the pioneer work of Kolmogorov. Estimating high-dimensional probability distributions from data samples suffers from an optimization and an approximation curse of dimensionality. It may be avoided by following a hierarchic probability flow from coarse to fine scales. This inverse renormalization group is defined by conditional probabilities across scales, renormalized in a wavelet basis. For a $\varphi^4$ scalar potential, sampling these hierarchic models avoids the critical slowing down at the phase transition. An outstanding issue is to also approximate non-Gaussian fields having long-range interactions in space and across scales. We introduce low-dimensional models with robust multiscale approximations of high order polynomial energies. They are calculated with a second wavelet transform, which defines interactions over two hierarchies of scales. We estimate and sample these wavelet scattering models to generate 2D vorticity fields of turbulence, and images of dark matter densities.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces alternators, a novel family of non-Markovian dynamical models for sequences. An alternator features two neural networks: the observation trajectory network (OTN) and the feature trajectory network (FTN). The OTN and the FTN work in conjunction, alternating between outputting samples in the observation space and some feature space, respectively, over a cycle. The parameters of the OTN and the FTN are not time-dependent and are learned via a minimum cross-entropy criterion over the trajectories. Alternators are versatile. They can be used as dynamical latent-variable generative models or as sequence-to-sequence predictors. When alternators are used as generative models, the FTN produces interpretable low-dimensional latent variables that capture the dynamics governing the observations. When alternators are used as sequence-to-sequence predictors, the FTN learns to predict the observed features. In both cases, the OTN learns to produce sequences that match the data. Alternators can uncover the latent dynamics underlying complex sequential data, accurately forecast and impute missing data, and sample new trajectories. We showcase the capabilities of alternators in three applications. We first used alternators to model the Lorenz equations, often used to describe chaotic behavior. We then applied alternators to Neuroscience, to map brain activity to physical activity. Finally, we applied alternators to Climate Science, focusing on sea-surface temperature forecasting. In all our experiments, we found alternators are stable to train, fast to sample from, yield high-quality generated samples and latent variables, and outperform strong baselines such as neural ODEs and diffusion models in the domains we studied.">

Recent advances have shown how to use random feature approximations to achieve scalable, online ensembling of Gaussian processes with desirable theoretical properties and fruitful applications. One key to these methods' success is the inclusion of a random walk on the model parameters, which makes models dynamic. We show that these methods can be generalized easily to any basis expansion model and that using alternative basis expansions, such as Hilbert space Gaussian processes, often results in better performance. To simplify the process of choosing a specific basis expansion, our method's generality also allows the ensembling of several entirely different models, for example, a Gaussian process and polynomial regression. Finally, we propose a novel method to ensemble static and dynamic models together.">

        <tr id="This study presents the extension of the data-driven optimal prediction approach to the dynamical system with control. The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction. We experimentally confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for two Hamiltonian dynamical systems.">

The excellent performance of our protocols is assessed against high-level coupled cluster calculations on a diverse set of representative configurations of the system. Finally, we train machine-learning force fields on the QMC forces and compare them to models trained on coupled cluster reference data, showing that a force field based on the diffusion Monte Carlo forces with a single determinant can faithfully reproduce coupled cluster power spectra in molecular dynamics simulations.">

        <tr id="Deep learning methods are increasingly becoming instrumental as modeling tools in computational neuroscience, employing optimality principles to build bridges between neural responses and perception or behavior. Developing models that adequately represent uncertainty is however challenging for deep learning methods, which often suffer from calibration problems. This constitutes a difficulty in particular when modeling cortical circuits in terms of Bayesian inference, beyond single point estimates such as the posterior mean or the maximum a posteriori. In this work we systematically studied uncertainty representations in latent representations of variational auto-encoders (VAEs), both in a perceptual task from natural images and in two other canonical tasks of computer vision, finding a poor alignment between uncertainty and informativeness or ambiguities in the images. We next showed how a novel approach which we call explaining-away variational auto-encoders (EA-VAEs), fixes these issues, producing meaningful reports of uncertainty in a variety of scenarios, including interpolation, image corruption, and even out-of-distribution detection. We show EA-VAEs may prove useful both as models of perception in computational neuroscience and as inference tools in computer vision.">

        <tr id="Molecular simulations have assumed a paramount role in the fields of chemistry, biology, and material sciences, being able to capture the intricate dynamic properties of systems. Within this realm, coarse-grained (CG) techniques have emerged as invaluable tools to sample large-scale systems and reach extended timescales by simplifying system representation. However, CG approaches come with a trade-off: they sacrifice atomistic details that might hold significant relevance in deciphering the investigated process. Therefore, a recommended approach is to identify key CG conformations and process them using backmapping methods, which retrieve atomistic coordinates. Currently, rule-based methods yield subpar geometries and rely on energy relaxation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. Conversely, machine learning techniques offer higher accuracy but are either limited in transferability between systems or tied to specific CG mappings. In this work, we introduce HEroBM, a dynamic and scalable method that employs deep equivariant graph neural networks and a hierarchical approach to achieve high-resolution backmapping. HEroBM handles any type of CG mapping, offering a versatile and efficient protocol for reconstructing atomistic structures with high accuracy. Focused on local principles, HEroBM spans the entire chemical space and is transferable to systems of varying sizes. We illustrate the versatility of our framework through diverse biological systems, including a complex real-case scenario. Here, our end-to-end backmapping approach accurately generates the atomistic coordinates of a G protein-coupled receptor bound to an organic small molecule within a cholesterol/phospholipid bilayer.">

While deep neural network models offer promise in approximating the conditional law of such processes, their effectiveness is hindered by the curse of dimensionality caused by the infinite dimensionality and non-smooth nature of these problems. To address this, we propose a two-step solution. Firstly, we develop a stable dimension reduction technique, projecting the law of a reasonably broad class of Volterra process onto a low-dimensional statistical manifold of non-positive sectional curvature. Next, we introduce a sequentially deep learning model tailored to the manifold's geometry, which we show can approximate the projected conditional law of the Volterra process. Our model leverages an auxiliary hypernetwork to dynamically update its internal parameters, allowing it to encode non-stationary dynamics of the Volterra process, and it can be interpreted as a gating mechanism in a mixture of expert models where each expert is specialized at a specific point in time. Our hypernetwork further allows us to achieve approximation rates that would seemingly only be possible with very large networks.">

Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a denoising-diffusion objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles, allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation.

We extend methods developed for the standard entropy-based closure to the context of regularized entropy-based closures. The main idea is to interpret structure-preserving neural network approximations of the regularized entropy closure as a two-stage approximation to the original entropy closure.

We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the Gaussian Process in which the data plays the role of the energy scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and identify potential universality classes in these models.">

The tKRnet gives an explicit density model for the solution of the Liouville equation, which alleviates the curse of dimensionality issue that limits the application of traditional grid based numerical methods. To efficiently train the tKRnet, an adaptive procedure is developed to generate collocation points for the corresponding residual loss function, where samples are generated iteratively using the approximate density function at each iteration. A temporal decomposition technique is also employed to improve the long-time integration. Theoretical analysis of our proposed method is provided, and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate its performance.">

        <tr id="In this work, we propose a novel backward differential deep learning-based algorithm for solving high-dimensional nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), where the deep neural network (DNN) models are trained not only on the inputs and labels but also the differentials of the corresponding labels. This is motivated by the fact that differential deep learning can provide an efficient approximation of the labels and their derivatives with respect to inputs. The BSDEs are reformulated as differential deep learning problems by using Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin derivatives of solution to a BSDE satisfy themselves another BSDE, resulting thus in a system of BSDEs. Such formulation requires the estimation of the solution, its gradient, and the Hessian matrix, represented by the triple of processes $\left(Y, Z, \Gamma\right).$ All the integrals within this system are discretized by using the Euler-Maruyama method. Subsequently, DNNs are employed to approximate the triple of these unknown processes. The DNN parameters are backwardly optimized at each time step by minimizing a differential learning type loss function, which is defined as a weighted sum of the dynamics of the discretized BSDE system, with the first term providing the dynamics of the process $Y$ and the other the process $Z$. An error analysis is carried out to show the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Various numerical experiments up to $50$ dimensions are provided to demonstrate the high efficiency. Both theoretically and numerically, it is demonstrated that our proposed scheme is more efficient compared to other contemporary deep learning-based methodologies, especially in the computation of the process $\Gamma$.">

However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm. In the implementation phase, to show the effectiveness of GN-SINDy, we compare its results with DeePyMoD by using a Python package that is prepared for this purpose on numerous PDE discovery">

We investigate cases where the belief state geometry is represented in the final residual stream or distributed across the residual streams of multiple layers, providing a framework to explain these observations.

        <tr id="We consider the problem of making nonparametric inference in multi-dimensional diffusion models from low-frequency data. Statistical analysis in this setting is notoriously challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood and its gradient, and computational methods have thus far largely resorted to expensive simulation-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new computational approach which is motivated by PDE theory and is built around the characterisation of the transition densities as solutions of the associated heat (Fokker-Planck) equation. Employing optimal regularity results from the theory of parabolic PDEs, we prove a novel characterisation for the gradient of the likelihood. Using these developments, for the nonlinear inverse problem of recovering the diffusivity (in divergence form models), we then show that the numerical evaluation of the likelihood and its gradient can be reduced to standard elliptic eigenvalue problems, solvable by powerful finite element methods. This enables the efficient implementation of a large class of statistical algorithms, including (i) preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and Langevin-type methods for posterior sampling, and (ii) gradient-based descent optimisation schemes to compute maximum likelihood and maximum-a-posteriori estimates. We showcase the effectiveness of these methods via extensive simulation studies in a nonparametric Bayesian model with Gaussian process priors. Interestingly, the optimisation schemes provided satisfactory numerical recovery while exhibiting rapid convergence towards stationary points despite the problem nonlinearity; thus our approach may lead to significant computational speed-ups.

By learning from high-quality data, machine-learned interatomic potentials achieve accuracy on par with ab initio and first-principles methods at a fraction of their computational cost. The success of machine-learned interatomic potentials arises from integrating inductive biases such as equivariance to group actions on an atomic system, e.g., equivariance to rotations and reflections. In particular, the field has notably advanced with the emergence of equivariant message-passing architectures. Most of these models represent an atomic system using spherical tensors, tensor products of which require complicated numerical coefficients and can be computationally demanding. This work introduces higher-rank irreducible Cartesian tensors as an alternative to spherical tensors, addressing the above limitations. We integrate irreducible Cartesian tensor products into message-passing neural networks and prove the equivariance of the resulting layers. Through empirical evaluations on various benchmark data sets, we consistently observe on-par or better performance than that of state-of-the-art spherical models.">

Training DNNs is posed as an optimization problem to learn network weights or parameters that well-approximate a mapping from input to target data. Multiway data or tensors arise naturally in myriad ways in deep learning, in particular as input data and as high-dimensional weights and features extracted by the network, with the latter often being a bottleneck in terms of speed and memory. In this work, we leverage tensor representations and processing to efficiently parameterize DNNs when learning from high-dimensional data. We propose tensor neural networks (t-NNs), a natural extension of traditional fully-connected networks, that can be trained efficiently in a reduced, yet more powerful parameter space. Our t-NNs are built upon matrix-mimetic tensor-tensor products, which retain algebraic properties of matrix multiplication while capturing high-dimensional correlations. Mimeticity enables t-NNs to inherit desirable properties of modern DNN architectures. We exemplify this by extending recent work on stable neural networks, which interpret DNNs as discretizations of differential equations, to our multidimensional framework. We provide empirical evidence of the parametric advantages of t-NNs on dimensionality reduction using autoencoders and classification using fully-connected and stable variants on benchmark imaging datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10.">

Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.">

The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in (Qu et.al, 2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.">

        <tr id="Nonsense correlations frequently develop between independent random variables that evolve with time. Therefore, it is not surprising that they appear between the components of vectors carrying out multidimensional random walks, such as those describing the trajectories of biomolecules in molecular dynamics simulations. The existence of these correlations does not imply in itself a problem. Still, it can present a problem when the trajectories are analyzed with an algorithm such as the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) because it seeks to maximize correlations without discriminating whether they have physical origin or not. In this Article, we employ random walks occurring on multidimensional harmonic potentials to evaluate the influence of fortuitous correlations in PCA. We demonstrate that, because of them, this algorithm affords misleading results when applied to a single trajectory. The errors do not only affect the directions of the first eigenvectors and their eigenvalues, but the very definition of the molecule’s “essential space” may be wrong. Additionally, the main principal component’s probability distributions present artificial structures which do not correspond with the shape of the potential energy surface. Finally, we show that the PCA of two realistic protein models, human serum albumin and lysozyme, behave similarly to the simple harmonic models. In all cases, the problems can be mitigated and eventually eliminated by doing PCA on concatenated trajectories formed from a large enough number of individual simulations.">

        <tr id="The development of interatomic potentials that can effectively capture a wide range of atomic environments is a complex challenge due to several reasons. Materials can exist in numerous structural forms (e.g., crystalline, amorphous, defects, interfaces) and phases (solid, liquid, gas, plasma). Each form may require different treatment in potential modeling to reflect the real physical behavior correctly. Atoms interact through various forces such as electrostatic, van der Waals, ionic bonding, covalent bonding, and metallic bonding, which manifest differently depending on the chemical elements and their electronic structures. Furthermore, the effective interaction among atoms can change with external conditions like temperature, pressure, and chemical environment. Consequently, creating an interatomic potential that performs well across diverse conditions is difficult since optimizing the potential for one set of conditions can lead to a trade-off in the accuracy of predicted properties associated with other conditions. In this paper, we present a method to construct accurate, efficient and transferable interatomic potentials by adapting to the local atomic environment of each atom within a system. The collection of atomic environments of interest is partitioned into several clusters of atomic environments. Each cluster represents a distinctive local environment and is used to define a corresponding local potential. We introduce a many-body many-potential expansion to smoothly blend these local potentials to ensure global continuity of the potential energy surface. This is achieved by computing the probability functions that determine the likelihood of an atom belonging to each cluster. We apply the environment-adaptive machine learning potentials to predict observable properties for Ta element and InP compound, and compare them with density functional theory calculations.">

Orthogonal constraints (Stiefel manifold) is a commonly met constraint in these applications, and the sparsity is usually enforced through the element-wise L1 norm. Many applications can be found on optimization over Stiefel manifold within the area of physics and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel idea by tackling the Stiefel manifold through an nonlinear eigen-approach by first using ADMM to split the problem into smooth optimization over manifold and convex non-smooth optimization, and then transforming the former into the form of nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency (NEPv) which is solved by self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, and the latter can be found to have an closed-form solution through proximal gradient. Compared with existing methods, our proposed algorithm takes the advantage of specific structure of the objective function, and has efficient convergence results under mild assumptions.">

        <tr id="The algorithm ``automated compression of environments'' (ACE) [Nat. Phys. 18, 662 (2022)] provides a versatile way of simulating an extremely broad class of open quantum systems. This is achieved by encapsulating the influence of the environment, which is determined by the interaction Hamiltonian(s) and initial states, into compact process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) representations. The generality of the ACE method comes at high numerical cost. Here, we demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvement of ACE is possible by changing the order of PT-MPO contraction from a sequential to a tree-like scheme. The problem of combining two partial PT-MPOs with large inner bonds is solved by a preselection approach. The drawbacks of the preselection approach are that the MPO compression is suboptimal and that it is more prone to error accumulation than sequential combination and compression. We therefore also identify strategies to mitigate these disadvantages by fine-tuning compression parameters. This results in a scheme that is similar in compression efficiency and accuracy to the original ACE algorithm, yet is significantly faster. Our numerical experiments reach similar conclusions for bosonic and fermionic test cases, suggesting that our findings are characteristic of the combination of PT-MPOs more generally.">

        <tr id="In this paper, the evolution equation that defines the online critic for the approximation of the optimal value function is cast in a general class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Exploiting some core tools of RKHS theory, this formulation allows deriving explicit bounds on the performance of the critic in terms of the kernel and definition of the RKHS, the number of basis functions, and the location of centers used to define scattered bases. The performance of the critic is precisely measured in terms of the power function of the scattered basis used in approximations, and it can be used either in an a priori evaluation of potential bases or in an a posteriori assessments of value function error for basis enrichment or pruning. The most concise bounds in the paper describe explicitly how the critic performance depends on the placement of centers, as measured by their fill distance in a subset that contains the trajectory of the critic.">

        <tr id="Accurately sampling of protein conformations is pivotal for advances in biology and medicine. Although there have been tremendous progress in protein structure prediction in recent years due to deep learning, models that can predict the different stable conformations of proteins with high accuracy and structural validity are still lacking. Here, we introduce Diffold, a cutting-edge approach designed for robust sampling of diverse protein conformations based solely on amino acid sequences. This method transforms AlphaFold2 into a diffusion model by implementing a conformation-based diffusion process and adapting the architecture to process diffused inputs effectively. To counteract the inherent conformational bias in the Protein Data Bank, we developed a novel hierarchical reweighting protocol based on structural clustering. Our evaluations demonstrate that Diffold outperforms existing methods in terms of successful sampling and structural validity. The comparisons with long time molecular dynamics show that Diffold can overcome the energy barrier existing in molecular dynamics simulations and perform more efficient sampling. Furthermore, We showcase Diffold’s utility in drug discovery through its application in neural protein-ligand docking. In a blind test, it accurately predicted a novel protein-ligand complex, underscoring its potential to impact real-world biological research. Additionally, we present other modes of sampling using Diffold, including partial sampling with fixed motif, langevin dynamics and structural interpolation.">

        <tr id="Conventional diffusion models typically relies on a fixed forward process, which implicitly defines complex marginal distributions over latent variables. This can often complicate the reverse process' task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the standard Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM's strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM's capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories, and demonstrate how the framework may be adopted for learning bridges between two distributions. The results underscores NFDM's versatility and its potential for a wide range of applications.">

        <tr id="We present an approach called guaranteed block autoencoder that leverages Tensor Correlations (GBATC) for reducing the spatiotemporal data generated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and other scientific applications. It uses a multidimensional block of tensors (spanning in space and time) for both input and output, capturing the spatiotemporal and interspecies relationship within a tensor. The tensor consists of species that represent different elements in a CFD simulation. To guarantee the error bound of the reconstructed data, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the residual between the original and reconstructed data. This yields a basis matrix, which is then used to project the residual of each instance. The resulting coefficients are retained to enable accurate reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can deliver two orders of magnitude in reduction while still keeping the errors of primary data under scientifically acceptable bounds. Compared to reduction-based approaches based on SZ, our method achieves a substantially higher compression ratio for a given error bound or a better error for a given compression ratio.">

We assume that a good proposal kernel to move only a subset of the degrees of freedoms (also known as collective variables) is known a priori. This proposal kernel can for example be built using normalizing flows. We show how to extend the move from the collective variable space to the full space and how to implement an accept-reject step in order to get a reversible chain with respect to a target probability measure. The accept-reject step does not require to know the marginal of the original measure in the collective variable (namely to know the free energy). The obtained algorithm admits several variants, some of them being very close to methods which have been proposed previously in the literature. We show how the obtained acceptance ratio can be expressed in terms of the work which appears in the Jarzynski-Crooks equality, at least for some variants. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the efficiency of the approach on various simple test cases, and allow us to compare the variants of the algorithm.">

In principle, both space and time of the processes can be discrete or continuous. In this work, we study time-continuous Markov jump processes on discrete state spaces and investigate their correspondence to state-continuous diffusion processes given by SDEs. In particular, we revisit the $\textit{Ehrenfest process}$, which converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the infinite state space limit. Likewise, we can show that the time-reversal of the Ehrenfest process converges to the time-reversed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This observation bridges discrete and continuous state spaces and allows to carry over methods from one to the respective other setting. Additionally, we suggest an algorithm for training the time-reversal of Markov jump processes which relies on conditional expectations and can thus be directly related to denoising score matching. We demonstrate our methods in multiple convincing numerical experiments.">

Namely, the NN first learns the low-frequency features before learning the high-frequency ones. In this study, we rigorously develop a partial differential equation (PDE) that unravels the frequency dynamics of the error for a 2-layer NN in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime. Furthermore, using this insight, we explicitly demonstrate how an appropriate choice of distributions for the initialization weights can eliminate or control the frequency bias. We focus our study on the Fourier Features model, an NN where the first layer has sine and cosine activation functions, with frequencies sampled from a prescribed distribution. In this setup, we experimentally validate our theoretical results and compare the NN dynamics to the solution of the PDE using the finite element method. Finally, we empirically show that the same principle extends to multi-layer NNs.">

We present an accurate and data-efficient protocol based on fine-tuning of the foundational MACE-MP-0 model and showcase its capabilities on sublimation enthalpies and physical properties of ice polymorphs. Our approach requires only a few tens of training structures to achieve sub-kJ/mol accuracy in the sublimation enthalpies and sub 1 % error in densities for polymorphs at finite temperature and pressure. Exploiting this data efficiency, we explore simulations of hexagonal ice at the random phase approximation level of theory at experimental temperatures and pressures, calculating its physical properties, like pair correlation function and density, with good agreement with experiments. Our approach provides a way forward for predicting the stability of molecular crystals at finite thermodynamic conditions with the accuracy of correlated electronic structure theory.">

In this work, we propose a method called Fourier-based Identification of Novel Clusters (FINC) to identify modes produced by a generative model with a higher frequency in comparison to a reference distribution. FINC provides a scalable stochastic algorithm based on random Fourier features to estimate the eigenspace of kernel covariance matrices of two generative models and utilize the principal eigendirections to detect the sample types present more dominantly in each model. We demonstrate the application of the FINC method to standard computer vision datasets and generative model frameworks.

        <tr id="Adjoint methods have been the pillar of gradient-based optimization for decades. They enable the accurate computation of a gradient (sensitivity) of a quantity of interest with respect to all system's parameters in one calculation. When the gradient is embedded in an optimization routine, the quantity of interest can be optimized for the system to have the desired behaviour. Adjoint methods require the system's Jacobian, whose computation can be cumbersome, and is problem dependent. We propose a computational strategy to infer the adjoint sensitivities from data (observables), which bypasses the need of the Jacobian of the physical system. The key component of this strategy is an echo state network, which learns the dynamics of nonlinear regimes with varying parameters, and evolves dynamically via a hidden state. Although the framework is general, we focus on thermoacoustics governed by nonlinear and time-delayed systems. First, we show that a parameter-aware Echo State Network (ESN) infers the parameterized dynamics. Second, we derive the adjoint of the ESN to compute the sensitivity of time-averaged cost functionals. Third, we propose the Thermoacoustic Echo State Network (T-ESN), which hard constrains the physical knowledge in the network architecture. Fourth, we apply the framework to a variety of nonlinear thermoacoustic regimes of a prototypical system. We show that the T-ESN accurately infers the correct adjoint sensitivities of the time-averaged acoustic energy with respect to the flame parameters. The results are robust to noisy data, from periodic, through quasiperiodic, to chaotic regimes. A single network predicts the nonlinear bifurcations on unseen scenarios, and so the inferred adjoint sensitivities are employed to suppress an instability via steepest descent. This work opens new possibilities for gradient-based data-driven design optimization.">

We present mace, a Machine learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation, as a proof-of-concept work on emulating chemistry in a dynamical environment. Using the context of AGB outflows, we have developed an architecture that combines the use of an autoencoder (to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical network) and a set of latent ordinary differential equations (that are solved to perform the temporal evolution of the reduced features). Training this architecture with an integrated scheme makes it possible to successfully reproduce a full chemical pathway in a dynamical environment. mace outperforms its classical analogue on average by a factor 26. Furthermore, its efficient implementation in PyTorch results in a sub-linear scaling with respect to the number of hydrodynamical simulation particles.">

Despite their success, traditional VAEs rely on continuous latent variables, which deviates sharply from the discrete nature of biological neurons. Here, we developed the Poisson VAE (P-VAE), a novel architecture that combines principles of predictive coding with a VAE that encodes inputs into discrete spike counts. Combining Poisson-distributed latent variables with predictive coding introduces a metabolic cost term in the model loss function, suggesting a relationship with sparse coding which we verify empirically. Additionally, we analyze the geometry of learned representations, contrasting the P-VAE to alternative VAE models. We find that the P-VAEencodes its inputs in relatively higher dimensions, facilitating linear separability of categories in a downstream classification task with a much better (5x) sample efficiency. Our work provides an interpretable computational framework to study brain-like sensory processing and paves the way for a deeper understanding of perception as an inferential process.">

        <tr id="We develop time-series machine learning (ML) methods for closure modeling of the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) equations applied to stably stratified turbulence (SST). SST is strongly affected by fine balances between forces and becomes more anisotropic in time for decaying cases. Moreover, there is a limited understanding of the physical phenomena described by some of the terms in the URANS equations. Rather than attempting to model each term separately, it is attractive to explore the capability of machine learning to model groups of terms, i.e., to directly model the force balances. We consider decaying SST which are homogeneous and stably stratified by a uniform density gradient, enabling dimensionality reduction. We consider two time-series ML models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE). Both models perform accurately and are numerically stable in a posteriori tests. Furthermore, we explore the data requirements of the ML models by extracting physically relevant timescales of the complex system. We find that the ratio of the timescales of the minimum information required by the ML models to accurately capture the dynamics of the SST corresponds to the Reynolds number of the flow. The current framework provides the backbone to explore the capability of such models to capture the dynamics of higher-dimensional complex SST flows.">

In this sense, there is a need to find new ways to obtain data in a more economical manner. Thus, in this work we study the application of time series forecasting to fluid dynamics problems, where the aim is to predict the flow dynamics using only past information. We focus our study on models based on deep learning that do not require a high amount of data for training, as this is the problem we are trying to address. Specifically in this work we have tested three autoregressive models where two of them are fully based on deep learning and the other one is a hybrid model that combines modal decomposition with deep learning. We ask these models to generate $200$ time-ahead predictions of two datasets coming from a numerical simulation and experimental measurements, where the latter is characterized by being turbulent. We show how the hybrid model generates more reliable predictions in the experimental case, as it is physics-informed in the sense that the modal decomposition extracts the physics in a way that allows us to predict it.">

        <tr id="Formulating dynamical models for physical phenomena is essential for understanding the interplay between the different mechanisms and predicting the evolution of physical states. However, a dynamical model alone is often insufficient to address these fundamental tasks, as it suffers from model errors and uncertainties. One common remedy is to rely on data assimilation, where the state estimate is updated with observations of the true system. Ensemble filters sequentially assimilate observations by updating a set of samples over time. They operate in two steps: a forecast step that propagates each sample through the dynamical model and an analysis step that updates the samples with incoming observations. For accurate and robust predictions of dynamical systems, discrete solutions must preserve their critical invariants. While modern numerical solvers satisfy these invariants, existing invariant-preserving analysis steps are limited to Gaussian settings and are often not compatible with classical regularization techniques of ensemble filters, e.g., inflation and covariance tapering. The present work focuses on preserving linear invariants, such as mass, stoichiometric balance of chemical species, and electrical charges. Using tools from measure transport theory (Spantini et al., 2022, SIAM Review), we introduce a generic class of nonlinear ensemble filters that automatically preserve desired linear invariants in non-Gaussian filtering problems. By specializing this framework to the Gaussian setting, we recover a constrained formulation of the Kalman filter. Then, we show how to combine existing regularization techniques for the ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994, J. Geophys. Res.) with the preservation of the linear invariants. Finally, we assess the benefits of preserving linear invariants for the ensemble Kalman filter and nonlinear ensemble filters.">

However, all current generative approaches are limited to unfolding a fixed set of observables, making them unable to perform full-event unfolding in the variable dimensional environment of collider data. A novel modification to the variational latent diffusion model (VLD) approach to generative unfolding is presented, which allows for unfolding of high- and variable-dimensional feature spaces.

        <tr id="Motivated by the growing theoretical understanding of neural networks that employ the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) as their activation function, we revisit the use of ReLU activation functions for learning implicit neural representations (INRs). Inspired by second order B-spline wavelets, we incorporate a set of simple constraints to the ReLU neurons in each layer of a deep neural network (DNN) to remedy the spectral bias. This in turn enables its use for various INR tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, one can learn state-of-the-art INRs based on a DNN composed of only ReLU neurons. Next, by leveraging recent theoretical works which characterize the kinds of functions ReLU neural networks learn, we provide a way to quantify the regularity of the learned function. This offers a principled approach to selecting the hyperparameters in INR architectures. We substantiate our claims through experiments in signal representation, super resolution, and computed tomography, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of our method.

Using a (2+1)-dimensional real scalar model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our PFMCMC method in modeling highly hierarchical order parameter probability distributions and simulating critical bubble configurations.

        <tr id="We develop a Mean-Field (MF) view of the learning dynamics of overparametrized Artificial Neural Networks (NN) under data symmetric in law wrt the action of a general compact group $G$. We consider for this a class of generalized shallow NNs given by an ensemble of $N$ multi-layer units, jointly trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and possibly symmetry-leveraging (SL) techniques, such as Data Augmentation (DA), Feature Averaging (FA) or Equivariant Architectures (EA). We introduce the notions of weakly and strongly invariant laws (WI and SI) on the parameter space of each single unit, corresponding, respectively, to $G$-invariant distributions, and to distributions supported on parameters fixed by the group action (which encode EA). This allows us to define symmetric models compatible with taking $N\to\infty$ and give an interpretation of the asymptotic dynamics of DA, FA and EA in terms of Wasserstein Gradient Flows describing their MF limits. When activations respect the group action, we show that, for symmetric data, DA, FA and freely-trained models obey the exact same MF dynamic, which stays in the space of WI laws and minimizes therein the population risk. We also give a counterexample to the general attainability of an optimum over SI laws. Despite this, quite remarkably, we show that the set of SI laws is also preserved by the MF dynamics even when freely trained. This sharply contrasts the finite-$N$ setting, in which EAs are generally not preserved by unconstrained SGD. We illustrate the validity of our findings as $N$ gets larger in a teacher-student experimental setting, training a student NN to learn from a WI, SI or arbitrary teacher model through various SL schemes. We last deduce a data-driven heuristic to discover the largest subspace of parameters supporting SI distributions for a problem, that could be used for designing EA with minimal generalization error.">

It outperforms existing methods on challenging spatiotemporal datasets by offering substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a useful tool for modeling and understanding complex dynamical systems observed under realistic, unconstrained conditions.">

        <tr id="In this study, we introduce a unified neural network architecture, the Deep Equilibrium Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian (DEQH) model, which incorporates Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) for predicting Density Functional Theory (DFT) Hamiltonians. The DEQH model inherently captures the self-consistency nature of Hamiltonian, a critical aspect often overlooked by traditional machine learning approaches for Hamiltonian prediction. By employing DEQ within our model architecture, we circumvent the need for DFT calculations during the training phase to introduce the Hamiltonian's self-consistency, thus addressing computational bottlenecks associated with large or complex systems. We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian. Ablation studies of DEQHNet further elucidate the network's effectiveness, offering insights into the potential of DEQ-integrated networks for Hamiltonian learning.">

In this research, we introduce a novel neural decoder model built upon GP models. The core idea is that two GPs generate neural data and their associated labels using a set of low-dimensional latent variables. Under this modeling assumption, the latent variables represent the underlying manifold or essential features present in the neural data. When GPs are trained, the latent variable can be inferred from neural data to decode the labels with a high accuracy. We demonstrate an application of this decoder model in a verbal memory experiment dataset and show that the decoder accuracy in predicting stimulus significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art decoder models. The preceding performance of this model highlights the importance of utilizing non-parametric models in the analysis of neuroscience data.">

Our approach preserves probability exactly and allows us to evaluate expectation values of analytical observables to in principle arbitrary accuracy; to showcase this, we derive perturbation expansions for the moments of the spatial increment, the finite-time Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and the mean medium entropy production rate. For an explicit multiplicative-noise system with available analytical solution, we validate all our perturbative results. Throughout, we compare our perturbative results to those obtained from the widely used Gaussian approximation of the short-time propagator; we demonstrate that this Gaussian propagator leads to errors that can be many orders of magnitude larger than those resulting from our perturbation approach. Potential applications of our results include parametrizing diffusive stochastic dynamics from observed time series, and sampling path spaces of stochastic trajectories numerically.">

        <tr id="Entropy production (EP) is a central quantity in nonequilibrium physics as it monitors energy dissipation, reversibility, and free energy differences during thermodynamic transformations. Estimating EP, however, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally due to limited access to the system dynamics. For overdamped Langevin dynamics and Markov jump processes it was recently proposed that, from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TUR), short-time cumulant currents can be used to estimate EP without knowledge of the dynamics. Yet, estimation of EP in underdamped Langevin systems remains an active challenge. To address this, we derive a modified TUR that relates the statistics of two specific novel currents -- one cumulant current and one stochastic current -- to a system's EP. These two distinct but related currents are used to constrain EP in the modified TUR. One highlight is that there always exists a family of currents such that the uncertainty relations saturate, even for long-time averages and in nonsteady-state scenarios. Another is that our method only requires limited knowledge of the dynamics -- specifically, the damping-coefficient to mass ratio and the diffusion constant. This uncertainty relation allows estimating EP for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We validate the method numerically, through applications to several underdamped systems, to underscore the flexibility in obtaining EP in nonequilibrium Langevin systems.">

The training of LFIS utilizes a unique method that enforces the structure of a derived partial differential equation to neural networks modeling velocity fields. By considering the neural velocity field as an importance sampler, sample weights can be computed through accumulating errors along the sample trajectories driven by neural velocity fields, ensuring unbiased and consistent estimation of statistical quantities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFIS through its application to a range of benchmark problems, on many of which LFIS achieved state-of-the-art performance.">

Rather, it implements a composition -- of linear projection, nonlinear scaling, and then affine transformation -- on input activation vectors. We develop both a new mathematical expression and geometric intuition, to make the net effect more transparent. We emphasize that, when LayerNorm acts on an N-dimensional vector space, all outcomes of LayerNorm lie within the intersection of an (N-1)-dimensional hyperplane and the interior of an N-dimensional hyperellipsoid. This intersection is the interior of an (N-1)-dimensional hyperellipsoid, and typical inputs are mapped near its surface. We find the direction and length of the principal axes of this (N-1)-dimensional hyperellipsoid via the eigen-decomposition of a simply constructed matrix.">

        <tr id="We combine power functional theory and machine learning to study non-equilibrium overdamped many-body systems of colloidal particles at the level of one-body fields. We first sample in steady state the one-body fields relevant for the dynamics from computer simulations of Brownian particles under the influence of randomly generated external fields. A neural network is then trained with this data to represent locally in space the formally exact functional mapping from the one-body density and velocity profiles to the one-body internal force field. The trained network is used to analyse the non-equilibrium superadiabatic force field and the transport coefficients such as shear and bulk viscosities. Due to the local learning approach, the network can be applied to systems much larger than the original simulation box in which the one-body fields are sampled. Complemented with the exact non-equilibrium one-body force balance equation and a continuity equation, the network yields viable predictions of the dynamics in time-dependent situations. Even though training is based on steady states only, the predicted dynamics is in good agreement with simulation results. A neural dynamical density functional theory can be straightforwardly implemented as a limiting case in which the internal force field is that of an equilibrium system. The framework is general and directly applicable to other many-body systems of interacting particles following Brownian dynamics.">

        <tr id="In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces, but in a learning equilibrium, the problem can be linearized and reduced to many weakly coupled one-dimensional problems. We use the duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distributions of fluctuations of the trainable variables. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.">

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for approximating the distribution of complex data. It is known that data passing through a trained DNN classifier undergoes a series of geometric and topological simplifications. While some progress has been made toward understanding these transformations in neural networks with smooth activation functions, an understanding in the more general setting of non-smooth activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which tend to perform better, is required. Here we propose that the geometric transformations performed by DNNs during classification tasks have parallels to those expected under Hamilton's Ricci flow - a tool from differential geometry that evolves a manifold by smoothing its curvature, in order to identify its topology. To illustrate this idea, we present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a DNN, and use this framework to motivate a notion of `global Ricci network flow' that can be used to assess a DNN's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems. By training more than $1,500$ DNN classifiers of different widths and depths on synthetic and real-world data, we show that the strength of global Ricci network flow-like behaviour correlates with accuracy for well-trained DNNs, independently of depth, width and data set. Our findings motivate the use of tools from differential and discrete geometry to the problem of explainability in deep learning.">

We develop a dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently solves the likelihood, decoding, and parameter learning problems for tree-based HMMs with coupled branches. Our approach scales polynomially with the number of states and nodes, making it computationally feasible for a wide range of applications and does not suffer from the underflow problem.

        <tr id="Numerous applications in biology, statistics, science, and engineering require generating samples from high-dimensional probability distributions. In recent years, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method has emerged as a state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, exploiting the shape of such high-dimensional target distributions to efficiently generate samples. Despite its impressive empirical success and increasing popularity, its wide-scale adoption remains limited due to the high computational cost of gradient calculation. Moreover, applying this method is impossible when the gradient of the posterior cannot be computed (for example, with black-box simulators). To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with a surrogate model. In this multi-fidelity algorithm, the acceptance probability is computed in the first stage via a standard HMC proposal using an inexpensive differentiable surrogate model, and if the proposal is accepted, the posterior is evaluated in the second stage using the high-fidelity (HF) numerical solver. Splitting the standard HMC algorithm into these two stages allows for approximating the gradient of the posterior efficiently, while producing accurate posterior samples by using HF numerical solvers in the second stage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm for a range of problems, including linear and nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems with in-silico data and experimental data. The proposed algorithm is shown to seamlessly integrate with various low-fidelity and HF models, priors, and datasets. Remarkably, our proposed method outperforms the traditional HMC algorithm in both computational and statistical efficiency by several orders of magnitude, all while retaining or improving the accuracy in computed posterior statistics.">

        <tr id="Machine learning (ML) offers promising new approaches to tackle complex problems and has been increasingly adopted in chemical and materials sciences. Broadly speaking, ML models employ generic mathematical functions and attempt to learn essential physics and chemistry from a large amount of data. Consequently, because of the lack of physical or chemical principles in the functional form, the reliability of the predictions is oftentimes not guaranteed, particularly for data far out of distribution. It is critical to quantify the uncertainty in model predictions and understand how the uncertainty propagates to downstream chemical and materials applications. Herein, we review and categorize existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for atomistic ML under a united framework of probabilistic modeling with the aim of elucidating the similarities and differences between them. We also discuss performance metrics to evaluate the calibration, precision, accuracy, and efficiency of the UQ methods and techniques for model recalibration. In addition, we discuss uncertainty propagation (UP) in widely used simulation techniques in chemical and materials science, such as molecular dynamics and microkinetic modeling. We also provide remarks on the challenges and future opportunities of UQ and UP in atomistic ML.">

        <tr id="Understanding how neural systems efficiently process information through distributed representations is a fundamental challenge at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning. Recent approaches analyze the statistical and geometrical attributes of neural representations as population-level mechanistic descriptors of task implementation. In particular, manifold capacity has emerged as a promising framework linking population geometry to the separability of neural manifolds. However, this metric has been limited to linear readouts. Here, we propose a theoretical framework that overcomes this limitation by leveraging contextual input information. We derive an exact formula for the context-dependent capacity that depends on manifold geometry and context correlations, and validate it on synthetic and real data. Our framework's increased expressivity captures representation untanglement in deep networks at early stages of the layer hierarchy, previously inaccessible to analysis. As context-dependent nonlinearity is ubiquitous in neural systems, our data-driven and theoretically grounded approach promises to elucidate context-dependent computation across scales, datasets, and models.">

        <tr id="The generative modeling of data on manifold is an important task, for which diffusion models in flat spaces typically need nontrivial adaptations. This article demonstrates how a technique called `trivialization' can transfer the effectiveness of diffusion models in Euclidean spaces to Lie groups. In particular, an auxiliary momentum variable was algorithmically introduced to help transport the position variable between data distribution and a fixed, easy-to-sample distribution. Normally, this would incur further difficulty for manifold data because momentum lives in a space that changes with the position. However, our trivialization technique creates to a new momentum variable that stays in a simple $\textbf{fixed vector space}$. This design, together with a manifold preserving integrator, simplifies implementation and avoids inaccuracies created by approximations such as projections to tangent space and manifold, which were typically used in prior work, hence facilitating generation with high-fidelity and efficiency. The resulting method achieves state-of-the-art performance on protein and RNA torsion angle generation and sophisticated torus datasets. We also, arguably for the first time, tackle the generation of data on high-dimensional Special Orthogonal and Unitary groups, the latter essential for quantum problems.">

However, exploring the conformational space, especially for large systems with slow transitions, often requires enhanced sampling methods. Although conducting MD at high temperatures provides a straightforward approach, resulting conformational ensembles diverge significantly from those at low temperatures. To address this discrepancy, we propose a novel probability density-based reweighting (PDR) method. PDR exhibits robust performance across four distinct systems, including a miniprotein, a cyclic peptide, a protein loop, and a protein-peptide complex. It accurately restores the conformational distributions at high temperatures to those at low temperatures.

This theory provides universal, exact relations for quantities like work, which have been verified in experiments where a fully resolved description allows direct access to such quantities. Complementary studies consider partially hidden, coarse-grained descriptions, in which the mean entropy production typically is not directly accessible but can be bounded in terms of observable quantities. Going beyond the mean, we introduce a fluctuating entropy production that applies to individual trajectories in a coarse-grained description under time-dependent driving. Thus, this concept is applicable to the broad and experimentally significant class of driven systems in which not all relevant states can be resolved. We provide a paradigmatic example by studying an experimentally verified protein unfolding process. As a consequence, the entire distribution of the coarse-grained entropy production rather than merely its mean retains spatial and temporal information about the microscopic process. In particular, we obtain a bound on the distribution of the physical entropy production of individual unfolding events.">

The continuous-mixture autoregressive networks (CANs) enable the construction of accurate effective actions with tractable probability density estimation. Our numerical results demonstrate that this methodology not only facilitates the construction of effective actions at specified temperatures but also adeptly estimates the action at intermediate temperatures using data from both lower and higher temperature ensembles.

        <tr id="Identifying latent interactions within complex systems is key to unlocking deeper insights into their operational dynamics, including how their elements affect each other and contribute to the overall system behavior. For instance, in neuroscience, discovering neuron-to-neuron interactions is essential for understanding brain function; in ecology, recognizing the interactions among populations is key for understanding complex ecosystems. Such systems, often modeled as dynamical systems, typically exhibit noisy high-dimensional and non-stationary temporal behavior that renders their identification challenging. Existing dynamical system identification methods often yield operators that accurately capture short-term behavior but fail to predict long-term trends, suggesting an incomplete capture of the underlying process. Methods that consider extended forecasts (e.g., recurrent neural networks) lack explicit representations of element-wise interactions and require substantial training data, thereby failing to capture interpretable network operators. Here we introduce Lookahead-driven Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability (LINOCS), a robust learning procedure for identifying hidden dynamical interactions in noisy time-series data. LINOCS integrates several multi-step predictions with adaptive weights during training to recover dynamical operators that can yield accurate long-term predictions. We demonstrate LINOCS' ability to recover the ground truth dynamical operators underlying synthetic time-series data for multiple dynamical systems models (including linear, piece-wise linear, time-changing linear systems' decomposition, and regularized linear time-varying systems) as well as its capability to produce meaningful operators with robust reconstructions through various real-world examples.">

We propose a novel approach called Diffusion Bridge Network (DBN) to address this challenge. Based on the theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge, this method directly learns to simulate an Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that connects the output distribution of a single ensemble member to the output distribution of the ensembled model, allowing us to obtain ensemble prediction without having to invoke forward pass through all the ensemble models. By substituting the heavy ensembles with this lightweight neural network constructing DBN, we achieved inference with reduced computational cost while maintaining accuracy and uncertainty scores on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet.

        <tr id="There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.">

This method's integration of parametric space information significantly reduces the need for training data to effectively predict high-fidelity solutions from low-fidelity ones. In this study, we examine a two-dimensional steady-state heat transfer analysis within a highly heterogeneous materials microstructure. The heat conductivity coefficients for two different materials are condensed from a 101 x 101 grid to smaller grids. We then solve the boundary value problem on the coarsest grid using a pre-trained physics-informed neural operator network known as Finite Operator Learning (FOL). The resulting low-fidelity solution is subsequently upscaled back to a 101 x 101 grid using a newly designed enhanced autoencoder. The novelty of the developed enhanced autoencoder lies in the concatenation of heat conductivity maps of different resolutions to the decoder segment in distinct steps. Hence the developed algorithm is named microstructure-embedded autoencoder (MEA). We compare the MEA outcomes with those from finite element methods, the standard U-Net, and various other upscaling techniques, including interpolation functions and feedforward neural networks (FFNN). Our analysis shows that MEA outperforms these methods in terms of computational efficiency and error on test cases. As a result, the MEA serves as a potential supplement to neural operator networks, effectively upscaling low-fidelity solutions to high fidelity while preserving critical details often lost in traditional upscaling methods, particularly at sharp interfaces like those seen with interpolation.">

Meanwhile, Maximum Manifold Capacity Representation (MMCR) presents a new frontier for SSL by optimizing class separability via manifold compression. However, MMCR demands extensive input views, resulting in significant computational costs and protracted pre-training durations.

However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using online SGD grows as $d^{p-1}$, which is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently. Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples required by a single neuron to weakly-recover these directions using online SGD from a random start in high dimensions. Our analytical results are confirmed in simulations of two-layer neural networks and unveil a new mechanism for hierarchical learning in neural networks.">

The main challenge is to model a rich variety of time series, leverage any available external signals and provide sharp predictions with statistical guarantees. In this work, we propose a new forecasting model that combines discrete state space hidden Markov models with recent neural network architectures and training procedures inspired by vector quantized variational autoencoders. We introduce a variational discrete posterior distribution of the latent states given the observations and a two-stage training procedure to alternatively train the parameters of the latent states and of the emission distributions. By learning a collection of emission laws and temporarily activating them depending on the hidden process dynamics, the proposed method allows to explore large datasets and leverage available external signals. We assess the performance of the proposed method using several datasets and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions.">

However, it still faces significant challenges, e.g., extrapolating to uncharted chemical spaces, interpreting long-range electrostatics, and mapping complex macroscopic properties. To address these issues, we advocate for a synergistic integration of physical principles and machine learning techniques within the framework of a physically informed neural network (PINN). This innovative approach involves the incorporation of physical constraints directly into the parameters of the neural network, coupled with the implementation of a global optimization strategy. We choose the AMOEBA+ force field as the physics-based model for embedding, and then train and test it using the diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) dataset as a case study. The results reveal a significant breakthrough in constructing a precise and noise-robust machine learning force field. Utilizing two training sets with hundreds of samples, our model exhibits remarkable generalization and DFT accuracy in describing molecular interactions and enables a precise prediction of the macroscopic properties such as diffusion coefficient with minimal cost.

In this work, we propose that a ML model, trained to predict the state one-step-ahead from several latest historic states, can accurately replicate the bifurcation diagram and the Lyapunov exponents of discrete dynamic systems. The characteristics for different values of the hyper-parameters are captured universally by a single ML model, while the previous works considered training the ML model independently by fixing the hyper-parameters to be specific values. Our benchmarks on the one- and two-dimensional Logistic maps show that variational quantum circuit can reproduce the long-term characteristics with higher accuracy than the long short-term memory (a well-recognized classical ML model). Our work reveals an essential difference between the ML for the chaotic characteristics and that for standard tasks, from the perspective of the relation between performance and model complexity. Our results suggest that quantum circuit model exhibits potential advantages on mitigating over-fitting, achieving higher accuracy and stability.">

Existing research has identified a clear divide in methodologies for learning mixtures of discrete and continuous-time Markov chains, while the latter presents additional complexities for recovery accuracy and efficiency. We introduce a unifying strategy for learning mixtures of discrete and continuous-time Markov chains, focusing on hitting times, which are well defined for both types. Specifically, we design a reconstruction algorithm that outputs a mixture which accurately reflects the estimated hitting times and demonstrates resilience to noise. We introduce an efficient gradient-descent approach, specifically tailored to manage the computational complexity and non-symmetric characteristics inherent in the calculation of hitting time derivatives. Our approach is also of significant interest when applied to a single Markov chain, thus extending the methodologies previously established by Hoskins et al. and Wittmann et al.

        <tr id="Machine learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool for generating new molecular and material structures. The success of state-of-the-art models stems from their ability to incorporate physical symmetries, such as translation, rotation, and periodicity. Here, we present a novel generative method called Response Matching (RM), which leverages the fact that each stable material or molecule exists at the minimum of its potential energy surface. Consequently, any perturbation induces a response in energy and stress, driving the structure back to equilibrium. Matching to such response is closely related to score matching in diffusion models. By employing the combination of a machine learning interatomic potential and random structure search as the denoising model, RM exploits the locality of atomic interactions, and inherently respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. RM is the first model to handle both molecules and bulk materials under the same framework. We demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of RM across three systems: a small organic molecular dataset, stable crystals from the Materials Project, and one-shot learning on a single diamond configuration.">

In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality generative modelling method based on high-order Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score matching. This motive is proved by third-order Langevin dynamics. By augmenting the previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position, velocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data generation at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude. Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.">

Most existed works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large.

In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.">

We present a pipelined compression approach that first uses neural-network-based techniques to derive regions where QoI are highly likely to be present. Then, we employ a Guaranteed Autoencoder (GAE) to compress data with differential error bounds. GAE uses QoI information to apply low-error compression to only these regions. This results in overall high compression ratios while still achieving downstream goals of simulation or data collections. Experimental results are presented for climate data generated from the E3SM Simulation model for downstream quantities such as tropical cyclone and atmospheric river detection and tracking.

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamics of generic 3D scenes is fundamentally challenging in computer vision, essential in enhancing applications related to scene reconstruction, motion tracking, and avatar creation. In this work, we address the task as the problem of inferring dense, long-range motion of 3D points. By observing a set of point trajectories, we aim to learn an implicit motion field parameterized by a neural network to predict the movement of novel points within the same domain, without relying on any data-driven or scene-specific priors. To achieve this, our approach builds upon the recently introduced dynamic point field model that learns smooth deformation fields between the canonical frame and individual observation frames. However, temporal consistency between consecutive frames is neglected, and the number of required parameters increases linearly with the sequence length due to per-frame modeling. To address these shortcomings, we exploit the intrinsic regularization provided by SIREN, and modify the input layer to produce a spatiotemporally smooth motion field. Additionally, we analyze the motion field Jacobian matrix, and discover that the motion degrees of freedom (DOFs) in an infinitesimal area around a point and the network hidden variables have different behaviors to affect the model's representational power. This enables us to improve the model representation capability while retaining the model compactness. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of overfitting, we introduce a regularization term based on the assumption of piece-wise motion smoothness. Our experiments assess the model's performance in predicting unseen point trajectories and its application in temporal mesh alignment with guidance. The results demonstrate its superiority and effectiveness. The code and data for the project are publicly available: \url{https://yz-cnsdqz.github.io/eigenmotion/DOMA/}">

While the convergence behavior of Langevin Dynamics under unimodal distributions has been extensively studied in the literature, in practice the data distribution could consist of multiple distinct modes. In this work, we investigate Langevin Dynamics in producing samples from multimodal distributions and theoretically study its mode-seeking properties. We prove that under a variety of sub-Gaussian mixtures, Langevin Dynamics is unlikely to find all mixture components within a sub-exponential number of steps in the data dimension. To reduce the mode-seeking tendencies of Langevin Dynamics, we propose Chained Langevin Dynamics, which divides the data vector into patches of constant size and generates every patch sequentially conditioned on the previous patches. We perform a theoretical analysis of Chained Langevin Dynamics by reducing it to sampling from a constant-dimensional distribution. We present the results of several numerical experiments on synthetic and real image datasets, supporting our theoretical results on the iteration complexities of sample generation from mixture distributions using the chained and vanilla Langevin Dynamics.

While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Understanding what makes high-dimensional data learnable is a fundamental question in machine learning. On the one hand, it is believed that the success of deep learning lies in its ability to build a hierarchy of representations that become increasingly more abstract with depth, going from simple features like edges to more complex concepts. On the other hand, learning to be insensitive to invariances of the task, such as smooth transformations for image datasets, has been argued to be important for deep networks and it strongly correlates with their performance. In this work, we aim to explain this correlation and unify these two viewpoints. We show that by introducing sparsity to generative hierarchical models of data, the task acquires insensitivity to spatial transformations that are discrete versions of smooth transformations. In particular, we introduce the Sparse Random Hierarchy Model (SRHM), where we observe and rationalize that a hierarchical representation mirroring the hierarchical model is learnt precisely when such insensitivity is learnt, thereby explaining the strong correlation between the latter and performance. Moreover, we quantify how the sample complexity of CNNs learning the SRHM depends on both the sparsity and hierarchical structure of the task.">

        <tr id="Learning complex trajectories from demonstrations in robotic tasks has been effectively addressed through the utilization of Dynamical Systems (DS). State-of-the-art DS learning methods ensure stability of the generated trajectories; however, they have three shortcomings: a) the DS is assumed to have a single attractor, which limits the diversity of tasks it can achieve, b) state derivative information is assumed to be available in the learning process and c) the state of the DS is assumed to be measurable at inference time. We propose a class of provably stable latent DS with possibly multiple attractors, that inherit the training methods of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, thus, dropping the dependency on state derivative information. A diffeomorphic mapping for the output and a loss that captures time-invariant trajectory similarity are proposed. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments conducted on a public dataset of handwritten shapes and within a simulated object manipulation task.">

        <tr id="Data-driven, machine learning (ML) models of atomistic interactions are often based on flexible and non-physical functions that can relate nuanced aspects of atomic arrangements into predictions of energies and forces. As a result, these potentials are as good as the training data (usually results of so-called ab initio simulations) and we need to make sure that we have enough information for a model to become sufficiently accurate, reliable and transferable. The main challenge stems from the fact that descriptors of chemical environments are often sparse high-dimensional objects without a well-defined continuous metric. Therefore, it is rather unlikely that any ad hoc method of choosing training examples will be indiscriminate, and it will be easy to fall into the trap of confirmation bias, where the same narrow and biased sampling is used to generate train- and test- sets. We will demonstrate that classical concepts of statistical planning of experiments and optimal design can help to mitigate such problems at a relatively low computational cost. The key feature of the method we will investigate is that they allow us to assess the informativeness of data (how much we can improve the model by adding/swapping a training example) and verify if the training is feasible with the current set before obtaining any reference energies and forces -- a so-called off-line approach. In other words, we are focusing on an approach that is easy to implement and doesn't require sophisticated frameworks that involve automated access to high-performance computational (HPC).">

The basic dynamical mechanism is that inputs to the network generate ongoing activity, which in turn controls how additional inputs or signals propagate spatially or attenuate in time. We present analytical solutions for the steady states when the network is forced with a single oscillation and when a background value creates a steady state of ongoing activity, and derive the relationships shaping the value of the temporal decay and spatial propagation length as a function of this background value.">

        <tr id="Learning a good representation is a crucial challenge for Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. Self-predictive learning provides means to jointly learn a latent representation and dynamics model by bootstrapping from future latent representations (BYOL). Recent work has developed theoretical insights into these algorithms by studying a continuous-time ODE model for self-predictive representation learning under the simplifying assumption that the algorithm depends on a fixed policy (BYOL-$\Pi$); this assumption is at odds with practical instantiations of such algorithms, which explicitly condition their predictions on future actions. In this work, we take a step towards bridging the gap between theory and practice by analyzing an action-conditional self-predictive objective (BYOL-AC) using the ODE framework, characterizing its convergence properties and highlighting important distinctions between the limiting solutions of the BYOL-$\Pi$ and BYOL-AC dynamics. We show how the two representations are related by a variance equation. This connection leads to a novel variance-like action-conditional objective (BYOL-VAR) and its corresponding ODE. We unify the study of all three objectives through two complementary lenses; a model-based perspective, where each objective is shown to be equivalent to a low-rank approximation of certain dynamics, and a model-free perspective, which establishes relationships between the objectives and their respective value, Q-value, and advantage function. Our empirical investigations, encompassing both linear function approximation and Deep RL environments, demonstrates that BYOL-AC is better overall in a variety of different settings.">

        <tr id="We consider the problem of learning the dynamics in the topology of time-evolving point clouds, the prevalent spatiotemporal model for systems exhibiting collective behavior, such as swarms of insects and birds or particles in physics. In such systems, patterns emerge from (local) interactions among self-propelled entities. While several well-understood governing equations for motion and interaction exist, they are difficult to fit to data due to the often large number of entities and missing correspondences between the observation times, which may also not be equidistant. To evade such confounding factors, we investigate collective behavior from a \textit{topological perspective}, but instead of summarizing entire observation sequences (as in prior work), we propose learning a latent dynamical model from topological features \textit{per time point}. The latter is then used to formulate a downstream regression task to predict the parametrization of some a priori specified governing equation. We implement this idea based on a latent ODE learned from vectorized (static) persistence diagrams and show that this modeling choice is justified by a combination of recent stability results for persistent homology. Various (ablation) experiments not only demonstrate the relevance of each individual model component, but provide compelling empirical evidence that our proposed model -- \textit{neural persistence dynamics} -- substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art across a diverse set of parameter regression tasks.">

        <tr id="Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.">

Drawing inspiration from this revelation, we propose a novel method that directly leverages chaotic dynamics for deep learning architectures. Our approach is systematically evaluated across distinct chaotic systems. In all instances, our framework presents superior results to conventional deep neural networks in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and efficiency. Furthermore, we found an active role of transient chaos formation in our scheme.

Conventionally, adjoint solvers need to be implemented by differentiating computational models, which can be a cumbersome task and is code-specific. To propose an adjoint solver that is not code-specific, we develop a data-driven strategy. We demonstrate its application on the computation of gradients of long-time averages of chaotic flows. First, we deploy a parameter-aware echo state network (ESN) to accurately forecast and simulate the dynamics of a dynamical system for a range of system's parameters. Second, we derive the adjoint of the parameter-aware ESN. Finally, we combine the parameter-aware ESN with its adjoint version to compute the sensitivities to the system parameters. We showcase the method on a prototypical chaotic system. Because adjoint sensitivities in chaotic regimes diverge for long integration times, we analyse the application of ensemble adjoint method to the ESN. We find that the adjoint sensitivities obtained from the ESN match closely with the original system. This work opens possibilities for sensitivity analysis without code-specific adjoint solvers.">

We integrate the zeroth-order optimization technique with a typical meta-learning method, proposing an algorithm that omits the estimation of policy Hessian, which applies to tasks of learning a set of heterogeneous but similar linear dynamic systems. The induced meta-objective function inherits important properties of the original cost function when the set of linear dynamic systems are meta-learnable, allowing the algorithm to optimize over a learnable landscape without projection onto the feasible set. We provide a convergence result for the exact gradient descent process by analyzing the boundedness and smoothness of the gradient for the meta-objective, which justify the proposed algorithm with gradient estimation error being small. We also provide a numerical example to corroborate this perspective.">

Here, we investigate the training dynamics of two-layer shallow neural networks trained with gradient-based algorithms, and discuss how they learn pertinent features in multi-index models, that is target functions with low-dimensional relevant directions. In the high-dimensional regime, where the input dimension $d$ diverges, we show that a simple modification of the idealized single-pass gradient descent training scenario, where data can now be repeated or iterated upon twice, drastically improves its computational efficiency. In particular, it surpasses the limitations previously believed to be dictated by the Information and Leap exponents associated with the target function to be learned. Our results highlight the ability of networks to learn relevant structures from data alone without any pre-processing. More precisely, we show that (almost) all directions are learned with at most $O(d \log d)$ steps. Among the exceptions is a set of hard functions that includes sparse parities. In the presence of coupling between directions, however, these can be learned sequentially through a hierarchical mechanism that generalizes the notion of staircase functions. Our results are proven by a rigorous study of the evolution of the relevant statistics for high-dimensional dynamics.">

This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.">

In such context, it is crucial to develop algorithms that are robust to the choice of hyperparameters and to gradients heterogeneity since, in practice, both the choice of step-size and behaviour of target gradients induce hard-to-control biases in the invariant distribution. In this work we introduce the stochastic gradient Barker dynamics (SGBD) algorithm, extending the recently developed Barker MCMC scheme, a robust alternative to Langevin-based sampling algorithms, to the stochastic gradient framework. We characterize the impact of stochastic gradients on the Barker transition mechanism and develop a bias-corrected version that, under suitable assumptions, eliminates the error due to the gradient noise in the proposal. We illustrate the performance on a number of high-dimensional examples, showing that SGBD is more robust to hyperparameter tuning and to irregular behavior of the target gradients compared to the popular stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics algorithm.">

        <tr id="Physics-guided neural networks (PGNN) is an effective tool that combines the benefits of data-driven modeling with the interpretability and generalization of underlying physical information. However, for a classical PGNN, the penalization of the physics-guided part is at the output level, which leads to a conservative result as systems with highly similar state-transition functions, i.e. only slight differences in parameters, can have significantly different time-series outputs. Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.">

        <tr id="A common obstruction to efficient sampling from high-dimensional distributions is the multimodality of the target distribution because Markov chains may get trapped far from stationarity. Still, one hopes that this is only a barrier to the mixing of Markov chains from worst-case initializations and can be overcome by choosing high-entropy initializations, e.g., a product or weakly correlated distribution. Ideally, from such initializations, the dynamics would escape from the saddle points separating modes quickly and spread its mass between the dominant modes. In this paper, we study convergence from high-entropy initializations for the random-cluster and Potts models on the complete graph -- two extensively studied high-dimensional landscapes that pose many complexities like discontinuous phase transitions and asymmetric metastable modes. We study the Chayes--Machta and Swendsen--Wang dynamics for the mean-field random-cluster model and the Glauber dynamics for the Potts model. We sharply characterize the set of product measure initializations from which these Markov chains mix rapidly, even though their mixing times from worst-case initializations are exponentially slow. Our proofs require careful approximations of projections of high-dimensional Markov chains (which are not themselves Markovian) by tractable 1-dimensional random processes, followed by analysis of the latter's escape from saddle points separating stable modes.">

Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

        <tr id="Langevin Dynamics is a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) central to sampling and generative modeling and is implemented via time discretization. Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), based on the Euler-Maruyama discretization, is the simplest and most studied algorithm. LMC can suffer from slow convergence - requiring a large number of steps of small step-size to obtain good quality samples. This becomes stark in the case of diffusion models where a large number of steps gives the best samples, but the quality degrades rapidly with smaller number of steps. Randomized Midpoint Method has been recently proposed as a better discretization of Langevin dynamics for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions. However, important applications such as diffusion models involve non-log concave densities and contain time varying drift. We propose its variant, the Poisson Midpoint Method, which approximates a small step-size LMC with large step-sizes. We prove that this can obtain a quadratic speed up of LMC under very weak assumptions. We apply our method to diffusion models for image generation and show that it maintains the quality of DDPM with 1000 neural network calls with just 50-80 neural network calls and outperforms ODE based methods with similar compute.">

These dynamics are difficult to address because they are nonlinear, chaotic, and are often too fast for active control schemes. In this work, we develop an alternative active controls system using an iterative, trajectory-optimization and parameter-tuning approach based on Iterative Learning Control (ILC), Time-Lagged Phase Portraits (TLPP) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The novelty of this approach is that it can control a system's dynamics despite the controller being much slower than the dynamics. We demonstrate this controller on the Lorenz system of equations where it iteratively adjusts (tunes) the system's input parameters to successfully reproduce a desired oscillatory trajectory or state. Additionally, we investigate the system's dynamical sensitivity to its control parameters, identify continuous and bounded regions of desired dynamical trajectories, and demonstrate that the controller is robust to missing information and uncontrollable parameters as long as certain requirements are met. The controller presented in this work provides a framework for low-speed control for a variety of fast, nonlinear systems that may aid in instability suppression and mitigation.">

Here, we present a novel deep learning framework to estimate the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the function of two-body interactions, thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.">

        <tr id="Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.">

More importantly, we also connect this question to the depth (number of rows) of the Hankel model, showing the simple act of reconfiguring a finite dataset significantly improves accuracy.

        <tr id="Probabilistic models in physics often require from the evaluation of normalized Boltzmann factors, which in turn implies the computation of the partition function Z. Getting the exact value of Z, though, becomes a forbiddingly expensive task as the system size increases. This problem is also present in probabilistic learning models such as the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), where the situation is even worse as the exact learning rules implies the computation of Z at each iteration. A possible way to tackle this problem is to use the Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) algorithm, which provides a tool to stochastically estimate the partition function of the system. So far, the standard application of the AIS algorithm starts from the uniform probability distribution and uses a large number of Monte Carlo steps to obtain reliable estimations of Z following an annealing process. In this work we show that both the quality of the estimation and the cost of the computation can be significantly improved by using a properly selected mean-field starting probability distribution. We perform a systematic analysis of AIS in both small- and large-sized problems, and compare the results to exact values in problems where these are known. As a result of our systematic analysis, we propose two successful strategies that work well in all the problems analyzed. We conclude that these are good starting points to estimate the partition function with AIS with a relatively low computational cost.">

Moreover we exactly characterize the limiting learning rate (as time goes to infinity) for line search in the setting where the data covariance has only two distinct eigenvalues. For noiseless targets, we further demonstrate that the AdaGrad-Norm learning rate converges to a deterministic constant inversely proportional to the average eigenvalue of the data covariance matrix, and identify a phase transition when the covariance density of eigenvalues follows a power law distribution.">

Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise.

We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with an exponent of approximately -0.5, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.">

        <tr id="In modern neuroscience, observing the dynamics of large populations of neurons is a critical step of understanding how networks of neurons process information. Light-field microscopy (LFM) has emerged as a type of scanless, high-speed, three-dimensional (3D) imaging tool, particularly attractive for this purpose. Imaging neuronal activity using LFM calls for the development of novel computational approaches that fully exploit domain knowledge embedded in physics and optics models, as well as enabling high interpretability and transparency. To this end, we propose a model-based explainable deep learning approach for LFM. Different from purely data-driven methods, the proposed approach integrates wave-optics theory, sparse representation and non-linear optimization with the artificial neural network. In particular, the architecture of the proposed neural network is designed following precise signal and optimization models. Moreover, the network’s parameters are learned from a training dataset using a novel training strategy that integrates layer-wise training with tailored knowledge distillation. Such design allows the network to take advantage of domain knowledge and learned new features. It combines the benefit of both model-based and learning-based methods, thereby contributing to superior interpretability, transparency and performance. By evaluating on both structural and functional LFM data obtained from scattering mammalian brain tissues, we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach to achieve fast, robust 3D localization of neuron sources and accurate neural activity identification.">

In continuous state-spaces, controllable and flexible generation of samples with desired properties has been realized using guidance on diffusion and flow models. However, these guidance approaches are not readily amenable to discrete state-space models. Consequently, we introduce a general and principled method for applying guidance on such models. Our method depends on leveraging continuous-time Markov processes on discrete state-spaces, which unlocks computational tractability for sampling from a desired guided distribution. We demonstrate the utility of our approach, Discrete Guidance, on a range of applications including guided generation of images, small-molecules, DNA sequences and protein sequences.">

        <tr id="Divergence measures play a central role and become increasingly essential in deep learning, yet efficient measures for multiple (more than two) distributions are rarely explored. This becomes particularly crucial in areas where the simultaneous management of multiple distributions is both inevitable and essential. Examples include clustering, multi-source domain adaptation or generalization, and multi-view learning, among others. While computing the mean of pairwise distances between any two distributions is a prevalent method to quantify the total divergence among multiple distributions, it is imperative to acknowledge that this approach is not straightforward and necessitates significant computational resources. In this study, we introduce a new divergence measure tailored for multiple distributions named the generalized Cauchy-Schwarz divergence (GCSD). Additionally, we furnish a kernel-based closed-form sample estimator, making it convenient and straightforward to use in various machine-learning applications. Finally, we explore its profound implications in the realm of deep learning by applying it to tackle two thoughtfully chosen machine-learning tasks: deep clustering and multi-source domain adaptation. Our extensive experimental investigations confirm the robustness and effectiveness of GCSD in both scenarios. The findings also underscore the innovative potential of GCSD and its capability to significantly propel machine learning methodologies that necessitate the quantification of multiple distributions.">

        <tr id="Machine learning (ML) provides a great opportunity for the construction of models with improved accuracy in classical molecular dynamics (MD). However, the accuracy of a ML trained model is limited by the quality and quantity of the training data. Generating large sets of accurate ab initio training data can require significant computational resources. Furthermore, inconsistent or incompatible data with different accuracies obtained using different methods may lead to biased or unreliable ML models that do not accurately represent the underlying physics. Recently, transfer learning showed its potential for avoiding these problems as well as for improving the accuracy, efficiency, and generalization of ML models using multifidelity data. In this work, ab initio trained ML-based MD (aML-MD) models are developed through transfer learning using DFT and multireference data from multiple sources with varying accuracy within the Deep Potential MD framework. The accuracy of the force field is demonstrated by calculating rate constants for the H + HO2 → H2 + 3O2 reaction using quasi-classical trajectories. We show that the aML-MD model with transfer learning can accurately predict the rate constants while reducing the computational cost by more than five times compared to the use of more expensive quantum chemistry training data sets. Hence, the aML-MD model with transfer learning shows great potential in using multifidelity data to reduce the computational cost involved in generating the training set for these potentials.">

The issue gets worse when the changing parameters are unobserved, i.e., their value or influence is not directly measurable when collecting data. We introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a framework that encodes said unobserved parameters in a latent context vector as input to a vector field. NCFs leverage differentiability of the vector field with respect to the parameters, along with first-order Taylor expansion to allow any context vector to influence trajectories from other parameters. We validate our method and compare it to established Multi-Task and Meta-Learning alternatives, showing competitive performance in mean squared error for in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluation on the Lotka-Volterra, Glycolytic Oscillator, and Gray-Scott problems.

However, the proximal sampler, which exhibits much faster convergence than Langevin-based algorithms in the deterministic setting Lee et al. (2021), has yet to be explored in its stochastic variants. In this paper, we study the Stochastic Proximal Samplers (SPS) for sampling from non-log-concave distributions. We first establish a general framework for implementing stochastic proximal samplers and establish the convergence theory accordingly. We show that the convergence to the target distribution can be guaranteed as long as the second moment of the algorithm trajectory is bounded and restricted Gaussian oracles can be well approximated. We then provide two implementable variants based on Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), giving rise to SPS-SGLD and SPS-MALA. We further show that SPS-SGLD and SPS-MALA can achieve $\epsilon$-sampling error in total variation (TV) distance within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1/2}\epsilon^{-2})$ gradient complexities, which outperform the best-known result by at least an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1/3})$ factor. This enhancement in performance is corroborated by our empirical studies on synthetic data with various dimensions, demonstrating the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.">

        <tr id="A problem in nonlinear and complex dynamical systems with broad applications is forecasting the occurrence of a critical transition based solely on data without knowledge about the system equations. When such a transition leads to system collapse, as often is the case, all the available data are from the pre-critical regime where the system still functions normally, making the prediction problem challenging. In recent years, a machine-learning based approach tailored to solving this difficult prediction problem, adaptable reservoir computing, has been articulated. This Perspective introduces the basics of this machine-learning scheme and describes representative results. The general setting is that the system dynamics live on a normal attractor with oscillatory dynamics at the present time and, as a bifurcation parameter changes into the future, a critical transition can occur after which the system switches to a completely different attractor, signifying system collapse. To predict a critical transition, it is essential that the reservoir computer not only learns the dynamical "climate" of the system of interest at some specific parameter value but, more importantly, discovers how the system dynamics changes with the bifurcation parameter. It is demonstrated that this capability can be endowed into the machine through a training process with time series from a small number of distinct, pre-critical parameter values, thereby enabling accurate and reliable prediction of the catastrophic critical transition. Three applications are presented: predicting crisis, forecasting amplitude death, and creating digital twins of nonlinear dynamical systems. Limitations and future perspectives are discussed.">

The computational demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated $d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface, enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, and $\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these materials.">

 Deep neural networks give us a powerful method to model the training dataset’s relationship between input and output. We can regard that as a complex adaptive system consisting of many artificial neurons that work as an adaptive memory as a whole. The network’s behavior is training dynamics with a feedback loop from the evaluation of the loss function. We already know the training response can be constant or shows power law-like aging in some ideal situations. However, we still have gaps between those findings and other complex phenomena, like network fragility. To fill the gap, we introduce a very simple network and analyze it. We show the training response consists of some different factors based on training stages, activation functions, or training methods. In addition, we show feature space reduction as an effect of stochastic training dynamics, which can result in network fragility. Finally, we discuss some complex phenomena of deep networks.">

However, these methods often rely on handcrafted rules and sequential optimization. In contrast, deep learning (DL) offers end-to-end trainable models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on various prediction tasks but lack interpretability and interoperability with established neuroscience concepts. We introduce GREEN (Gabor Riemann EEGNet), a lightweight neural network that integrates wavelet transforms and Riemannian geometry for processing raw EEG data. Benchmarking on five prediction tasks (age, sex, eyes-closed detection, dementia diagnosis, EEG pathology) across three datasets (TUAB, CAUEEG, TDBRAIN) with over 5000 participants, GREEN outperformed non-deep state-of-the-art models and performed favorably against large DL models on the CAU benchmark using orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Computational experiments showed that GREEN facilitates learning sparse representations without compromising performance. The modularity of GREEN allows for the computation of classical measures of phase synchrony, such as pairwise phase-locking values, which are found to convey information for dementia diagnosis. The learned wavelets can be interpreted as bandpass filters, enhancing explainability. We illustrate this with the Berger effect, demonstrating the modulation of 8-10 Hz power when closing the eyes. By integrating domain knowledge, GREEN achieves a desirable complexity-performance trade-off and learns interpretable EEG representations. The source code is publicly available.">

However, they often fail to achieve the same level of accuracy as classical methods in solving differential equations. In this paper, we identify two sources of this issue in the case of Cauchy problems: the use of $L^2$ residuals as objective functions and the approximation gap of neural networks. We show that minimizing the sum of $L^2$ residual and initial condition error is not sufficient to guarantee the true solution, as this loss function does not capture the underlying dynamics. Additionally, neural networks are not capable of capturing singularities in the solutions due to the non-compactness of their image sets. This, in turn, influences the existence of global minima and the regularity of the network. We demonstrate that when the global minimum does not exist, machine precision becomes the predominant source of achievable error in practice. We also present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.">

They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learn- ing models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irreg- ular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based mod- els, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experi- ments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.">

Neural operators are neural networks that learn a mapping from the parameter space to the solution space of PDEs from data, and they can also solve the inverse problem of estimating the parameter from the solution. Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

Machine learning methods are promising in significantly accelerating charge density prediction, yet existing approaches either lack accuracy or scalability. We propose a recipe that can achieve both. In particular, we identify three key ingredients: (1) representing the charge density with atomic and virtual orbitals (spherical fields centered at atom/virtual coordinates); (2) using expressive and learnable orbital basis sets (basis function for the spherical fields); and (3) using high-capacity equivariant neural network architecture. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being more than an order of magnitude faster than existing methods. Furthermore, our method enables flexible efficiency-accuracy trade-offs by adjusting the model/basis sizes.">

In this work, we consider iterative methods, which use iterative linear system solvers to approximate marginal likelihood gradients up to a specified numerical precision, allowing a trade-off between compute time and accuracy of a solution. We introduce a three-level hierarchy of marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, and identify that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations. We then propose to amortise computations by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, providing a $\textit{warm start}$. Finally, we discuss the necessary conditions and quantify the consequences of warm starts and demonstrate their effectiveness on regression tasks, where warm starts achieve the same results as the conventional procedure while providing up to a $16 \times$ average speed-up among datasets.">

This approach aims to utilize neural networks to parameterize the implicit function of the signal. However, when representing implicit functions, traditional neural networks such as ReLU-based multilayer perceptrons face challenges in accurately modeling high-frequency components of signals. Recent research has begun to explore the use of Fourier Neural Networks (FNNs) to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we propose Quantum Implicit Representation Network (QIREN), a novel quantum generalization of FNNs. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that QIREN possesses a quantum advantage over classical FNNs. Lastly, we conducted experiments in signal representation, image superresolution, and image generation tasks to show the superior performance of QIREN compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Our work not only incorporates quantum advantages into implicit neural representations but also uncovers a promising application direction for Quantum Neural Networks.">

        <tr id="The renormalization group (RG) constitutes a fundamental framework in modern theoretical physics. It allows the study of many systems showing states with large-scale correlations and their classification in a relatively small set of universality classes. RG is the most powerful tool for investigating organizational scales within dynamic systems. However, the application of RG techniques to complex networks has presented significant challenges, primarily due to the intricate interplay of correlations on multiple scales. Existing approaches have relied on hypotheses involving hidden geometries and based on embedding complex networks into hidden metric spaces. Here, we present a practical overview of the recently introduced Laplacian Renormalization Group for heterogeneous networks. First, we present a brief overview that justifies the use of the Laplacian as a natural extension for well-known field theories to analyze spatial disorder. We then draw an analogy to traditional real-space renormalization group procedures, explaining how the LRG generalizes the concept of"Kadanoff supernodes"as block nodes that span multiple scales. These supernodes help mitigate the effects of cross-scale correlations due to small-world properties. Additionally, we rigorously define the LRG procedure in momentum space in the spirit of Wilson RG. Finally, we show different analyses for the evolution of network properties along the LRG flow following structural changes when the network is properly reduced.">

        <tr id="Transport phenomena (e.g., fluid flows) are governed by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) describing mass, momentum, and energy conservation, and are ubiquitous in many engineering applications. However, deep learning architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the simulation of these PDEs. This paper clearly articulates and then solves this incompatibility. The local-dependency of generic transport PDEs implies that it only involves local information to predict the physical properties at a location in the next time step. However, the deep learning architecture will inevitably increase the scope of information to make such predictions as the number of layers increases, which can cause sluggish convergence and compromise generalizability. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a distributed data scoping method with linear time complexity to strictly limit the scope of information to predict the local properties. The numerical experiments over multiple physics show that our data scoping method significantly accelerates training convergence and improves the generalizability of benchmark models on large-scale engineering simulations. Specifically, over the geometries not included in the training data for heat transferring simulation, it can increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 21.7 \% and that of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by 38.5 \% on average.">

Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.">

Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.">

To decipher their physical laws, we need to bridge between experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Thanks to progress in microscopy and tracking, there is today an abundance of experimental trajectories reflecting these dynamical laws. Inferring physical models from noisy and imperfect experimental data, however, is challenging. Because there are no inference methods that are robust and efficient, model reconstruction from experimental trajectories is a bottleneck to data-driven biophysics. In this Thesis, I present a set of tools developed to bridge this gap and permit robust and universal inference of stochastic dynamical models from experimental trajectories. These methods are rooted in an information-theoretical framework that quantifies how much can be inferred from trajectories that are short, partial and noisy. They permit the efficient inference of dynamical models for overdamped and underdamped Langevin systems, as well as the inference of entropy production rates. I finally present early applications of these techniques, as well as future research directions.">

The free energy of hydration in particular is a well-studied physicochemical property of drug-like molecules and is commonly used to assess and optimise the accuracy of nonbonded parameters in empirical forcefields, and as a fast-to-compute surrogate of performance for protein-ligand binding free energy estimation. Machine learned potentials (MLPs) show great promise as more accurate alternatives to empirical forcefields, but are not readily decomposed into physically motivated functional forms, which has thus far rendered them incompatible with standard alchemical free energy methods that manipulate individual pairwise interaction terms. However, since the accuracy of free energy calculations is highly sensitive to the forcefield, this is a key area in which MLPs have the potential to address the shortcomings of empirical forcefields. In this work, we introduce an efficient alchemical free energy method compatible with MLPs, enabling, for the first time, calculations of biomolecular free energy with \textit{ab initio} accuracy. Using a pretrained, transferrable, alchemically equipped MACE model, we demonstrate sub-chemical accuracy for the hydration free energies of organic molecules.">

To address the challenges, we propose Deep Data Consistency (DDC) to update the data consistency step with a deep learning model when solving inverse problems with diffusion models. By analyzing existing methods, the variational bound training objective is used to maximize the conditional posterior and reduce its impact on the diffusion process. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods in linear and non-linear tasks, DDC demonstrates its outstanding performance of both similarity and realness metrics in generating high-quality solutions with only 5 inference steps in 0.77 seconds on average. In addition, the robustness of DDC is well illustrated in the experiments across datasets, with large noise and the capacity to solve multiple tasks in only one pre-trained model.">

To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

This layer-wise learning is local in nature, being biological plausible. A statistical mechanics analysis shows that the target fermion-pair-distance is a key parameter.

Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems.

We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.">

As a result, these algorithms may search an unnecessarily large space and discover equations that are less accurate or overly complex. In this paper, we propose to leverage symmetry in automated equation discovery to compress the equation search space and improve the accuracy and simplicity of the learned equations. Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming. In experiments across a diverse range of dynamical systems, our approach demonstrates better robustness against noise and recovers governing equations with significantly higher probability than baselines without symmetry.">

        <tr id="In this study, we present a systematic computational investigation to analyze the long debated crystal stability of two well known aspirin polymorphs, labeled as Form I and Form II. Specifically, we developed a strategy to collect training configurations covering diverse interatomic interactions between representative functional groups in the aspirin crystals. Utilizing a state-of-the-art neural network interatomic potential (NNIP) model, we developed an accurate machine learning potential to simulate aspirin crystal dynamics under finite temperature conditions with $\sim$0.46 kJ/mol/molecule accuracy. Employing the trained NNIP model, we performed thermodynamic integration to assess the free energy difference between aspirin Forms I and II, accounting for the anharmonic effects in a large supercell consisting of 512 molecules. For the first time, our results convincingly demonstrated that Form I is more stable than Form II at 300 K, ranging from 0.74 to 1.83 kJ/mol/molecule, aligning with the experimental observations. Unlike the majority of previous simulations based on (quasi)harmonic approximations in a small super cell, which often found the degenerate energies between aspirin I and II, our findings underscore the importance of anharmonic effects in determining polymorphic stability ranking. Furthermore, we proposed the use of rotational degrees of freedom of methyl and ester/phenyl groups in the aspirin crystal, as characteristic motions to highlight rotational entropic contribution that favors the stability of Form I. Beyond the aspirin polymorphism, we anticipate that such entropy-driven stabilization can be broadly applicable to many other organic systems and thus our approach, suggesting our approach holds a great promise for stability studies in small molecule drug design.">

Tracking dynamic functional connectivity is particularly challenging as it requires estimating the structure of the network at each moment as well as how it is shifting through time. In this paper, we describe a general modeling framework and a set of specific models that provides substantially increased statistical power for estimating rhythmic dynamic networks, based on the assumption that for a particular experiment or task, the network state at any moment is chosen from a discrete set of possible network modes. Each model is comprised of three components: (1) a set of latent switching states that represent transitions between the expression of each network mode; (2) a set of latent oscillators, each characterized by an estimated mean oscillation frequency and an instantaneous phase and amplitude at each time point; and (3) an observation model that relates the observed activity at each electrode to a linear combination of the latent oscillators. We develop an expectation-maximization procedure to estimate the network structure for each switching state and the probability of each state being expressed at each moment. We conduct a set of simulation studies to illustrate the application of these models and quantify their statistical power, even in the face of model misspecification.">

We describe the scenarios for the emergence of complex collective behavior, including chaotic oscillations and multistability. We also compare the dynamics of the neural mass model and the exact microscopic system and show that their agreement may be far from perfect.

Theoretically, we observe that reducing the diameter of the domain enhances mixing rates, exhibiting a $\textit{quadratic}$ behavior.

        <tr id="Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators in vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in downstream tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper studies amortized sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free learning objective, relative trajectory balance, for training a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning.">

Although individual methods have been proposed for each of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integrating their solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework that unifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, dataset optimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridging materials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics. We first demonstrate that, for a proposed representation, the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments is a surrogate value for thermodynamic entropy. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropy differences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identify rare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation. Building on these results, we use this general concept of entropy to quantify information in datasets for ML interatomic potentials (IPs), informing compression, explaining trends in testing errors, and evaluating the efficiency of active learning strategies. Finally, we propose a model-free UQ method for MLIPs using information entropy, showing it reliably detects extrapolation regimes, scales to millions of atoms, and goes beyond model errors. This method is made available as the package QUESTS: Quick Uncertainty and Entropy via STructural Similarity, providing a new unifying theory for data-driven atomistic modeling and combining efforts in ML, first-principles thermodynamics, and simulations.">

        <tr id="The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective technique to produce interpretable models of dynamical systems from time-resolved state data via sparse regression. However, to model parameterized systems, SINDy requires data from transient trajectories for various parameter values over the range of interest, which are typically difficult to acquire experimentally. In this work, we extend SINDy to be able to leverage data on fixed points and/or limit cycles to reduce the number of transient trajectories needed for successful system identification. To achieve this, we incorporate the data on these attractors at various parameter values as constraints in the optimization problem. First, we show that enforcing these as hard constraints leads to an ill-conditioned regression problem due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we implement soft constraints by modifying the cost function to be minimized. This leads to the formulation of a multi-objective sparse regression problem where we simultaneously seek to minimize the error of the fit to the transients trajectories and to the data on attractors, while penalizing the number of terms in the model. Our extension, demonstrated on several numerical examples, is more robust to noisy measurements and requires substantially less training data than the original SINDy method to correctly identify a parameterized dynamical system.">

However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. Leveraging these gradients, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stabilities of complex materials systems.">

To address this, we show how the distributed approach offered by vector symbolic architectures (VSAs), which uses high-dimensional random vectors as the smallest units of representation, can be leveraged to embed robust multi-timescale dynamics into attractor-based RSNNs. We embed finite state machines into the RSNN dynamics by superimposing a symmetric autoassociative weight matrix and asymmetric transition terms. The transition terms are formed by the VSA binding of an input and heteroassociative outer-products between states. Our approach is validated through simulations with highly non-ideal weights; an experimental closed-loop memristive hardware setup; and on Loihi 2, where it scales seamlessly to large state machines. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of VSA representations for embedding robust computation with recurrent dynamics into neuromorphic hardware, without requiring parameter fine-tuning or significant platform-specific optimisation. This advances VSAs as a high-level representation-invariant abstract language for cognitive algorithms in neuromorphic hardware.">

Then, we introduce the notion of dependency measures, showing that the latent variable sampled from the diffusion model loses control of the generation process in this situation and that latent diffusion exhibits dependency illusion in the case of shuffled time series. We also analyze the causes of posterior collapse and introduce a new framework based on this analysis, which addresses the problem and supports a more expressive prior distribution. Our experiments on various real-world time-series datasets demonstrate that our new model maintains a stable posterior and outperforms the baselines in time series generation.">

Their poor scaling, however, means that it is hard to study molecules with more than a few atoms accurately, and a major challenge at the moment is the inclusion of the molecular environment. Here, we present a proof of principle for a way to break the two bottlenecks preventing large but accurate simulations. First, the problem of providing the potential energy surfaces for a general system is addressed by parameterizing a standard force field to reproduce the potential surfaces of the molecule's excited-states, including the all-important vibronic coupling. While not shown here, this would trivially enable the use of an explicit solvent. Second, to help the scaling of the nuclear dynamics propagation, a hierarchy of approximations is introduced to the variational multi-configurational Gaussian method that retains the variational quantum wavepacket description of the key quantum degrees of freedom and uses classical trajectories for the remaining in a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics like approach. The method is referred to as force field quantum dynamics (FF-QD), and a two-state ππ*/nπ* model of uracil, excited to its lowest bright ππ* state, is used as a test case.">

Unlike previous approaches, we do not employ the integral relation imposed by unitarity, but instead train FNOs to discover it from many samples of amplitudes with finite partial wave expansions. When trained only on true samples, the FNO correctly predicts (unique or ambiguous) phases of amplitudes with infinite partial wave expansions. When also trained on false samples, it can rate the quality of its prediction by producing a true/false classifying index. We observe that the value of this index is strongly correlated with the violation of the unitarity constraint for the predicted phase, and present examples where it delineates the boundary between allowed and disallowed profiles of the modulus. Our application of FNOs is unconventional: it involves a simultaneous regression-classification task and emphasizes the role of statistics in ensembles of NOs.

        <tr id="Neural networks are lately more and more often being used in the context of data-driven control, as an approximate model of the true system dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) adopts this practise leading to neural MPC strategies. This raises a question of whether the trained neural network has converged and generalized in a way that the learned model encapsulates an accurate approximation of the true dynamic model of the system, thus making it a reliable choice for model-based control, especially for disturbed and uncertain systems. To tackle that, we propose Dropout MPC, a novel sampling-based ensemble neural MPC algorithm that employs the Monte-Carlo dropout technique on the learned system model. The closed loop is based on an ensemble of predictive controllers, that are used simultaneously at each time-step for trajectory optimization. Each member of the ensemble influences the control input, based on a weighted voting scheme, thus by employing different realizations of the learned system dynamics, neural control becomes more reliable by design. An additional strength of the method is that it offers by design a way to estimate future uncertainty, leading to cautious control. While the method aims in general at uncertain systems with complex dynamics, where models derived from first principles are hard to infer, to showcase the application we utilize data gathered in the laboratory from a real mobile manipulator and employ the proposed algorithm for the navigation of the robot in simulation.">

        <tr id="A key property of neural networks driving their success is their ability to learn features from data. Understanding feature learning from a theoretical viewpoint is an emerging field with many open questions. In this work we capture finite-width effects with a systematic theory of network kernels in deep non-linear neural networks. We show that the Bayesian prior of the network can be written in closed form as a superposition of Gaussian processes, whose kernels are distributed with a variance that depends inversely on the network width N . A large deviation approach, which is exact in the proportional limit for the number of data points $P = \alpha N \rightarrow \infty$, yields a pair of forward-backward equations for the maximum a posteriori kernels in all layers at once. We study their solutions perturbatively to demonstrate how the backward propagation across layers aligns kernels with the target. An alternative field-theoretic formulation shows that kernel adaptation of the Bayesian posterior at finite-width results from fluctuations in the prior: larger fluctuations correspond to a more flexible network prior and thus enable stronger adaptation to data. We thus find a bridge between the classical edge-of-chaos NNGP theory and feature learning, exposing an intricate interplay between criticality, response functions, and feature scale.">

        <tr id="Reservoir computing is a machine learning framework that exploits nonlinear dynamics, exhibiting significant computational capabilities. One of the defining characteristics of reservoir computing is its low cost and straightforward training algorithm, i.e. only the readout, given by a linear combination of reservoir variables, is trained. Inspired by recent mathematical studies based on dynamical system theory, in particular generalized synchronization, we propose a novel reservoir computing framework with generalized readout, including a nonlinear combination of reservoir variables. The first crucial advantage of using the generalized readout is its mathematical basis for improving information processing capabilities. Secondly, it is still within a linear learning framework, which preserves the original strength of reservoir computing. In summary, the generalized readout is naturally derived from mathematical theory and allows the extraction of useful basis functions from reservoir dynamics without sacrificing simplicity. In a numerical study, we find that introducing the generalized readout leads to a significant improvement in accuracy and an unexpected enhancement in robustness for the short- and long-term prediction of Lorenz chaos, with a particular focus on how to harness low-dimensional reservoir dynamics. A novel way and its advantages for physical implementations of reservoir computing with generalized readout are briefly discussed.">

We analyzed how the dynamics of neural networks under GM-structured inputs diverge from the predictions of conventional theories based on simple Gaussian structures. A revelation of our work is the observed convergence of neural network dynamics towards conventional theory even with standardized GM inputs, highlighting an unexpected universality. We found that standardization, especially in conjunction with certain nonlinear functions, plays a critical role in this phenomena. Consequently, despite the complex and varied nature of GM distributions, we demonstrate that neural networks exhibit asymptotic behaviors in line with predictions under simple Gaussian frameworks.">

The models establish a diffusion process that perturbs the ground truth data to Gaussian noise and then learn the reverse process to transform noise into data. However, existing denoising methods such as Langevin dynamic and numerical stochastic differential equation solvers enjoy randomness but generate data slowly with a large number of score function evaluations, and the ordinary differential equation solvers enjoy faster sampling speed but no randomness may influence the sample quality. To this end, motivated by the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization methods and the high connection between the model sampling process with the SGD, we propose adaptive momentum sampling to accelerate the transforming process without introducing additional hyperparameters. Theoretically, we proved our method promises convergence under given conditions. In addition, we empirically show that our sampler can produce more faithful images/graphs in small sampling steps with 2 to 5 times speed up and obtain competitive scores compared to the baselines on image and graph generation tasks.">

In this regime the set of global minimizers of the loss is large, and when initialized in a neighbourhood of this zero-loss set a noisy gradient descent algorithm slowly evolves along this set. In some cases this slow evolution has been related to better generalisation properties. We characterize this evolution for the broad class of noisy gradient descent systems in the limit of small step size. Our results show that the structure of the noise affects not just the form of the limiting process, but also the time scale at which the evolution takes place. We apply the theory to Dropout, label noise and classical SGD (minibatching) noise, and show that these evolve on different two time scales. Classical SGD even yields a trivial evolution on both time scales, implying that additional noise is required for regularization. The results are inspired by the training of neural networks, but the theorems apply to noisy gradient descent of any loss that has a non-trivial zero-loss set.">

Existing solutions have relied on biochemical and physical strategies applied to the specimen and are often complex and challenging. Here, we develop spIsoNet, an end-to-end self-supervised deep-learning-based software to address the preferred orientation problem. Using preferred-orientation views to recover molecular information in under-sampled views, spIsoNet improves both angular isotropy and particle alignment accuracy during 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate spIsoNet’s capability of generating near-isotropic reconstructions from representative biological systems with limited views, including ribosomes, β-galactosidases, and a previously intractable hemagglutinin trimer dataset. spIsoNet can also be generalized to improve map isotropy and particle alignment of preferentially oriented molecules in subtomogram averaging. Therefore, without additional specimen-preparation procedures, spIsoNet provides a general computational solution to the preferred orientation problem.">

Such models have been extensively studied from the beginning of XXI century both in statistical physics and control theory. They provide a suitable framework for encoding maps between various manifolds and are capable of learning over spherical and hyperbolic geometries. In addition, they can learn coupled actions of transformation groups (such as special orthogonal, unitary and Lorentz groups). Furthermore, we overview families of probability distributions that provide appropriate statistical models for probabilistic modeling and inference in Geometric Deep Learning. We argue in favor of using statistical models which arise in different Kuramoto models in the continuum limit of particles. The most convenient families of probability distributions are those which are invariant with respect to actions of certain symmetry groups.">

        <tr id="Symbolic Regression (SR) is a widely studied field of research that aims to infer symbolic expressions from data. A popular approach for SR is the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (\sindy) framework, which uses sparse regression to identify governing equations from data. This study introduces an enhanced method, Nested SINDy, that aims to increase the expressivity of the SINDy approach thanks to a nested structure. Indeed, traditional symbolic regression and system identification methods often fail with complex systems that cannot be easily described analytically. Nested SINDy builds on the SINDy framework by introducing additional layers before and after the core SINDy layer. This allows the method to identify symbolic representations for a wider range of systems, including those with compositions and products of functions. We demonstrate the ability of the Nested SINDy approach to accurately find symbolic expressions for simple systems, such as basic trigonometric functions, and sparse (false but accurate) analytical representations for more complex systems. Our results highlight Nested SINDy's potential as a tool for symbolic regression, surpassing the traditional SINDy approach in terms of expressivity. However, we also note the challenges in the optimization process for Nested SINDy and suggest future research directions, including the designing of a more robust methodology for the optimization process. This study proves that Nested SINDy can effectively discover symbolic representations of dynamical systems from data, offering new opportunities for understanding complex systems through data-driven methods.">

Due to its low dimensionality, its analytical and numerical tractability, and its neuronal interpretation, it has been used as a case study to test the performance of different statistical methods in estimating the underlying model parameters. Existing methods, however, often require complete observations, non-degeneracy of the noise or a complex architecture (e.g., to estimate the transition density of the process,"recovering"the unobserved second component), and they may not (satisfactorily) estimate all model parameters simultaneously. Moreover, these studies lack real data applications for the stochastic FHN model. Here, we tackle all challenges (non-globally Lipschitz drift, non-explicit solution, lack of available transition density, degeneracy of the noise, and partial observations) via an intuitive and easy-to-implement sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm. The proposed method relies on a recent computationally efficient and structure-preserving numerical splitting scheme for synthetic data generation, and on summary statistics exploiting the structural properties of the process. We succeed in estimating all model parameters from simulated data and, more remarkably, real action potential data of rats. The presented novel real-data fit may broaden the scope and credibility of this classic and widely used neuronal model.">

The recent success of state-space models (SSMs), a subclass of RNNs, to overcome such difficulties challenges our theoretical understanding. In this paper, we delve into the optimization challenges of RNNs and discover that, as the memory of a network increases, changes in its parameters result in increasingly large output variations, making gradient-based learning highly sensitive, even without exploding gradients. Our analysis further reveals the importance of the element-wise recurrence design pattern combined with careful parametrizations in mitigating this effect. This feature is present in SSMs, as well as in other architectures, such as LSTMs. Overall, our insights provide a new explanation for some of the difficulties in gradient-based learning of RNNs and why some architectures perform better than others.">

        <tr id="Of all the vector fields surrounding the minima of recurrent learning setups, the gradient field with its exploding and vanishing updates appears a poor choice for optimization, offering little beyond efficient computability. We seek to improve this suboptimal practice in the context of physics simulations, where backpropagating feedback through many unrolled time steps is considered crucial to acquiring temporally coherent behavior. The alternative vector field we propose follows from two principles: physics simulators, unlike neural networks, have a balanced gradient flow, and certain modifications to the backpropagation pass leave the positions of the original minima unchanged. As any modification of backpropagation decouples forward and backward pass, the rotation-free character of the gradient field is lost. Therefore, we discuss the negative implications of using such a rotational vector field for optimization and how to counteract them. Our final procedure is easily implementable via a sequence of gradient stopping and component-wise comparison operations, which do not negatively affect scalability. Our experiments on three control problems show that especially as we increase the complexity of each task, the unbalanced updates from the gradient can no longer provide the precise control signals necessary while our method still solves the tasks.

        <tr id="We are interested in investigating the statistical properties of extreme values for strongly correlated variables. The starting motivation is to understand how the strong-correlation properties of power-law distributed processes affect the possibility of exploring the whole domain of a stochastic process (the real axis in most cases) when performing time-average numerical simulations and how this relates to the numerical evaluation of the autocorrelation function. We show that correlations decrease the heterogeneity of the maximum values. Specifically, through numerical simulations we observe that for strongly correlated variables whose probability distribution function decays like a power-law $1/x^\alpha$, the maximum distribution has a tail compatible with a $1/x^{\alpha+2}$ decay, while for i.i.d. variables we expect a $1/x^\alpha$ decay. As a consequence, we also show that the numerically estimated autocorrelation function converges to the theoretical prediction according to a factor that depends on the length of the simulated time-series $n$ according to a power-law: $1/n^{\alpha^\delta}$ with $\delta<1$, This accounts for a very slow convergence rate.">

        <tr id="We study the relaxation of a Brownian particle with long range memory under confinement in one dimension. The particle diffuses in an arbitrary confining potential and resets at random times to previously visited positions, chosen with a probability proportional to the local time spent there by the particle since the initial time. This model mimics an animal which moves erratically in its home range and returns preferentially to familiar places from time to time, as observed in nature. The steady state density of the position is given by the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, as in standard diffusion, while the transient part of the density can be obtained through a mapping of the Fokker-Planck equation of the process to a Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem. Due to memory, the approach at large time toward the steady state is critically self-organised, in the sense that it always follows a sluggish power-law form, in contrast to the exponential decay that characterises Markov processes. The exponent of this power-law depends in a simple way on the resetting rate and on the leading relaxation rate of the Brownian particle in the absence of resetting. We apply these findings to several exactly solvable examples, such as the harmonic, V-shaped and box potentials.">

We solve a simple multi-linear model in this skill-basis, finding analytic expressions for the emergence of new skills, as well as for scaling laws of the loss with training time, data size, model size, and optimal compute ($C$).

        <tr id="Local-nonlocal coupling approaches combine the computational efficiency of local models and the accuracy of nonlocal models. However, the coupling process is challenging, requiring expertise to identify the interface between local and nonlocal regions. This study introduces a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect the regions in which the local and nonlocal models should be used in a coupling approach. This identification process uses the loading functions and provides as output the selected model at the grid points. Training is based on datasets of loading functions for which reference coupling configurations are computed using accurate coupled solutions, where accuracy is measured in terms of the relative error between the solution to the coupling approach and the solution to the nonlocal model. We study two approaches that differ from one another in terms of the data structure. The first approach, referred to as the full-domain input data approach, inputs the full load vector and outputs a full label vector. In this case, the classification process is carried out globally. The second approach consists of a window-based approach, where loads are preprocessed and partitioned into windows and the problem is formulated as a node-wise classification approach in which the central point of each window is treated individually. The classification problems are solved via deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks. The performance of these approaches is studied on one-dimensional numerical examples using F1-scores and accuracy metrics. In particular, it is shown that the windowing approach provides promising results, achieving an accuracy of 0.96 and an F1-score of 0.97. These results underscore the potential of the approach to automate coupling processes, leading to more accurate and computationally efficient solutions for material science applications.">

Recently developed quantum acoustics emphasizing the wave nature of lattice vibrations has enabled the exploration of previously uncharted territories of electron-lattice interaction, not accessible with conventional tools such as perturbation theory. In this context, our agenda here is two-fold. First, we showcase the application of machine learning methods to categorize various interaction regimes within the subtle interplay of electrons and the dynamical lattice landscape. Second, we shed light on a nebulous region of electron dynamics identified by the machine learning approach and then attribute it to transient localization, where strong lattice vibrations result in a momentary Anderson prison for electronic wavepackets, later released by the evolution of the lattice. Overall, our research illuminates the spectrum of dynamics within the Fr\"ohlich model, such as transient localization, which has been suggested as a pivotal factor contributing to the mysteries surrounding strange metals. Furthermore, this paves the way for utilizing time-dependent perspectives in machine learning for designing materials with tailored electron-lattice properties.">

This can be viewed as a hardware limitation (imposed by digital computers). Here we show that natural gradient descent (NGD), a second-order method, can have a similar computational complexity per iteration to a first-order method, when employing appropriate hardware. We present a new hybrid digital-analog algorithm for training neural networks that is equivalent to NGD in a certain parameter regime but avoids prohibitively costly linear system solves. Our algorithm exploits the thermodynamic properties of an analog system at equilibrium, and hence requires an analog thermodynamic computer. The training occurs in a hybrid digital-analog loop, where the gradient and Fisher information matrix (or any other positive semi-definite curvature matrix) are calculated at given time intervals while the analog dynamics take place. We numerically demonstrate the superiority of this approach over state-of-the-art digital first- and second-order training methods on classification tasks and language model fine-tuning tasks.">

 The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, overcoming limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solution. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of two test problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity and the time-dependent cylinder wake. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

        <tr id="Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has showcased its efficacy across a broad spectrum of decision-making problems. However, its performance often degrades under vast combinatorial action space, especially where an action is composed of multiple sub-actions. In this work, we propose an action abstraction based on the compositional structure between a state and sub-actions for improving the efficiency of MCTS under a factored action space. Our method learns a latent dynamics model with an auxiliary network that captures sub-actions relevant to the transition on the current state, which we call state-conditioned action abstraction. Notably, it infers such compositional relationships from high-dimensional observations without the known environment model. During the tree traversal, our method constructs the state-conditioned action abstraction for each node on-the-fly, reducing the search space by discarding the exploration of redundant sub-actions. Experimental results demonstrate the superior sample efficiency of our method compared to vanilla MuZero, which suffers from expansive action space.">

        <tr id="Most works studying representation learning focus only on classification and neglect regression. Yet, the learning objectives and, therefore, the representation topologies of the two tasks are fundamentally different: classification targets class separation, leading to disconnected representations, whereas regression requires ordinality with respect to the target, leading to continuous representations. We thus wonder how the effectiveness of a regression representation is influenced by its topology, with evaluation based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. The IB principle is an important framework that provides principles for learning effective representations. We establish two connections between it and the topology of regression representations. The first connection reveals that a lower intrinsic dimension of the feature space implies a reduced complexity of the representation Z. This complexity can be quantified as the conditional entropy of Z on the target Y, and serves as an upper bound on the generalization error. The second connection suggests a feature space that is topologically similar to the target space will better align with the IB principle. Based on these two connections, we introduce PH-Reg, a regularizer specific to regression that matches the intrinsic dimension and topology of the feature space with the target space. Experiments on synthetic and real-world regression tasks demonstrate the benefits of PH-Reg. Code: https://github.com/needylove/PH-Reg.">

        <tr id="Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the behavior of neural networks by reverse-engineering their internal computations. However, current methods struggle to find clear interpretations of neural network activations because a decomposition of activations into computational features is missing. Individual neurons or model components do not cleanly correspond to distinct features or functions. We present a novel interpretability method that aims to overcome this limitation by transforming the activations of the network into a new basis - the Local Interaction Basis (LIB). LIB aims to identify computational features by removing irrelevant activations and interactions. Our method drops irrelevant activation directions and aligns the basis with the singular vectors of the Jacobian matrix between adjacent layers. It also scales features based on their importance for downstream computation, producing an interaction graph that shows all computationally-relevant features and interactions in a model. We evaluate the effectiveness of LIB on modular addition and CIFAR-10 models, finding that it identifies more computationally-relevant features that interact more sparsely, compared to principal component analysis. However, LIB does not yield substantial improvements in interpretability or interaction sparsity when applied to language models. We conclude that LIB is a promising theory-driven approach for analyzing neural networks, but in its current form is not applicable to large language models.">

Cutoffs in the range of the interaction have also been used for large systems. All these methods require extrapolations. Within Markov-chain Monte Carlo, in thermal equilibrium, the Boltzmann distribution can however be sampled natively without evaluating the total interaction potential. Using as an example the Lennard-Jones interaction, we review past attempts in this direction, and then discuss in detail the class of cell-veto algorithms which make possible fast, native sampling of the Boltzmann distribution without any approximation, extrapolation, or cutoff even for the slowly decaying Coulomb interaction. The computing effort per move remains constant with increasing system size, as we show explicitly. We provide worked-out illustrations and pseudocode representations of the discussed algorithms.

Capitalizing on the unprecedented amount of neuroimaging data, we present a physics-informed deep model to uncover the coupling mechanism between brain structure and function through the lens of data geometry that is rooted in the widespread wiring topology of connections between distant brain regions. Since deciphering the puzzle of self-organized patterns in functional fluctuations is the gateway to understanding the emergence of cognition and behavior, we devise a geometric deep model to uncover manifold mapping functions that characterize the intrinsic feature representations of evolving functional fluctuations on the Riemannian manifold. In lieu of learning unconstrained mapping functions, we introduce a set of graph-harmonic scattering transforms to impose the brain-wide geometry on top of manifold mapping functions, which allows us to cast the manifold-based deep learning into a reminiscent of MLP-Mixer architecture (in computer vision) for Riemannian manifold. As a proof-of-concept approach, we explore a neural-manifold perspective to understand the relationship between (static) brain structure and (dynamic) function, challenging the prevailing notion in cognitive neuroscience by proposing that neural activities are essentially excited by brain-wide oscillation waves living on the geometry of human connectomes, instead of being confined to focal areas.">

MFLD has gained attention due to its connection with noisy gradient descent for mean-field two-layer neural networks. Unlike standard Langevin dynamics, the nonlinearity of the objective functional induces particle interactions, necessitating multiple particles to approximate the dynamics in a finite-particle setting. Recent works (Chen et al., 2022; Suzuki et al., 2023b) have demonstrated the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for MFLD, showing that the gap between the particle system and its mean-field limit uniformly shrinks over time as the number of particles increases. In this work, we improve the dependence on logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) constants in their particle approximation errors, which can exponentially deteriorate with the regularization coefficient. Specifically, we establish an LSI-constant-free particle approximation error concerning the objective gap by leveraging the problem structure in risk minimization. As the application, we demonstrate improved convergence of MFLD, sampling guarantee for the mean-field stationary distribution, and uniform-in-time Wasserstein propagation of chaos in terms of particle complexity.">

These generalizations are useful when connecting observations from a physical system where the transport dynamics are influenced by the geometry of the system, such as obstacles (e.g., incorporating barrier functions in the Lagrangian), and allows practitioners to incorporate a priori knowledge of the underlying system such as non-Euclidean geometries (e.g., paths must be circular). Our contributions are of computational interest, where we demonstrate the ability to efficiently compute geodesics and amortize spline-based paths, which has not been done before, even in low dimensional problems. Unlike prior work, we also output the resulting Lagrangian optimal transport map without requiring an ODE solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formulation on low-dimensional examples taken from prior work. The source code to reproduce our experiments is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/lagrangian-ot.">

        <tr id="To solve problems in domains such as filtering, optimization, and posterior sampling, interacting-particle methods have recently received much attention. These parallelizable and often gradient-free algorithms use an ensemble of particles that evolve in time, based on a combination of well-chosen dynamics and interaction between the particles. For computationally expensive dynamics -- for example, dynamics that solve inverse problems with an expensive forward model -- the cost of attaining a high accuracy quickly becomes prohibitive. We exploit a hierarchy of approximations to this forward model and apply multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques, improving the asymptotic cost-to-error relation. More specifically, we use MLMC at each time step to estimate the interaction term within a single, globally-coupled ensemble. This technique was proposed by Hoel et al. in the context of the ensemble Kalman filter; the goal of the present paper is to study its applicability to a general framework of interacting-particle methods. After extending the algorithm and its analysis to a broad set of methods with fixed numbers of time steps, we motivate the application of the method to the class of algorithms with an infinite time horizon, which includes popular methods such as ensemble Kalman algorithms for optimization and sampling. Numerical tests confirm the improved asymptotic scaling of the multilevel approach.">
