        <tr id="This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) technique—coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD)—that uses delay embedding and a learned Mahalanobis distance to enhance analysis and prediction of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The delay embedding expands the observation space to better capture underlying manifold structures, while the Mahalanobis distance adjusts observations based on the system’s dynamics. This aids in featurizing KMD in cases where good features are not a priori known. We show that FKMD improves predictions for a high-dimensional linear oscillator, a high-dimensional Lorenz attractor that is partially observed, and a cell signaling problem from cancer research.">

        <tr id="Natural dynamical systems can often display various long-term behaviours, ranging from entirely predictable decaying states to unpredictable, chaotic regimes or, more interestingly, highly correlated and intricate states featuring emergent phenomena. That, of course, imposes a level of generality on the models we use to study them. Among those models, coupled oscillators and cellular automata (CA) present a unique opportunity to advance the understanding of complex temporal behaviours because of their conceptual simplicity but very rich dynamics. In this contribution, we review the work completed by our research team over the last few years in the development and application of an alternative information-based characterization scheme to study the emergent behaviour and information handling of nonlinear systems, specifically Adler-type oscillators under different types of coupling: local phase-dependent (LAP) coupling and Kuramoto-like local (LAK) coupling. We thoroughly studied the long-term dynamics of these systems, identifying several distinct dynamic regimes, ranging from periodic to chaotic and complex. The systems were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively, drawing on entropic measures and information theory. Measures such as entropy density (Shannon entropy rate), effective complexity measure, and Lempel–Ziv complexity/information distance were employed. Our analysis revealed similar patterns and behaviours between these systems and CA, which are computationally capable systems, for some specific rules and regimes. These findings further reinforce the argument around computational capabilities in dynamical systems, as understood by information transmission, storage, and generation measures. Furthermore, the edge of chaos hypothesis (EOC) was verified in coupled oscillators systems for specific regions of parameter space, where a sudden increase in effective complexity measure was observed, indicating enhanced information processing capabilities. Given the potential for exploiting this non-anthropocentric computational power, we propose this alternative information-based characterization scheme as a general framework to identify a dynamical system’s proximity to computationally enhanced states. Furthermore, this study advances the understanding of">

        <tr id="A common problem in time-series analysis is to predict dynamics with only scalar or partial observations of the underlying dynamical system. For data on a smooth compact manifold, Takens' theorem proves a time-delayed embedding of the partial state is diffeomorphic to the attractor, although for chaotic and highly nonlinear systems, learning these delay coordinate mappings is challenging. We utilize deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn discrete time maps and continuous time flows of the partial state. Given training data for the full state, we also learn a reconstruction map. Thus, predictions of a time series can be made from the current state and several previous observations with embedding parameters determined from time-series analysis. The state space for time evolution is of comparable dimension to reduced order manifold models. These are advantages over recurrent neural network models, which require a high-dimensional internal state or additional memory terms and hyperparameters. We demonstrate the capacity of deep ANNs to predict chaotic behavior from a scalar observation on a manifold of dimension three via the Lorenz system. We also consider multivariate observations on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, where the observation dimension required for accurately reproducing dynamics increases with the manifold dimension via the spatial extent of the system.">

        <tr id="A central challenge in data-driven model discovery is the presence of hidden, or latent, variables that are not directly measured but are dynamically important. Takens’ theorem provides conditions for when it is possible to augment partial measurements with time delayed information, resulting in an attractor that is diffeomorphic to that of the original full-state system. This diffeomorphism is typically unknown, and learning the dynamics in the embedding space has remained an open challenge for decades. Here, we design a deep autoencoder network to learn a coordinate transformation from the delay embedded space into a new space, where it is possible to represent the dynamics in a sparse, closed form. We demonstrate this approach on the Lorenz, Rössler and Lotka–Volterra systems, as well as a Lorenz analogue from a video of a chaotic waterwheel experiment. This framework combines deep learning and the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics methods to uncover interpretable models within effective coordinates.">

Takens' delay embedding theory provides a way to transform high-dimensional spatial information into temporal information.

The DEFM can accurately predict future information by transforming spatiotemporal information to the delay embeddings of a target variable. The efficacy and precision of the DEFM are substantiated through applications in three spatiotemporally chaotic systems: a 90-dimensional (90D) coupled Lorenz system, the Lorenz 96 system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with inhomogeneity. Additionally, the performance of the DEFM is evaluated on six real-world datasets spanning various fields. Comparative experiments with five prediction methods illustrate the superiority and robustness of the DEFM and show the great potential of the DEFM in temporal information mining and forecasting.">
