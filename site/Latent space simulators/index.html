        <tr id="Small integration time steps limit molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to millisecond time scales. Markov state models (MSMs) and equation-free approaches learn low-dimensional kinetic models from MD simulation data by performing configurational or dynamical coarse-graining of the state space. The learned kinetic models enable the efficient generation of dynamical trajectories over vastly longer time scales than are accessible by MD, but the discretization of configurational space and/or absence of a means to reconstruct molecular configurations precludes the generation of continuous atomistic molecular trajectories. We propose latent space simulators (LSS) to learn kinetic models for continuous atomistic simulation trajectories by training three deep learning networks to (i) learn the slow collective variables of the molecular system, (ii) propagate the system dynamics within this slow latent space, and (iii) generatively reconstruct molecular configurations. We demonstrate the approach in an application to Trp-cage miniprotein to produce novel ultra-long synthetic folding trajectories that accurately reproduce atomistic molecular structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics at six orders of magnitude lower cost than MD. The dramatically lower cost of trajectory generation enables greatly improved sampling and greatly reduced statistical uncertainties in estimated thermodynamic averages and kinetic rates.">

        <tr id="Numerical approximation methods for the Koopman operator have advanced considerably in the last few years. In particular, data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)51 and its generalization, the extended-DMD (EDMD), are becoming increasingly popular in practical applications. The EDMD improves upon the classical DMD by the inclusion of a flexible choice of dictionary of observables which spans a finite dimensional subspace on which the Koopman operator can be approximated. This enhances the accuracy of the solution reconstruction and broadens the applicability of the Koopman formalism. Although the convergence of the EDMD has been established, applying the method in practice requires a careful choice of the observables to improve convergence with just a finite number of terms. This is especially difficult for high dimensional and highly nonlinear systems. In this paper, we employ ideas from machine learning to improve upon the EDMD method. We develop an iterative approximation algorithm which couples the EDMD with a trainable dictionary represented by an artificial neural network. Using the Duffing oscillator and the Kuramoto Sivashinsky partical differential equation as examples, we show that our algorithm can effectively and efficiently adapt the trainable dictionary to the problem at hand to achieve good reconstruction accuracy without the need to choose a fixed dictionary a priori. Furthermore, to obtain a given accuracy, we require fewer dictionary terms than EDMD with fixed dictionaries. This alleviates an important shortcoming of the EDMD algorithm and enhances the applicability of the Koopman framework to practical problems.">

        <tr id="The success of enhanced sampling molecular simulations that accelerate along collective variables (CVs) is predicated on the availability of variables coincident with the slow collective motions governing the long-time conformational dynamics of a system. It is challenging to intuit these slow CVs for all but the simplest molecular systems, and their data-driven discovery directly from molecular simulation trajectories has been a central focus of the molecular simulation community to both unveil the important physical mechanisms and drive enhanced sampling. In this work, we introduce state-free reversible VAMPnets (SRV) as a deep learning architecture that learns nonlinear CV approximants to the leading slow eigenfunctions of the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator that evolves equilibrium-scaled probability distributions through time. Orthogonality of the learned CVs is naturally imposed within network training without added regularization. The CVs are inherently explicit and differentiable functions of the input coordinates making them well-suited to use in enhanced sampling calculations. We demonstrate the utility of SRVs in capturing parsimonious nonlinear representations of complex system dynamics in applications to 1D and 2D toy systems where the true eigenfunctions are exactly calculable and to molecular dynamics simulations of alanine dipeptide and the WW domain protein.">

        <tr id="We investigate learning the eigenfunctions of evolution operators for time-reversal invariant stochastic processes, a prime example being the Langevin equation used in molecular dynamics. Many physical or chemical processes described by this equation involve transitions between metastable states separated by high potential barriers that can hardly be crossed during a simulation. To overcome this bottleneck, data are collected via biased simulations that explore the state space more rapidly. We propose a framework for learning from biased simulations rooted in the infinitesimal generator of the process and the associated resolvent operator. We contrast our approach to more common ones based on the transfer operator, showing that it can provably learn the spectral properties of the unbiased system from biased data. In experiments, we highlight the advantages of our method over transfer operator approaches and recent developments based on generator learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. Importantly, we show that even with datasets containing only a few relevant transitions due to sub-optimal biasing, our approach recovers relevant information about the transition mechanism.">

        <tr id="Markov state models (MSMs) have proven valuable in studying the dynamics of protein conformational changes via statistical analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. In MSMs, the complex configuration space is coarse-grained into conformational states, with dynamics modeled by a series of Markovian transitions among these states at discrete lag times. Constructing the Markovian model at a specific lag time necessitates defining states that circumvent significant internal energy barriers, enabling internal dynamics relaxation within the lag time. This process effectively coarse-grains time and space, integrating out rapid motions within metastable states. Thus, MSMs possess a multiresolution nature, where the granularity of states can be adjusted according to the time-resolution, offering flexibility in capturing system dynamics. This work introduces a continuous embedding approach for molecular conformations using the state predictive information bottleneck (SPIB), a framework that unifies dimensionality reduction and state space partitioning via a continuous, machine learned basis set. Without explicit optimization of the VAMP-based scores, SPIB demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in identifying slow dynamical processes and constructing predictive multiresolution Markovian models. Through applications to well-validated mini-proteins, SPIB showcases unique advantages compared to competing methods. It autonomously and self-consistently adjusts the number of metastable states based on a specified minimal time resolution, eliminating the need for manual tuning. While maintaining efficacy in dynamical properties, SPIB excels in accurately distinguishing metastable states and capturing numerous well-populated macrostates. This contrasts with existing VAMP-based methods, which often emphasize slow dynamics at the expense of incorporating numerous sparsely populated states. Furthermore, SPIB's ability to learn a low-dimensional continuous embedding of the underlying MSMs enhances the interpretation of dynamic pathways. With these benefits, we propose SPIB as an easy-to-implement methodology for end-to-end MSM construction.">

Common features of these systems are that their behaviors are difficult to describe exactly and invariably unmodeled dynamics present challenges in making precise predictions.

In this paper, we present a novel data-driven linear estimator that uses Koopman operator theory to extract finite-dimensional representations of complex nonlinear systems. The extracted model is used together with a deep reinforcement learning network that learns the optimal stepwise actions to predict future states of the original nonlinear system. Our estimator is also adaptive to a diffeomorphic transformation of the nonlinear system which enables transfer learning to compute state estimates of the transformed system without relearning from scratch.">

        <tr id="An issue for molecular dynamics simulations is that events of interest often involve timescales that are much longer than the simulation time step, which is set by the fastest timescales of the model. Because of this timescale separation, direct simulation of many events is prohibitively computationally costly. This issue can be overcome by aggregating information from many relatively short simulations that sample segments of trajectories involving events of interest. This is the strategy of Markov state models (MSMs) and related approaches, but such methods suffer from approximation error because the variables defining the states generally do not capture the dynamics fully. By contrast, once converged, the weighted ensemble (WE) method aggregates information from trajectory segments so as to yield unbiased estimates of both thermodynamic and kinetic statistics. Unfortunately, errors decay no faster than unbiased simulation in WE. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for describing WE that shows that introduction of an element of stratification, as in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS), accelerates convergence. Then, building on ideas from MSMs and related methods, we propose an improved stratification that allows approximation error to be reduced systematically. We show that the improved stratification can decrease simulation times required to achieve a desired precision by orders of magnitude.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modelling techniques provide a method for deriving models of dynamical systems directly from complicated data streams. However, tracking and forecasting such data streams poses a significant challenge to most methods, as they assume the underlying process and model does not change over time. In this paper, we apply one such data-driven method, the Koopman autoencoder (KAE), to high-dimensional oscillatory data to generate a low-dimensional latent space and model, where the system's dynamics appear linear. This allows one to accurately track and forecast systems where the underlying model may change over time. States and the model in the reduced order latent space can then be efficiently updated as new data becomes available, using data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), in a technique we call the KAE EnKF. We demonstrate that this approach is able to effectively track and forecast time-varying, nonlinear dynamical systems in synthetic examples. We then apply the KAE EnKF to a video of a physical pendulum, and achieve a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. By generating effective latent space reconstructions, we find that we are able to construct accurate short-term forecasts and efficient adaptations to externally forced changes to the pendulum's frequency.">

        <tr id="Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.">

Our approach integrates physical priors through an energy-based risk metric in both full and partial knowledge settings. We evaluate the statistical performance of a reduced-rank estimator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) in the partial knowledge setting. Notably, our approach provides learning bounds independent of the state space dimension and ensures non-spurious spectral estimation. Additionally, we elucidate how the distortion between the intrinsic energy-induced metric of the stochastic diffusion and the RKHS metric used for generator estimation impacts the spectral learning bounds.">

That progress prompts our consideration of how one could use such a high dimensional function to extract mechanistic insight.

The elucidation of their conformational ensembles is a challenging problem requiring an integrated use of computational and experimental methods. Molecular simulations are a valuable computational strategy for constructing structural ensembles of disordered proteins but are highly resource-intensive. Recently, machine learning approaches based on deep generative models that learn from simulation data have emerged as an efficient alternative for generating structural ensembles. However, such methods currently suffer from limited transferability when modeling sequences and conformations absent in the training data. Here, we develop a novel generative model that achieves high levels of transferability for intrinsically disordered protein ensembles. The approach, named idpSAM, is a latent diffusion model based on transformer neural networks. It combines an autoencoder to learn a representation of protein geometry and a diffusion model to sample novel conformations in the encoded space. IdpSAM was trained on a large dataset of simulations of disordered protein regions performed with the ABSINTH implicit solvent model. Thanks to the expressiveness of its neural networks and its training stability, idpSAM faithfully captures 3D structural ensembles of test sequences with no similarity in the training set. Our study also demonstrates the potential for generating full conformational ensembles from datasets with limited sampling and underscores the importance of training set size for generalization. We believe that idpSAM represents a significant progress in transferable protein ensemble modeling through machine learning.">

Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs. We show, that for this particular task, RandONets outperform, both in terms of numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, the ``vanilla"DeepOnets.">

To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

Large-scale motions may govern protein structure–function relationship, and numerous transient but stable conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can play a crucial role in biological function. Investigating conformational ensembles to understand regulations and disease-related aggregations of IDPs is challenging both experimentally and computationally. In this paper first an unsupervised deep learning-based model, termed Internal Coordinate Net (ICoN), is developed that learns the physical principles of conformational changes from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Second, interpolating data points in the learned latent space are selected that rapidly identify novel synthetic conformations with sophisticated and large-scale sidechains and backbone arrangements. Third, with the highly dynamic amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ42) monomer, our deep learning model provided a comprehensive sampling of Aβ42’s conformational landscape. Analysis of these synthetic conformations revealed conformational clusters that can be used to rationalize experimental findings. Additionally, the method can identify novel conformations with important interactions in atomistic details that are not included in the training data. New synthetic conformations showed distinct sidechain rearrangements that are probed by our EPR and amino acid substitution studies. The proposed approach is highly transferable and can be used for any available data for training.

Enhanced sampling methods provided avenues to access such crucial rare events, for example key slow conformational changes of biomolecules. However, the bias in enhanced sampling simulations is rarely optimized, and even if they are, the optimization criteria is based on the thermodynamics or Hamiltonian of the system, but do not directly consider molecular kinetics. Here, we introduce a novel enhanced sampling algorithm that adaptively optimizes the bias based on the kinetics of the system for the first time. We identify the optimal bias that minimizes a key physical observable, the mean first passage time (MFPT) from a starting state to a target state. Our algorithm makes use of the relation between biased and unbiased kinetics obtained from discretized Markov state models (MSMs), as established in the dynamic histogram analysis method (DHAM). We demonstrate the applicability of the method for different 1D and 2D analytical potential-based model examples, NaCl dissociation in explicit water, and phosphate unbinding in Ras GTPase. Our algorithm has excellent performance compared with state-of-art enhanced sampling methods in terms of the timescales required to reach the final state in the benchmarking systems. Our findings provide a novel, kinetics-driven enhanced sampling strategy, signatured by a targeted approach to facilitate mapping rare events, with the potential for breakthrough applications in drug discovery and materials science.">

        <tr id="Digital twins require computationally-efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) that can accurately describe complex dynamics of physical assets. However, constructing ROMs from noisy high-dimensional data is challenging. In this work, we propose a data-driven, non-intrusive method that utilizes stochastic variational deep kernel learning (SVDKL) to discover low-dimensional latent spaces from data and a recurrent version of SVDKL for representing and predicting the evolution of latent dynamics. The proposed method is demonstrated with two challenging examples -- a double pendulum and a reaction-diffusion system. Results show that our framework is capable of (i) denoising and reconstructing measurements, (ii) learning compact representations of system states, (iii) predicting system evolution in low-dimensional latent spaces, and (iv) quantifying modeling uncertainties.">

        <tr id="The discovery of linear embedding is the key to the synthesis of linear control techniques for nonlinear systems. In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.">

The approach consists in the construction of a deep neural network model that approximates the solution manifold through a continuously adaptive local basis. In contrast to global methods, such as Principal Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), the adaptivity allows the DOD to overcome the Kolmogorov barrier, making the approach applicable to a wide spectrum of parametric problems. Furthermore, due to its hybrid linear-nonlinear nature, the DOD can accommodate both intrusive and nonintrusive techniques, providing highly interpretable latent representations and tighter control on error propagation. For this reason, the proposed approach stands out as a valuable alternative to other nonlinear techniques, such as deep autoencoders. The methodology is discussed both theoretically and practically, evaluating its performances on problems featuring nonlinear PDEs, singularities, and parametrized geometries.">

In this study, we demonstrate that the transformer, a machine learning model renowned for machine translation and natural language processing, can be effectively adapted to learn the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectory of biologically relevant physicochemical systems. Specifically, by using sequences of time-discretized states from MD trajectories as input, we show that a transformer can learn the complex syntactic and semantic relationships within the trajectory. This enables it to generate kinetically accurate sequences of future states for a diverse set of models and biomolecules of varying complexity. Remarkably, the transformer-based model can predict future states much faster than traditional MD simulations. We show that it is particularly adept at forecasting the time evolution of an out-of-equilibrium active system that do not maintain detailed balance. We demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism inherent in transformers is crucial for capturing the long-range correlations necessary for accurate state-to-state transition predictions. Overall, our results highlight the ability of transformer based machine learning model in generating future states of physicochemical systems with statistical accuracy.">

However, at low temperature, when directly solving a stationary Fokker-Planck equation with more than two metastable states in the generalized potential landscape, the small eigenvalue introduces numerical difficulties due to a large condition number. To overcome these problems, we introduce the IGANN method, which uses a penalty of negative input gradient annealing during the training.

        <tr id="We present a differentiable formalism for learning free energies that is capable of capturing arbitrarily complex model dependencies on coarse-grained coordinates and finite-temperature response to variation of general system parameters. This is done by endowing models with explicit dependence on temperature and parameters and by exploiting exact differential thermodynamic relationships between the free energy, ensemble averages, and response properties. Formally, we derive an approach for learning high-dimensional cumulant generating functions using statistical estimates of their derivatives, which are observable cumulants of the underlying random variable. The proposed formalism opens ways to resolve several outstanding challenges in bottom-up molecular coarse graining dealing with multiple minima and state dependence. This is realized by using additional differential relationships in the loss function to significantly improve the learning of free energies, while exactly preserving the Boltzmann distribution governing the corresponding fine-grain all-atom system. As an example, we go beyond the standard force-matching procedure to demonstrate how leveraging the thermodynamic relationship between free energy and values of ensemble averaged all-atom potential energy improves the learning efficiency and accuracy of the free energy model. The result is significantly better sampling statistics of structural distribution functions. The theoretical framework presented here is demonstrated via implementations in both kernel-based and neural network machine learning regression methods and opens new ways to train accurate machine learning models for studying thermodynamic and response properties of complex molecular systems.">

In this study, we focus on the development of such metrics for viscoelastic fluid flows governed by a large class of linear and nonlinear stress models. To do this, we introduce a kernel function corresponding to a given viscoelastic stress model that implicitly embeds flowfield snapshots into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) whose squared norm equals the total mechanical energy. Working implicitly with lifted representations in the RKHS via the kernel function provides natural and unambiguous metrics for distances and angles between flowfields without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we present a solution to the preimage problem for our kernels, enabling accurate reconstruction of flowfields from their RKHS representations. Through numerical experiments on an unsteady viscoelastic lid-driven cavity flow, we demonstrate the utility of our kernels for extracting energetically-dominant coherent structures in viscoelastic flows across a range of Reynolds and Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, the features extracted by Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) of flowfield snapshots using our kernel functions yield reconstructions with superior accuracy in terms of mechanical energy compared to conventional methods such as ordinary Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with na\"ively-defined state vectors or KPCA with ad-hoc choices of kernel functions.

While drug residence time is just as important as binding affinity, atomiclevel understanding of drug residence times through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been difficult primarily due to the extremely long timescales. Recent advances in rare event sampling have allowed us to reach these timescales, yet predicting protein-ligand residence times remains a significant challenge. Here we present a semi-automated protocol to calculate the ligand residence times across 12 orders of magnitudes of timescales. In our proposed framework, we integrate a deep learning-based method, the state predictive information bottleneck (SPIB), to learn an approximate reaction coordinate (RC) and use it to guide the enhanced sampling method metadynamics. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by applying it to six different protein-ligand complexes with available benchmark residence times, including the dissociation of the widely studied anti-cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) from both wild-type Abl kinase and drug-resistant mutants. We show how our protocol can recover quantitatively accurate residence times, potentially opening avenues for deeper insights into drug development possibilities and ligand recognition mechanisms.

First, a broad probability distribution over families of MJPs, as well as over possible observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we simulate a synthetic dataset of hidden MJPs and their noisy observation process. Second, a neural network model that processes subsets of the simulated observations, and that is trained to output the initial condition and rate matrix of the target MJP in a supervised way. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) model can infer, in a zero-shot fashion, hidden MJPs evolving in state spaces of different dimensionalities. Specifically, we infer MJPs which describe (i) discrete flashing ratchet systems, which are a type of Brownian motors, and the conformational dynamics in (ii) molecular simulations, (iii) experimental ion channel data and (iv) simple protein folding models.

First, we propose the decoder decomposition, which is a post-processing method to connect the latent variables to the coherent structures of flows. Second, we apply the decoder decomposition to analyse the latent space of synthetic data of a two-dimensional unsteady wake past a cylinder. We find that the dimension of latent space has a significant impact on the interpretability of autoencoders. We identify the physical and spurious latent variables. Third, we apply the decoder decomposition to the latent space of wind-tunnel experimental data of a three-dimensional turbulent wake past a bluff body. We show that the reconstruction error is a function of both the latent space dimension and the decoder size, which are correlated. Finally, we apply the decoder decomposition to rank and select latent variables based on the coherent structures that they represent. This is useful to filter unwanted or spurious latent variables, or to pinpoint specific coherent structures of interest. The ability to rank and select latent variables will help users design and interpret nonlinear autoencoders.">

Existing methods aim to reconstruct STTD using low-dimensional models. However, they are limited to data-specific dimensions or source-dependent patterns, restricting them from unifying representations. Here, we present a novel paradigm to address the STTD learning problem by parameterizing STTD as an implicit neural representation. To discern the underlying dynamics in low-dimensional regimes, coordinate-based neural networks that can encode high-frequency structures are employed to directly map coordinates to traffic variables. To unravel the entangled spatial-temporal interactions, the variability is decomposed into separate processes. We further enable modeling in irregular spaces such as sensor graphs using spectral embedding. Through continuous representations, our approach enables the modeling of a variety of STTD with a unified input, thereby serving as a generalized learner of the underlying traffic dynamics. It is also shown that it can learn implicit low-rank priors and smoothness regularization from the data, making it versatile for learning different dominating data patterns. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments in real-world scenarios, showcasing applications from corridor to network scales. Empirical results not only indicate that our model has significant superiority over conventional low-rank models, but also highlight that the versatility of the approach extends to different data domains, output resolutions, and network topologies. Comprehensive model analyses provide further insight into the inductive bias of STTD. We anticipate that this pioneering modeling perspective could lay the foundation for universal representation of STTD in various real-world tasks.">

        <tr id="Autonomous systems often encounter environments and scenarios beyond the scope of their training data, which underscores a critical challenge: the need to generalize and adapt to unseen scenarios in real time. This challenge necessitates new mathematical and algorithmic tools that enable adaptation and zero-shot transfer. To this end, we leverage the theory of function encoders, which enables zero-shot transfer by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical principles of Hilbert spaces. Using this theory, we first present a method for learning a space of dynamics spanned by a set of neural ODE basis functions. After training, the proposed approach can rapidly identify dynamics in the learned space using an efficient inner product calculation. Critically, this calculation requires no gradient calculations or retraining during the online phase. This method enables zero-shot transfer for autonomous systems at runtime and opens the door for a new class of adaptable control algorithms. We demonstrate state-of-the-art system modeling accuracy for two MuJoCo robot environments and show that the learned models can be used for more efficient MPC control of a quadrotor.">

        <tr id="On the forefront of scientific computing, Deep Learning (DL), i.e., machine learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has emerged a powerful new tool for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

        <tr id="Single-molecule experiments provide insight into the motion (conformational dynamics) of individual protein molecules. Usually, a well-defined but coarse-grained intramolecular coordinate is measured and subsequently analysed with the help of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to deduce the kinetics of protein conformational changes. Such approaches rely on the assumption that the microscopic dynamics of the protein evolve according to a Markov-jump process on some network. However, the manifestation and extent of memory in the dynamics of the observable strongly depends on the chosen underlying Markov model, which is generally not known and therefore can lead to misinterpretations. Here, we combine extensive single-molecule plasmon ruler experiments on the heat shock protein Hsp90, computer simulations, and theory to infer and quantify memory in a model-free fashion. Our analysis is based on the bare definition of non-Markovian behaviour and does not require any underlying model. In the case of Hsp90 probed by a plasmon ruler, the Markov assumption is found to be clearly and conclusively violated on timescales up to roughly 50 s, which corresponds roughly to $\sim$50% of the inferred correlation time of the signal. The extent of memory is striking and reaches biologically relevant timescales. This implies that memory effects penetrate even the slowest observed motions. We provide clear and reproducible guidelines on how to test for the presence and duration of memory in experimental single-molecule data.">

        <tr id="Biomolecules often exhibit complex free energy landscapes in which long-lived metastable states are separated by large energy barriers. Overcoming these barriers to robustly sample transitions between the metastable states with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations presents a challenge. To circumvent this issue, collective variable (CV)-based enhanced sampling MD approaches are often employed. Traditional CV selection relies on intuition and prior knowledge of the system. This approach introduces bias, which can lead to incomplete mechanistic insights. Thus, automated CV detection is desired to gain a deeper understanding of the system/process. Analysis of MD data with various machine learning algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)-based approaches have been implemented for automated CV detection. However, their performance has not been systematically evaluated on structurally and mechanistically complex biological systems. Here, we applied these methods to MD simulations of the MFSD2A (Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain 2A) lysolipid transporter in multiple functionally relevant metastable states with the goal of identifying optimal CVs that would structurally discriminate these states. Specific emphasis was on the automated detection and interpretive power of LDA-based CVs. We found that LDA methods, which included a novel gradient descent-based multiclass harmonic variant, termed GDHLDA, we developed here, outperform PCA in class separation, exhibiting remarkable consistency in extracting CVs critical for distinguishing metastable states. Furthermore, the identified CVs included features previously associated with conformational transitions in MFSD2A. Specifically, conformational shifts in transmembrane helix 7 and in residue Y294 on this helix emerged as critical features discriminating the metastable states in MFSD2A. This highlights the effectiveness of LDA-based approaches in automatically extracting from MD trajectories CVs of functional relevance that can be used to drive biased MD simulations to efficiently sample conformational transitions in the molecular system. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE To elucidate the biological mechanisms of pertinent biomolecules, it is crucial to understand their complex free energy landscapes. Such landscapes are often constructed from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using collective variable (CV)-guided enhanced sampling methods. Identifying proper CVs for this task is critical but can be challenging with traditional intuition-based approaches. Here we propose an automated protocol for CV discovery which is based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction of MD data. By applying the protocol to MD simulations of the MFSD2A lysolipid transporter, a structurally and mechanistically complex biological system, we show that LDA-based methods efficiently detect system-specific CVs that accurately classify different metastable states of MFSD2A and are highly interpretable in a detailed structural context.">

This paper introduces a Koopman-inspired framework that leverages neural networks for data-driven learning of the Koopman bases, termed NeuroKoopman Dynamic Causal Discovery (NKDCD), for reliably inferring the Granger causality along with the underlying nonlinear dynamics. NKDCD employs an autoencoder architecture that lifts the nonlinear dynamics to a higher dimension using data-learned bases, where the lifted time series can be reliably modeled linearly. The lifting function, the linear Granger causality lag matrices, and the projection function (from lifted space to base space) are all represented as multilayer perceptrons and are all learned simultaneously in one go. NKDCD also utilizes sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights of the lag matrices, encouraging the model to select only the needed causal dependencies within the data. Through extensive testing on practically applicable datasets, it is shown that the NKDCD outperforms the existing nonlinear Granger causality discovery approaches.">

        <tr id="Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

Recently, recurrent switching dynamical systems have been used to tackle the scale and complexity of these data. However, an important challenge remains in providing insights into the existence and structure of recurrent linear dynamics in neural time series data. Here we test a scalable approach to time-varying autoregression with low-rank tensors to recover the recurrent dynamics in stochastic neural mass models with multiple stable attractors. We demonstrate that the sparse representation of time-varying system matrices in terms of temporal modes can recover the attractor structure of simple systems via clustering. We then consider simulations based on a human brain connectivity matrix in high and low global connection strength regimes, and reveal the hierarchical clustering structure of the dynamics. Finally, we explain the impact of the forecast time delay on the estimation of the underlying rank and temporal variability of the time series dynamics. This study illustrates that prediction error minimization is not sufficient to recover meaningful dynamic structure and that it is crucial to account for the three key timescales arising from dynamics, noise processes, and attractor switching.">

Inspired by the advances in nonlinear ICA, we propose a state-space modeling framework in which we can identify not just the latent states but also the unknown transition function that maps the past states to the present.

We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.">

Training DNNs is posed as an optimization problem to learn network weights or parameters that well-approximate a mapping from input to target data. Multiway data or tensors arise naturally in myriad ways in deep learning, in particular as input data and as high-dimensional weights and features extracted by the network, with the latter often being a bottleneck in terms of speed and memory. In this work, we leverage tensor representations and processing to efficiently parameterize DNNs when learning from high-dimensional data. We propose tensor neural networks (t-NNs), a natural extension of traditional fully-connected networks, that can be trained efficiently in a reduced, yet more powerful parameter space. Our t-NNs are built upon matrix-mimetic tensor-tensor products, which retain algebraic properties of matrix multiplication while capturing high-dimensional correlations. Mimeticity enables t-NNs to inherit desirable properties of modern DNN architectures. We exemplify this by extending recent work on stable neural networks, which interpret DNNs as discretizations of differential equations, to our multidimensional framework. We provide empirical evidence of the parametric advantages of t-NNs on dimensionality reduction using autoencoders and classification using fully-connected and stable variants on benchmark imaging datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10.">

To address this limitation, we propose a methodology that categorizes nucleation pathways into reactive pathways based on the time evolution of constituent atoms. Our approach effectively captures the diverse structural pathways explored by crystallizing Lennard-Jones-like particles and solidifying Ni$_3$Al, providing a more nuanced understanding of nucleating pathways. Moreover, our methodology enables the prediction of the resulting polymorph from each reactive trajectory.

        <tr id="Thanks to their simple architecture, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting interpretable insights from data. However, training RBMs, as other energy-based models, on highly structured data poses a major challenge, as effective training relies on mixing the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations used to estimate the gradient. This process is often hindered by multiple second-order phase transitions and the associated critical slowdown. In this paper, we present an innovative method in which the principal directions of the dataset are integrated into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization procedure. This approach enables efficient sampling of the equilibrium measure via a static Monte Carlo process. By starting the standard training process with a model that already accurately represents the main modes of the data, we bypass the initial phase transitions. Our results show that this strategy successfully trains RBMs to capture the full diversity of data in datasets where previous methods fail. Furthermore, we use the training trajectories to propose a new sampling method, {\em parallel trajectory tempering}, which allows us to sample the equilibrium measure of the trained model much faster than previous optimized MCMC approaches and a better estimation of the log-likelihood.

        <tr id="Learning dynamical systems from sparse observations is critical in numerous fields, including biology, finance, and physics. Even if tackling such problems is standard in general information fusion, it remains challenging for contemporary machine learning models, such as diffusion models. We introduce a method that integrates conditional particle filtering with ancestral sampling and diffusion models, enabling the generation of realistic trajectories that align with observed data. Our approach uses a smoother based on iterating a conditional particle filter with ancestral sampling to first generate plausible trajectories matching observed marginals, and learns the corresponding diffusion model. This approach provides both a generative method for high-quality, smoothed trajectories under complex constraints, and an efficient approximation of the particle smoothing distribution for classical tracking problems. We demonstrate the approach in time-series generation and interpolation tasks, including vehicle tracking and single-cell RNA sequencing data.">

However, sampling these paths via molecular dynamics simulations is computationally prohibitive due to the high-energy barriers between the meta-stable states. Recent machine learning approaches are often restricted to simple systems or rely on collective variables (CVs) extracted from expensive domain knowledge. In this work, we propose to leverage generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to sample transition paths without relying on CVs. We reformulate the problem as amortized energy-based sampling over molecular trajectories and train a bias potential by minimizing the squared log-ratio between the target distribution and the generator, derived from the flow matching objective of GFlowNets. Our evaluation on three proteins (Alanine Dipeptide, Polyproline, and Chignolin) demonstrates that our approach, called TPS-GFN, generates more realistic and diverse transition paths than the previous CV-free machine learning approach.">

To this end, our proposed solution has two main advantages. First, the proposed method only requires the measurement noise to be bounded. Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks.

It has broad applications in fields such as Bayesian inference, financial mathematics, control theory, and shape analysis. However, simulating the diffusion bridge for natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain unresolved. In the paper, we present a solution to this problem by merging score-matching techniques with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to score-matching for the infinite-dimensional bridge. We construct the score to be discretization invariant, which is natural given the underlying spatially continuous process. We conduct a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data, and our method demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution without extra training.">

The learned representation can be used for downstream machine-learning tasks such as clustering and classification. The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality. We show the competitive performance of our method on real-world time-series data with the baselines and demonstrate its effectiveness for symbolic text modeling and RNA sequence clustering.">

        <tr id="Representation learning for the electronic structure problem is a major challenge of machine learning in computational condensed matter and materials physics. Within quantum mechanical first principles approaches, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is the preeminent tool for understanding electronic structure, and the high-dimensional wavefunctions calculated in this approach serve as the building block for downstream calculations of correlated many-body excitations and related physical observables. Here, we use variational autoencoders (VAE) for the unsupervised learning of high-dimensional DFT wavefunctions and show that these wavefunctions lie in a low-dimensional manifold within the latent space. Our model autonomously determines the optimal representation of the electronic structure, avoiding limitations due to manual feature engineering and selection in prior work. To demonstrate the utility of the latent space representation of the DFT wavefunction, we use it for the supervised training of neural networks (NN) for downstream prediction of the quasiparticle bandstructures within the GW formalism, which includes many-electron correlations beyond DFT. The GW prediction achieves a low error of 0.11 eV for a combined test set of metals and semiconductors drawn from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), suggesting that latent space representation captures key physical information from the original data. Finally, we explore the interpretability of the VAE representation and show that the successful representation learning and downstream prediction by our model is derived from the smoothness of the VAE latent space, which also enables the generation of wavefunctions on arbitrary points in latent space. Our work provides a novel and general machine-learning framework for investigating electronic structure and many-body physics.">

We applied our method to study the phase transitions (PT) in the Ising and XY models, and showed that the direct-sampling simulation of our model is as accurate as the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, but more efficient. Moreover, our method can give thermodynamic quantities as differentiable functions of temperature akin to an analytical solution. The free energy aligns closely with the exact one to the second-order derivative, so this inclusion of temperature dependence enables the otherwise biased variational model to capture the subtle thermal effects at the PTs.

The method is agnostic to the definition of the Markov states, whether data-driven (e.g. by spectral clustering) or based on domain knowledge. Variational EM efficiently and organically identifies the number of Markov chains and dynamics of each chain without expensive model comparisons or posterior sampling. The approach is supported by a theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including simulated and observational data sets based on ${\tt Last.fm}$ music listening, ultramarathon running, and gene expression. The results show the new algorithm is competitive with contemporary mixture modeling approaches and powerful in identifying meaningful heterogeneities in time series data.">

        <tr id="Conformational heterogeneity of biological macromolecules is a challenge in single particle averaging (SPA). Current standard practice is to employ classification and filtering methods which may allow a discrete number of conformational states to be reconstructed. However, the conformation space accessible to these molecules is continuous and therefore explored incompletely by a small number of discrete classes. Recently developed heterogeneous reconstruction algorithms (HRAs) to analyse continuous heterogeneity rely on machine learning methods employing low-dimensional latent space representations. The non-linear nature of many of these methods pose challenges to their validation and interpretation, and to identifying functionally relevant conformational trajectories. We believe these methods would benefit from in-depth benchmarking using high quality synthetic data and concomitant ground truth information. Here we present a framework for the simulation and subsequent analysis with respect to ground-truth of cryo-EM micrographs containing conformationally heterogeneous particles whose conformational heterogeneity is sourced from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This synthetic data can then be processed as if it were experimental data allowing aspects of standard SPA workflows, as well as heterogeneous reconstruction methods, to be compared with known groundtruth using available utilities. We will demonstrate the simulation and analysis of several such datasets and present an initial investigation into HRAs.">

The parameters of the OTN and the FTN are not time-dependent and are learned via a minimum cross-entropy criterion over the trajectories. Alternators are versatile. They can be used as dynamical latent-variable generative models or as sequence-to-sequence predictors. When alternators are used as generative models, the FTN produces interpretable low-dimensional latent variables that capture the dynamics governing the observations. When alternators are used as sequence-to-sequence predictors, the FTN learns to predict the observed features. In both cases, the OTN learns to produce sequences that match the data. Alternators can uncover the latent dynamics underlying complex sequential data, accurately forecast and impute missing data, and sample new trajectories. We showcase the capabilities of alternators in three applications. We first used alternators to model the Lorenz equations, often used to describe chaotic behavior. We then applied alternators to Neuroscience, to map brain activity to physical activity. Finally, we applied alternators to Climate Science, focusing on sea-surface temperature forecasting. In all our experiments, we found alternators are stable to train, fast to sample from, yield high-quality generated samples and latent variables, and outperform strong baselines such as neural ODEs and diffusion models in the domains we studied.">

The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.">

Recent advances have shown how to use random feature approximations to achieve scalable, online ensembling of Gaussian processes with desirable theoretical properties and fruitful applications. One key to these methods' success is the inclusion of a random walk on the model parameters, which makes models dynamic. We show that these methods can be generalized easily to any basis expansion model and that using alternative basis expansions, such as Hilbert space Gaussian processes, often results in better performance. To simplify the process of choosing a specific basis expansion, our method's generality also allows the ensembling of several entirely different models, for example, a Gaussian process and polynomial regression. Finally, we propose a novel method to ensemble static and dynamic models together.">

        <tr id="This study presents the extension of the data-driven optimal prediction approach to the dynamical system with control. The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction. We experimentally confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for two Hamiltonian dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="Molecular simulations have assumed a paramount role in the fields of chemistry, biology, and material sciences, being able to capture the intricate dynamic properties of systems. Within this realm, coarse-grained (CG) techniques have emerged as invaluable tools to sample large-scale systems and reach extended timescales by simplifying system representation. However, CG approaches come with a trade-off: they sacrifice atomistic details that might hold significant relevance in deciphering the investigated process. Therefore, a recommended approach is to identify key CG conformations and process them using backmapping methods, which retrieve atomistic coordinates. Currently, rule-based methods yield subpar geometries and rely on energy relaxation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. Conversely, machine learning techniques offer higher accuracy but are either limited in transferability between systems or tied to specific CG mappings. In this work, we introduce HEroBM, a dynamic and scalable method that employs deep equivariant graph neural networks and a hierarchical approach to achieve high-resolution backmapping. HEroBM handles any type of CG mapping, offering a versatile and efficient protocol for reconstructing atomistic structures with high accuracy. Focused on local principles, HEroBM spans the entire chemical space and is transferable to systems of varying sizes. We illustrate the versatility of our framework through diverse biological systems, including a complex real-case scenario. Here, our end-to-end backmapping approach accurately generates the atomistic coordinates of a G protein-coupled receptor bound to an organic small molecule within a cholesterol/phospholipid bilayer.">

While deep neural network models offer promise in approximating the conditional law of such processes, their effectiveness is hindered by the curse of dimensionality caused by the infinite dimensionality and non-smooth nature of these problems. To address this, we propose a two-step solution. Firstly, we develop a stable dimension reduction technique, projecting the law of a reasonably broad class of Volterra process onto a low-dimensional statistical manifold of non-positive sectional curvature. Next, we introduce a sequentially deep learning model tailored to the manifold's geometry, which we show can approximate the projected conditional law of the Volterra process. Our model leverages an auxiliary hypernetwork to dynamically update its internal parameters, allowing it to encode non-stationary dynamics of the Volterra process, and it can be interpreted as a gating mechanism in a mixture of expert models where each expert is specialized at a specific point in time. Our hypernetwork further allows us to achieve approximation rates that would seemingly only be possible with very large networks.">

In this work, we propose to perform TI along an alchemical pathway represented by a trainable neural network, which we term Neural TI. Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a denoising-diffusion objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation. We apply our method to Lennard-Jones fluids, where we report accurate calculations of the excess chemical potential, demonstrating that Neural TI is capable of coupling hundreds of degrees of freedom at once.">

It uses integration-based NIPC to solve the UQ problem and generates the quadrature rule in a desired tensor structure, so that the model evaluations can be efficiently accelerated through the computational graph transformation method, Accelerated Model evaluations on Tensor grids using Computational graph transformations (AMTC). This method is efficient when the model's computational graph possesses a certain type of sparsity which is commonly the case in multidisciplinary problems. However, it faces limitations in high-dimensional cases due to the curse of dimensionality. To broaden its applicability in high-dimensional UQ problems, we propose AS-AMTC, which integrates the AMTC approach with the active subspace (AS) method, a widely-used dimension reduction technique. In developing this new method, we have also developed AS-NIPC, linking integration-based NIPC with the AS method for solving high-dimensional UQ problems. AS-AMTC incorporates rigorous approaches to generate orthogonal polynomial basis functions for lower-dimensional active variables and efficient quadrature rules to estimate their coefficients. The AS-AMTC method extends AS-NIPC by generating a quadrature rule with a desired tensor structure. This allows the AMTC method to exploit the computational graph sparsity, leading to efficient model evaluations. In an 81-dimensional UQ problem derived from an air-taxi trajectory optimization scenario, AS-NIPC demonstrates a 30% decrease in relative error compared to the existing methods, while AS-AMTC achieves an 80% reduction.">

We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the Gaussian Process in which the data plays the role of the energy scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and identify potential universality classes in these models.">

        <tr id="The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) is a data-driven technique employed for uncovering and representing the fundamental dynamics of intricate systems based on observational data. However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm. In the implementation phase, to show the effectiveness of GN-SINDy, we compare its results with DeePyMoD by using a Python package that is prepared for this purpose on numerous PDE discovery">

Leveraging the theory of optimal prediction, we anticipate and then find that belief states are linearly represented in the residual stream of transformers, even in cases where the predicted belief state geometry has highly nontrivial fractal structure. We investigate cases where the belief state geometry is represented in the final residual stream or distributed across the residual streams of multiple layers, providing a framework to explain these observations. Furthermore we demonstrate that the inferred belief states contain information about the entire future, beyond the local next-token prediction that the transformers are explicitly trained on. Our work provides a framework connecting the structure of training data to the computational structure and representations that transformers use to carry out their behavior.">

        <tr id="We consider the problem of making nonparametric inference in multi-dimensional diffusion models from low-frequency data. Statistical analysis in this setting is notoriously challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood and its gradient, and computational methods have thus far largely resorted to expensive simulation-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new computational approach which is motivated by PDE theory and is built around the characterisation of the transition densities as solutions of the associated heat (Fokker-Planck) equation. Employing optimal regularity results from the theory of parabolic PDEs, we prove a novel characterisation for the gradient of the likelihood. Using these developments, for the nonlinear inverse problem of recovering the diffusivity (in divergence form models), we then show that the numerical evaluation of the likelihood and its gradient can be reduced to standard elliptic eigenvalue problems, solvable by powerful finite element methods. This enables the efficient implementation of a large class of statistical algorithms, including (i) preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and Langevin-type methods for posterior sampling, and (ii) gradient-based descent optimisation schemes to compute maximum likelihood and maximum-a-posteriori estimates. We showcase the effectiveness of these methods via extensive simulation studies in a nonparametric Bayesian model with Gaussian process priors. Interestingly, the optimisation schemes provided satisfactory numerical recovery while exhibiting rapid convergence towards stationary points despite the problem nonlinearity; thus our approach may lead to significant computational speed-ups.

PANNs combine the strengths of DNNs (flexibility and efficiency in higher-dimensional approximation) with those of polynomial approximation (rapid convergence rates for smooth functions). To aid in both stable training and enhanced accuracy over a variety of problems, we present (1) a family of orthogonality constraints that impose mutual orthogonality between the polynomial and the DNN within a PANN; (2) a simple basis pruning approach to combat the curse of dimensionality introduced by the polynomial component; and (3) an adaptation of a polynomial preconditioning strategy to both DNNs and polynomials. We test the resulting architecture for its polynomial reproduction properties, ability to approximate both smooth functions and functions of limited smoothness, and as a method for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Through these experiments, we demonstrate that PANNs offer superior approximation properties to DNNs for both regression and the numerical solution of PDEs, while also offering enhanced accuracy over both polynomial and DNN-based regression (each) when regressing functions with limited smoothness.">

By learning from high-quality data, machine-learned interatomic potentials achieve accuracy on par with ab initio and first-principles methods at a fraction of their computational cost. The success of machine-learned interatomic potentials arises from integrating inductive biases such as equivariance to group actions on an atomic system, e.g., equivariance to rotations and reflections. In particular, the field has notably advanced with the emergence of equivariant message-passing architectures. Most of these models represent an atomic system using spherical tensors, tensor products of which require complicated numerical coefficients and can be computationally demanding. This work introduces higher-rank irreducible Cartesian tensors as an alternative to spherical tensors, addressing the above limitations. We integrate irreducible Cartesian tensor products into message-passing neural networks and prove the equivariance of the resulting layers. Through empirical evaluations on various benchmark data sets, we consistently observe on-par or better performance than that of state-of-the-art spherical models.">

Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

Additionally, the advent of multimodal single-cell omics technologies has opened up new avenues for studying interactions within biological systems. However, the high-dimensional, noisy, and sparse nature of single-cell omics data poses significant analytical challenges. Therefore, dimension reduction (DR) techniques play a vital role in analyzing such data. While many DR methods have been developed, each has its limitations. For instance, linear methods like PCA struggle to capture the highly diverse and complex associations between cell types and states effectively. In response, nonlinear techniques have been introduced; however, they may face scalability issues in high-dimensional settings, be restricted to single omics data, or primarily focus on visualization rather than producing informative embeddings for downstream tasks. Here, we formally introduce DCOL (Dissimilarity based on Conditional Ordered List) correlation, a functional dependency measure for quantifying nonlinear relationships between variables. Based on this measure, we propose DCOL-PCA and DCOL-CCA, for dimension reduction and integration of single- and multi-omics data. In simulation studies, our methods outperformed eight other DR methods and four joint dimension reduction (jDR) methods, showcasing stable performance across various settings. It proved highly effective in extracting essential factors even in the most challenging scenarios. We also validated these methods on real datasets, with our method demonstrating its ability to detect intricate signals within and between omics data and generate lower-dimensional embeddings that preserve the essential information and latent structures in the data.">

Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.">

In this paper, we introduce a novel metric called High Rank PCF Distance (HRPCFD) for extended weak convergence based on the high rank path development method from rough path theory, which also defines the characteristic function for measure-valued processes. We then show that such HRPCFD admits many favourable analytic properties which allows us to design an efficient algorithm for training HRPCFD from data and construct the HRPCF-GAN by using HRPCFD as the discriminator for conditional time series generation. Our numerical experiments on both hypothesis testing and generative modelling validate the out-performance of our approach compared with several state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential in broad applications of synthetic time series generation and in addressing classic financial and economic challenges, such as optimal stopping or utility maximisation problems.">

        <tr id="In the gravitational-wave analysis of pulsar-timing-array datasets, parameter estimation is usually performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to explore posterior probability densities. We introduce an alternative procedure that relies instead on stochastic gradient-descent Bayesian variational inference, whereby we obtain the weights of a neural-network approximation of the posterior by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the approximation from the exact posterior. This technique is distinct from simulation-based inference with normalizing flows, since we train the network for a single dataset, rather than the population of all possible datasets, and we require the computation of the data likelihood and its gradient. Unlike Markov Chain methods, our technique can transparently exploit highly parallel computing platforms. This makes it extremely fast on modern graphical processing units, where it can analyze the NANOGrav 15-yr dataset in few tens of minutes, depending on the probabilistic model, as opposed to hours or days with the analysis codes used until now. We expect that this speed will unlock new kinds of astrophysical and cosmological studies of pulsar-timing-array datasets. Furthermore, variational inference would be viable in other contexts of gravitational-wave data analysis as long as differentiable and parallelizable likelihoods are available.">

The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in (Qu et.al, 2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound.

Therefore, it is not surprising that they appear between the components of vectors carrying out multidimensional random walks, such as those describing the trajectories of biomolecules in molecular dynamics simulations. The existence of these correlations does not imply in itself a problem. Still, it can present a problem when the trajectories are analyzed with an algorithm such as the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) because it seeks to maximize correlations without discriminating whether they have physical origin or not. In this Article, we employ random walks occurring on multidimensional harmonic potentials to evaluate the influence of fortuitous correlations in PCA. We demonstrate that, because of them, this algorithm affords misleading results when applied to a single trajectory. The errors do not only affect the directions of the first eigenvectors and their eigenvalues, but the very definition of the molecule’s “essential space” may be wrong. Additionally, the main principal component’s probability distributions present artificial structures which do not correspond with the shape of the potential energy surface. Finally, we show that the PCA of two realistic protein models, human serum albumin and lysozyme, behave similarly to the simple harmonic models. In all cases, the problems can be mitigated and eventually eliminated by doing PCA on concatenated trajectories formed from a large enough number of individual simulations.">

Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.">

        <tr id="The development of interatomic potentials that can effectively capture a wide range of atomic environments is a complex challenge due to several reasons. Materials can exist in numerous structural forms (e.g., crystalline, amorphous, defects, interfaces) and phases (solid, liquid, gas, plasma). Each form may require different treatment in potential modeling to reflect the real physical behavior correctly. Atoms interact through various forces such as electrostatic, van der Waals, ionic bonding, covalent bonding, and metallic bonding, which manifest differently depending on the chemical elements and their electronic structures. Furthermore, the effective interaction among atoms can change with external conditions like temperature, pressure, and chemical environment. Consequently, creating an interatomic potential that performs well across diverse conditions is difficult since optimizing the potential for one set of conditions can lead to a trade-off in the accuracy of predicted properties associated with other conditions. In this paper, we present a method to construct accurate, efficient and transferable interatomic potentials by adapting to the local atomic environment of each atom within a system. The collection of atomic environments of interest is partitioned into several clusters of atomic environments. Each cluster represents a distinctive local environment and is used to define a corresponding local potential. We introduce a many-body many-potential expansion to smoothly blend these local potentials to ensure global continuity of the potential energy surface. This is achieved by computing the probability functions that determine the likelihood of an atom belonging to each cluster.

        <tr id="With the growing interest and applications in machine learning and data science, finding an efficient method to sparse analysis the high-dimensional data and optimizing a dimension reduction model to extract lower dimensional features has becoming more and more important. Orthogonal constraints (Stiefel manifold) is a commonly met constraint in these applications, and the sparsity is usually enforced through the element-wise L1 norm. Many applications can be found on optimization over Stiefel manifold within the area of physics and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel idea by tackling the Stiefel manifold through an nonlinear eigen-approach by first using ADMM to split the problem into smooth optimization over manifold and convex non-smooth optimization, and then transforming the former into the form of nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency (NEPv) which is solved by self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, and the latter can be found to have an closed-form solution through proximal gradient. Compared with existing methods, our proposed algorithm takes the advantage of specific structure of the objective function, and has efficient convergence results under mild assumptions.">

        <tr id="The algorithm ``automated compression of environments'' (ACE) [Nat. Phys. 18, 662 (2022)] provides a versatile way of simulating an extremely broad class of open quantum systems. This is achieved by encapsulating the influence of the environment, which is determined by the interaction Hamiltonian(s) and initial states, into compact process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) representations. The generality of the ACE method comes at high numerical cost. Here, we demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvement of ACE is possible by changing the order of PT-MPO contraction from a sequential to a tree-like scheme. The problem of combining two partial PT-MPOs with large inner bonds is solved by a preselection approach. The drawbacks of the preselection approach are that the MPO compression is suboptimal and that it is more prone to error accumulation than sequential combination and compression. We therefore also identify strategies to mitigate these disadvantages by fine-tuning compression parameters. This results in a scheme that is similar in compression efficiency and accuracy to the original ACE algorithm, yet is significantly faster. Our numerical experiments reach similar conclusions for bosonic and fermionic test cases, suggesting that our findings are characteristic of the combination of PT-MPOs more generally.">

Given a molecular graph and random noise, the generator produces a conformation in two stages. First, it constructs a conformation in a rotation and translation invariant representation—internal coordinates. In the second step, the model predicts the distances between neighboring atoms and performs a few fast optimization steps to refine the initial conformation. The proposed model considers conformation energy, achieving comparable space coverage, and diversity metrics results.">

This phenomenon, known as causal emergence, is quantified by the indicator of effective information. However, two challenges confront this theory: the absence of well-developed frameworks in continuous stochastic dynamical systems and the reliance on coarse-graining methodologies. In this study, we introduce an exact theoretic framework for causal emergence within linear stochastic iteration systems featuring continuous state spaces and Gaussian noise. Building upon this foundation, we derive an analytical expression for effective information across general dynamics and identify optimal linear coarse-graining strategies that maximize the degree of causal emergence when the dimension averaged uncertainty eliminated by coarse-graining has an upper bound. Our investigation reveals that the maximal causal emergence and the optimal coarse-graining methods are primarily determined by the principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamic system's parameter matrix, with the latter not being unique. To validate our propositions, we apply our analytical models to three simplified physical systems, comparing the outcomes with numerical simulations, and consistently achieve congruent results.">

Although there have been tremendous progress in protein structure prediction in recent years due to deep learning, models that can predict the different stable conformations of proteins with high accuracy and structural validity are still lacking. Here, we introduce Diffold, a cutting-edge approach designed for robust sampling of diverse protein conformations based solely on amino acid sequences. This method transforms AlphaFold2 into a diffusion model by implementing a conformation-based diffusion process and adapting the architecture to process diffused inputs effectively. To counteract the inherent conformational bias in the Protein Data Bank, we developed a novel hierarchical reweighting protocol based on structural clustering. Our evaluations demonstrate that Diffold outperforms existing methods in terms of successful sampling and structural validity. The comparisons with long time molecular dynamics show that Diffold can overcome the energy barrier existing in molecular dynamics simulations and perform more efficient sampling. Furthermore, We showcase Diffold’s utility in drug discovery through its application in neural protein-ligand docking. In a blind test, it accurately predicted a novel protein-ligand complex, underscoring its potential to impact real-world biological research. Additionally, we present other modes of sampling using Diffold, including partial sampling with fixed motif, langevin dynamics and structural interpolation.">

Due to their inherent nonlinear dynamics and memory, they can learn unbounded temporal dependencies from data. In a Machine Learning setting, the network's parameters are adapted during a training phase to match the requirements of a given task/problem increasing its computational capabilities. After the training, the network parameters are kept fixed to exploit the learned computations. The static parameters thereby render the network unadaptive to changing conditions, such as external or internal perturbation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how keeping parts of the network adaptive even after the training enhances its functionality and robustness. Here, we utilize the conceptor framework and conceptualize an adaptive control loop analyzing the network's behavior continuously and adjusting its time-varying internal representation to follow a desired target. We demonstrate how the added adaptivity of the network supports the computational functionality in three distinct tasks: interpolation of temporal patterns, stabilization against partial network degradation, and robustness against input distortion. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive networks in machine learning beyond training, enabling them to not only learn complex patterns but also dynamically adjust to changing environments, ultimately broadening their applicability.">

It uses a multidimensional block of tensors (spanning in space and time) for both input and output, capturing the spatiotemporal and interspecies relationship within a tensor. The tensor consists of species that represent different elements in a CFD simulation. To guarantee the error bound of the reconstructed data, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the residual between the original and reconstructed data. This yields a basis matrix, which is then used to project the residual of each instance. The resulting coefficients are retained to enable accurate reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can deliver two orders of magnitude in reduction while still keeping the errors of primary data under scientifically acceptable bounds. Compared to reduction-based approaches based on SZ, our method achieves a substantially higher compression ratio for a given error bound or a better error for a given compression ratio.">

The accept-reject step does not require to know the marginal of the original measure in the collective variable (namely to know the free energy). The obtained algorithm admits several variants, some of them being very close to methods which have been proposed previously in the literature. We show how the obtained acceptance ratio can be expressed in terms of the work which appears in the Jarzynski-Crooks equality, at least for some variants. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the efficiency of the approach on various simple test cases, and allow us to compare the variants of the algorithm.">

In this work, we study time-continuous Markov jump processes on discrete state spaces and investigate their correspondence to state-continuous diffusion processes given by SDEs. In particular, we revisit the $\textit{Ehrenfest process}$, which converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the infinite state space limit. Likewise, we can show that the time-reversal of the Ehrenfest process converges to the time-reversed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This observation bridges discrete and continuous state spaces and allows to carry over methods from one to the respective other setting. Additionally, we suggest an algorithm for training the time-reversal of Markov jump processes which relies on conditional expectations and can thus be directly related to denoising score matching.

More precisely, the input space $\mathfrak X$ is allowed to be a general topological space satisfying only a mild condition ("quasi-Polish"), and the output space can be either another quasi-Polish space $\mathfrak Y$ or a topological vector space $E$.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result which deals with such a wide class of input/output spaces and simultaneously guarantees the numerical feasibility of the ensuing architectures. Finally, we prove an obstruction result which indicates that the category of quasi-Polish spaces is in a certain sense the correct category to work with if one aims at constructing approximating architectures on infinite-dimensional spaces $\mathfrak X$ which, at the same time, have sufficient expressive power to approximate continuous functions on $\mathfrak X$, are specified by a finite number of parameters only and are"stable"with respect to these parameters.">

        <tr id="We discuss Hamiltonian and Liouvillian learning for analog quantum simulation from non-equilibrium quench dynamics in the limit of weakly dissipative many-body systems. We present various strategies to learn the operator content of the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad operators of the Liouvillian. We compare different ans\"atze based on an experimentally accessible"learning error"which we consider as a function of the number of runs of the experiment. Initially, the learning error decreasing with the inverse square root of the number of runs, as the error in the reconstructed parameters is dominated by shot noise. Eventually the learning error remains constant, allowing us to recognize missing ansatz terms. A central aspect of our approach is to (re-)parametrize ans\"atze by introducing and varying the dependencies between parameters. This allows us to identify the relevant parameters of the system, thereby reducing the complexity of the learning task. Importantly, this (re-)parametrization relies solely on classical post-processing, which is compelling given the finite amount of data available from experiments. A distinguishing feature of our approach is the possibility to learn the Hamiltonian, without the necessity of learning the complete Liouvillian, thus further reducing the complexity of the learning task. We illustrate our method with two, experimentally relevant, spin models.">

This makes MMF especially well suited to modeling certain types of graphs with complex multiscale or hierarchical strucutre. While MMF promises to yields a useful wavelet basis, finding the factorization itself is hard, and existing greedy methods tend to be brittle. In this paper, we propose a ``learnable'' version of MMF that carfully optimizes the factorization using metaheuristics, specifically evolutionary algorithms and directed evolution, along with Stiefel manifold optimization through backpropagating errors. We show that the resulting wavelet basis far outperforms prior MMF algorithms and gives comparable performance on standard learning tasks on graphs. Furthermore, we construct the wavelet neural networks (WNNs) learning graphs on the spectral domain with the wavelet basis produced by our MMF learning algorithm. Our wavelet networks are competitive against other state-of-the-art methods in molecular graphs classification and node classification on citation graphs.

For this purpose, we interpret neural networks as time-varying dynamical systems, where the $k$-th layer corresponds to the dynamics at time $k$. A key novelty with respect to prior work is that we use this interpretation to exploit the series interconnection structure of neural networks with a dynamic programming recursion. Nonlinearities, such as activation functions and nonlinear pooling layers, are handled with integral quadratic constraints. If the neural network contains signal processing layers (convolutional or state space model layers), we realize them as 1-D/2-D/N-D systems and exploit this structure as well. We distinguish ourselves from related work on Lipschitz constant estimation by more extensive structure exploitation (scalability) and a generalization to a large class of common neural network architectures. To show the versatility and computational advantages of our method, we apply it to different neural network architectures trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10.">

To bridge this gap, various enhanced sampling techniques have been developed, which are complemented by reweighting techniques to recover the unbiased dynamics. Girsanov reweighting is a reweighting technique that reweights simulation paths, generated by a stochastic MD integrator, without evoking an effective model of the dynamics. Instead, it calculates the relative path probability density at the time resolution of the MD integrator. Efficient implementation of Girsanov reweighting requires that the reweighting factors are calculated on-the-fly during the simulations and thus needs to be implemented within the MD integrator. Here, we present a comprehensive guide for implementing Girsanov reweighting into MD simulations. We demonstrate the implementation in the MD simulation package OpenMM by extending the library openmmtools. Additionally, we implemented a reweighted Markov state model estimator within the time series analysis package Deeptime.">

Hence, to properly model these environments a 3D context is necessary. However, solving chemical kinetics within a 3D hydro simulation is computationally infeasible for a even a modest parameter study. In order to develop a feasible 3D hydro-chemical simulation, the classical chemical approach needs to be replaced by a faster alternative. We present mace, a Machine learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation, as a proof-of-concept work on emulating chemistry in a dynamical environment. Using the context of AGB outflows, we have developed an architecture that combines the use of an autoencoder (to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical network) and a set of latent ordinary differential equations (that are solved to perform the temporal evolution of the reduced features). Training this architecture with an integrated scheme makes it possible to successfully reproduce a full chemical pathway in a dynamical environment. mace outperforms its classical analogue on average by a factor 26. Furthermore, its efficient implementation in PyTorch results in a sub-linear scaling with respect to the number of hydrodynamical simulation particles.">

SST is strongly affected by fine balances between forces and becomes more anisotropic in time for decaying cases. Moreover, there is a limited understanding of the physical phenomena described by some of the terms in the URANS equations. Rather than attempting to model each term separately, it is attractive to explore the capability of machine learning to model groups of terms, i.e., to directly model the force balances. We consider decaying SST which are homogeneous and stably stratified by a uniform density gradient, enabling dimensionality reduction. We consider two time-series ML models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE). Both models perform accurately and are numerically stable in a posteriori tests. Furthermore, we explore the data requirements of the ML models by extracting physically relevant timescales of the complex system. We find that the ratio of the timescales of the minimum information required by the ML models to accurately capture the dynamics of the SST corresponds to the Reynolds number of the flow. The current framework provides the backbone to explore the capability of such models to capture the dynamics of higher-dimensional complex SST flows.">

We focus our study on models based on deep learning that do not require a high amount of data for training, as this is the problem we are trying to address. Specifically in this work we have tested three autoregressive models where two of them are fully based on deep learning and the other one is a hybrid model that combines modal decomposition with deep learning. We ask these models to generate $200$ time-ahead predictions of two datasets coming from a numerical simulation and experimental measurements, where the latter is characterized by being turbulent. We show how the hybrid model generates more reliable predictions in the experimental case, as it is physics-informed in the sense that the modal decomposition extracts the physics in a way that allows us to predict it.">

        <tr id="Formulating dynamical models for physical phenomena is essential for understanding the interplay between the different mechanisms and predicting the evolution of physical states. However, a dynamical model alone is often insufficient to address these fundamental tasks, as it suffers from model errors and uncertainties. One common remedy is to rely on data assimilation, where the state estimate is updated with observations of the true system. Ensemble filters sequentially assimilate observations by updating a set of samples over time. They operate in two steps: a forecast step that propagates each sample through the dynamical model and an analysis step that updates the samples with incoming observations. For accurate and robust predictions of dynamical systems, discrete solutions must preserve their critical invariants. While modern numerical solvers satisfy these invariants, existing invariant-preserving analysis steps are limited to Gaussian settings and are often not compatible with classical regularization techniques of ensemble filters, e.g., inflation and covariance tapering. The present work focuses on preserving linear invariants, such as mass, stoichiometric balance of chemical species, and electrical charges. Using tools from measure transport theory (Spantini et al., 2022, SIAM Review), we introduce a generic class of nonlinear ensemble filters that automatically preserve desired linear invariants in non-Gaussian filtering problems. By specializing this framework to the Gaussian setting, we recover a constrained formulation of the Kalman filter. Then, we show how to combine existing regularization techniques for the ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994, J. Geophys. Res.) with the preservation of the linear invariants. Finally, we assess the benefits of preserving linear invariants for the ensemble Kalman filter and nonlinear ensemble filters.">

We introduce the notions of weakly and strongly invariant laws (WI and SI) on the parameter space of each single unit, corresponding, respectively, to $G$-invariant distributions, and to distributions supported on parameters fixed by the group action (which encode EA). This allows us to define symmetric models compatible with taking $N\to\infty$ and give an interpretation of the asymptotic dynamics of DA, FA and EA in terms of Wasserstein Gradient Flows describing their MF limits. When activations respect the group action, we show that, for symmetric data, DA, FA and freely-trained models obey the exact same MF dynamic, which stays in the space of WI laws and minimizes therein the population risk. We also give a counterexample to the general attainability of an optimum over SI laws. Despite this, quite remarkably, we show that the set of SI laws is also preserved by the MF dynamics even when freely trained. This sharply contrasts the finite-$N$ setting, in which EAs are generally not preserved by unconstrained SGD. We illustrate the validity of our findings as $N$ gets larger in a teacher-student experimental setting, training a student NN to learn from a WI, SI or arbitrary teacher model through various SL schemes. We last deduce a data-driven heuristic to discover the largest subspace of parameters supporting SI distributions for a problem, that could be used for designing EA with minimal generalization error.">

Previous memory reduction techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and ReLoRA, suffer from the limitation of low rank and saddle point issues, particularly during intensive tasks like pre-training. In this paper, we propose Sparse Spectral Training (SST), an advanced training methodology that updates all singular values and selectively updates singular vectors of network weights, thereby optimizing resource usage while closely approximating full-rank training. SST refines the training process by employing a targeted updating strategy for singular vectors, which is determined by a multinomial sampling method weighted by the significance of the singular values, ensuring both high performance and memory reduction. Through comprehensive testing on both Euclidean and hyperbolic neural networks across various tasks, including natural language generation, machine translation, node classification and link prediction, SST demonstrates its capability to outperform existing memory reduction training methods and is comparable with full-rank training in some cases. On OPT-125M, with rank equating to 8.3% of embedding dimension, SST reduces the perplexity gap to full-rank training by 67.6%, demonstrating a significant reduction of the performance loss with prevalent low-rank methods. This approach offers a strong alternative to traditional training techniques, paving the way for more efficient and scalable neural network training solutions.">

        <tr id="To quantify how well theoretical predictions of structural ensembles agree with experimental measurements, we depend on the accuracy of forward models. These models are computational frameworks that generate observable quantities from molecular configurations based on empirical relationships linking specific molecular properties to experimental measurements. Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) is a reweighting algorithm that reconciles simulated ensembles with ensemble-averaged experimental observations, even when such observations are sparse and/or noisy. This is achieved by sampling the posterior distribution of conformational populations under experimental restraints as well as sampling the posterior distribution of uncertainties due to random and systematic error. In this study, we enhance the algorithm for the refinement of empirical forward model (FM) parameters. We introduce and evaluate two novel methods for optimizing FM parameters. The first method treats FM parameters as nuisance parameters, integrating over them in the full posterior distribution. The second method employs variational minimization of a quantity called the BICePs score that reports the free energy of “turning on” the experimental restraints. This technique, coupled with improved likelihood functions for handling experimental outliers, facilitates force field validation and optimization, as illustrated in recent studies (Raddi et al. 2023, 2024). Using this approach, we refine parameters that modulate the Karplus relation, crucial for accurate predictions of J-coupling constants based on dihedral angles (ϕ) between interacting nuclei. We validate this approach first with a toy model system, and then for human ubiquitin, predicting six sets of Karplus parameters for JHNHα3, JHαC′3, JHNCβ3, JHNC′3, JC′Cβ3, JC′C′3. This approach, which does not rely on any predetermined parameterization, enhances predictive accuracy and can be used for many applications.">

The method can be used on today's largest simulations and will be essential to solve the extreme data exploration and analysis challenges posed by the Exascale era. Furthermore, this concept is so flexible, that it will also enable explorative access to observed data. Our concept is based on applying nonlinear dimensionality reduction to learn compact representations of the data in a low-dimensional space. The simulation data is projected onto this space for interactive inspection, visual interpretation, sample selection, and local analysis. We present a prototype using a rotational invariant hyperspherical variational convolutional autoencoder, utilizing a power distribution in the latent space, and trained on galaxies from IllustrisTNG simulation. Thereby, we obtain a natural Hubble tuning fork like similarity space that can be visualized interactively on the surface of a sphere by exploiting the power of HiPS tilings in Aladin Lite.">

This is exacerbated out of equilibrium, where generally little is known about the distribution characterizing simulated configurations. However, modern machine learning algorithms can estimate the probability density characterizing an ensemble of images, given nothing more than sample images assumed to be drawn from this distribution. We show that by mapping system configurations to images, such approaches can be adapted to the efficient estimation of the density, and therefore the entropy, from simulated or experimental data. We then use this idea to obtain entropic limit cycles in a kinetic Ising model driven by an oscillating magnetic field. Despite being a global probe, we demonstrate that this allows us to identify and characterize stochastic dynamics at parameters near the dynamical phase transition.">

        <tr id="State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.">

Their capability to furnish well-calibrated predictions, combined with simple maximum-likelihood training, has established them as appealing solutions for addressing various learning problems, with a particular emphasis on meta-learning. A prominent member of this family, Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNPs), utilizes convolution to explicitly introduce translation equivariance as an inductive bias. However, ConvCNP's reliance on local discrete kernels in its convolution layers can pose challenges in capturing long-range dependencies and complex patterns within the data, especially when dealing with limited and irregularly sampled observations from a new task. Building on the successes of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) for approximating the solution operators of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), we propose Spectral Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (SConvCNPs), a new addition to the NPs family that allows for more efficient representation of functions in the frequency domain.">

        <tr id="Empirically, large-scale deep learning models often satisfy a neural scaling law: the test error of the trained model improves polynomially as the model size and data size grow. However, conventional wisdom suggests the test error consists of approximation, bias, and variance errors, where the variance error increases with model size. This disagrees with the general form of neural scaling laws, which predict that increasing model size monotonically improves performance. We study the theory of scaling laws in an infinite dimensional linear regression setup. Specifically, we consider a model with $M$ parameters as a linear function of sketched covariates. The model is trained by one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using $N$ data. Assuming the optimal parameter satisfies a Gaussian prior and the data covariance matrix has a power-law spectrum of degree $a>1$, we show that the reducible part of the test error is $\Theta(M^{-(a-1)} + N^{-(a-1)/a})$. The variance error, which increases with $M$, is dominated by the other errors due to the implicit regularization of SGD, thus disappearing from the bound. Our theory is consistent with the empirical neural scaling laws and verified by numerical simulation.">

        <tr id="We developed a novel reservoir characterization workflow that addresses reservoir history matching by coupling a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) forward model with a mixture of experts' approach, termed cluster classify regress (CCR). The inverse modelling is achieved via an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman inversion (aREKI) method, ideal for rapid inverse uncertainty quantification during history matching. We parametrize unknown permeability and porosity fields for non-Gaussian posterior measures using a variational convolution autoencoder and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) exotic priors. The CCR works as a supervised model with the PINO surrogate to replicate nonlinear Peaceman well equations. The CCR's flexibility allows any independent machine-learning algorithm for each stage. The PINO reservoir surrogate's loss function is derived from supervised data loss and losses from the initial conditions and residual of the governing black oil PDE. The PINO-CCR surrogate outputs pressure, water, and gas saturations, along with oil, water, and gas production rates. The methodology was compared to a standard numerical black oil simulator for a waterflooding case on the Norne field, showing similar outputs. This PINO-CCR surrogate was then used in the aREKI history matching workflow, successfully recovering the unknown permeability, porosity and fault multiplier, with simulations up to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. Training the PINO-CCR surrogate on an NVIDIA H100 with 80G memory takes about 5 hours for 100 samples of the Norne field. This workflow is suitable for ensemble-based approaches, where posterior density sampling, given an expensive likelihood evaluation, is desirable for uncertainty quantification.">

We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian.

We contribute to these efforts by leveraging recent advances in decomposed linear dynamical systems (dLDS) models. dLDS models neural dynamics in a latent space with a set of linear operators that can be recombined and reused over time, enabling the discovery of multiple parallel neural processes on different timescales. We leverage the ability to identify reused patterns of dynamical neural interactions, which we call “dynamical connectivity,” to 1) identify contextually dependent roles of neurons; 2) discover the underlying variability of neural representations even under discrete behaviors; 3) quantify differences between anatomical, functional, and dynamical connectivity; and 4) learn a single aligned latent space underlying multiple individual worms’ activity. These results highlight the importance of defining a neuron’s functions not solely by its internal activity or place in a time-averaged network, but by its evolving interactions across context-dependent circuits.">

        <tr id="Non-parametric models, such as Gaussian Processes (GP), show promising results in the analysis of complex data. Their applications in neuroscience data have recently gained traction. In this research, we introduce a novel neural decoder model built upon GP models. The core idea is that two GPs generate neural data and their associated labels using a set of low-dimensional latent variables. Under this modeling assumption, the latent variables represent the underlying manifold or essential features present in the neural data. When GPs are trained, the latent variable can be inferred from neural data to decode the labels with a high accuracy. We demonstrate an application of this decoder model in a verbal memory experiment dataset and show that the decoder accuracy in predicting stimulus significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art decoder models. The preceding performance of this model highlights the importance of utilizing non-parametric models in the analysis of neuroscience data.">

        <tr id="Interpretable mathematical expressions defining discrete-time dynamical systems (iterated maps) can model many phenomena of scientific interest, enabling a deeper understanding of system behaviors. Since formulating governing expressions from first principles can be difficult, it is of particular interest to identify expressions for iterated maps given only their data streams. In this work, we consider a modified Symbolic Artificial Neural Network-Trained Expressions (SymANNTEx) architecture for this task, an architecture more expressive than others in the literature. We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented. We show that our modified SymANNTEx model properly identifies single-state maps and achieves moderate success in approximating a dual-state attractor. These performances offer significant promise for data-driven scientific discovery and interpretation.">

Our approach preserves probability exactly and allows us to evaluate expectation values of analytical observables to in principle arbitrary accuracy; to showcase this, we derive perturbation expansions for the moments of the spatial increment, the finite-time Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and the mean medium entropy production rate. For an explicit multiplicative-noise system with available analytical solution, we validate all our perturbative results. Throughout, we compare our perturbative results to those obtained from the widely used Gaussian approximation of the short-time propagator; we demonstrate that this Gaussian propagator leads to errors that can be many orders of magnitude larger than those resulting from our perturbation approach.

        <tr id="Entropy production (EP) is a central quantity in nonequilibrium physics as it monitors energy dissipation, reversibility, and free energy differences during thermodynamic transformations. Estimating EP, however, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally due to limited access to the system dynamics. For overdamped Langevin dynamics and Markov jump processes it was recently proposed that, from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TUR), short-time cumulant currents can be used to estimate EP without knowledge of the dynamics. Yet, estimation of EP in underdamped Langevin systems remains an active challenge. To address this, we derive a modified TUR that relates the statistics of two specific novel currents -- one cumulant current and one stochastic current -- to a system's EP. These two distinct but related currents are used to constrain EP in the modified TUR. One highlight is that there always exists a family of currents such that the uncertainty relations saturate, even for long-time averages and in nonsteady-state scenarios. Another is that our method only requires limited knowledge of the dynamics -- specifically, the damping-coefficient to mass ratio and the diffusion constant. This uncertainty relation allows estimating EP for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We validate the method numerically, through applications to several underdamped systems, to underscore the flexibility in obtaining EP in nonequilibrium Langevin systems.">

LayerNorm is defined relative to a distinguished 'neural' basis, but it does more than just normalize the corresponding vector elements. Rather, it implements a composition -- of linear projection, nonlinear scaling, and then affine transformation -- on input activation vectors. We develop both a new mathematical expression and geometric intuition, to make the net effect more transparent. We emphasize that, when LayerNorm acts on an N-dimensional vector space, all outcomes of LayerNorm lie within the intersection of an (N-1)-dimensional hyperplane and the interior of an N-dimensional hyperellipsoid. This intersection is the interior of an (N-1)-dimensional hyperellipsoid, and typical inputs are mapped near its surface. We find the direction and length of the principal axes of this (N-1)-dimensional hyperellipsoid via the eigen-decomposition of a simply constructed matrix.">

        <tr id="In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces, but in a learning equilibrium, the problem can be linearized and reduced to many weakly coupled one-dimensional problems. We use the duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distributions of fluctuations of the trainable variables. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.">

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for approximating the distribution of complex data. It is known that data passing through a trained DNN classifier undergoes a series of geometric and topological simplifications. While some progress has been made toward understanding these transformations in neural networks with smooth activation functions, an understanding in the more general setting of non-smooth activation functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which tend to perform better, is required. Here we propose that the geometric transformations performed by DNNs during classification tasks have parallels to those expected under Hamilton's Ricci flow - a tool from differential geometry that evolves a manifold by smoothing its curvature, in order to identify its topology. To illustrate this idea, we present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a DNN, and use this framework to motivate a notion of `global Ricci network flow' that can be used to assess a DNN's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems. By training more than $1,500$ DNN classifiers of different widths and depths on synthetic and real-world data, we show that the strength of global Ricci network flow-like behaviour correlates with accuracy for well-trained DNNs, independently of depth, width and data set. Our findings motivate the use of tools from differential and discrete geometry to the problem of explainability in deep learning.">

We already know the training response can be constant or shows power law-like aging in some ideal situations. However, we still have gaps between those findings and other complex phenomena, like network fragility. To fill the gap, we introduce a very simple network and analyze it. We show the training response consists of some different factors based on training stages, activation functions, or training methods. In addition, we show feature space reduction as an effect of stochastic training dynamics, which can result in network fragility. Finally, we discuss some complex phenomena of deep networks.">

In the space of delayed observations of this motion, we reconstruct a low-dimensional attracting spectral submanifold (SSM) whose internal dynamics serves as a mathematically justified reduced-order model for nearby motions of the full system. We obtain this model in a simple polynomial form that allows explicit identification of important physical system parameters, such as natural frequencies, linear and nonlinear damping and nonlinear stiffness. Beyond faithfully reproducing attracting steady states and limit cycles, our SSM-reduced models can also uncover hidden motion not seen in the video, such as unstable fixed points and unstable limit cycles forming basin boundaries. We demonstrate all these features on experimental videos of five physical systems: a double pendulum, an inverted flag in counter-flow, water sloshing in tank, a wing exhibiting aeroelastic flutter and a shimmying wheel.">

Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. The DeepOKAN is used to develop surrogates for different mechanics problems.

We develop a dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently solves the likelihood, decoding, and parameter learning problems for tree-based HMMs with coupled branches. Our approach scales polynomially with the number of states and nodes, making it computationally feasible for a wide range of applications and does not suffer from the underflow problem. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to simulated data and propose self-consistency checks for validating the assumptions of the model used for inference.

        <tr id="Numerous applications in biology, statistics, science, and engineering require generating samples from high-dimensional probability distributions. In recent years, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method has emerged as a state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, exploiting the shape of such high-dimensional target distributions to efficiently generate samples. Despite its impressive empirical success and increasing popularity, its wide-scale adoption remains limited due to the high computational cost of gradient calculation. Moreover, applying this method is impossible when the gradient of the posterior cannot be computed (for example, with black-box simulators). To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with a surrogate model. In this multi-fidelity algorithm, the acceptance probability is computed in the first stage via a standard HMC proposal using an inexpensive differentiable surrogate model, and if the proposal is accepted, the posterior is evaluated in the second stage using the high-fidelity (HF) numerical solver. Splitting the standard HMC algorithm into these two stages allows for approximating the gradient of the posterior efficiently, while producing accurate posterior samples by using HF numerical solvers in the second stage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm for a range of problems, including linear and nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems with in-silico data and experimental data. The proposed algorithm is shown to seamlessly integrate with various low-fidelity and HF models, priors, and datasets. Remarkably, our proposed method outperforms the traditional HMC algorithm in both computational and statistical efficiency by several orders of magnitude, all while retaining or improving the accuracy in computed posterior statistics.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse domains, becoming the state-of-the-art solution for addressing sequential machine learning problems. Even though we have a general understanding of the fundamental components in the transformer architecture, little is known about how they operate or what are their expected dynamics. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the relationship between attention mechanisms and Hopfield networks, promising to shed light on the statistical physics of transformer networks. However, to date, the dynamical regimes of transformer-like models have not been studied in depth. In this paper, we address this gap by using methods for the study of asymmetric Hopfield networks in nonequilibrium regimes --namely path integral methods over generating functionals, yielding dynamics governed by concurrent mean-field variables. Assuming 1-bit tokens and weights, we derive analytical approximations for the behavior of large self-attention neural networks coupled to a softmax output, which become exact in the large limit size. Our findings reveal nontrivial dynamical phenomena, including nonequilibrium phase transitions associated with chaotic bifurcations, even for very simple configurations with a few encoded features and a very short context window. Finally, we discuss the potential of our analytic approach to improve our understanding of the inner workings of transformer models, potentially reducing computational training costs and enhancing model interpretability.">

        <tr id="Bistable autonomous systems can be found in many areas of science. When the intrinsic noise intensity is large, these systems exhibits stochastic transitions from one metastable steady state to another. In electronic bistable memories, these transitions are failures, usually simulated in a Monte-Carlo fashion at a high CPU-time price. Existing closed-form formulas, relying on near-stable-steady-state approximations of the nonlinear system dynamics to estimate the mean transition time, have turned out inaccurate. Our contribution is twofold. From a unidimensional stochastic model of overdamped autonomous systems, we propose an extended Eyring-Kramers analytical formula accounting for both nonlinear drift and state-dependent white noise variance, rigorously derived from Itô stochastic calculus. We also adapt it to practical system engineering situations where the intrinsic noise sources are hidden and can only be inferred from the fluctuations of observables measured in steady states. First numerical trials on an industrial electronic case study suggest that our approximate prediction formula achieve remarkable accuracy, outperforming previous non-Monte-Carlo approaches.">

This theory provides universal, exact relations for quantities like work, which have been verified in experiments where a fully resolved description allows direct access to such quantities. Complementary studies consider partially hidden, coarse-grained descriptions, in which the mean entropy production typically is not directly accessible but can be bounded in terms of observable quantities. Going beyond the mean, we introduce a fluctuating entropy production that applies to individual trajectories in a coarse-grained description under time-dependent driving. Thus, this concept is applicable to the broad and experimentally significant class of driven systems in which not all relevant states can be resolved. We provide a paradigmatic example by studying an experimentally verified protein unfolding process. As a consequence, the entire distribution of the coarse-grained entropy production rather than merely its mean retains spatial and temporal information about the microscopic process. In particular, we obtain a bound on the distribution of the physical entropy production of individual unfolding events.">

We study this question for synthetic datasets generated via a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) -- a hierarchical generative model that captures the tree-like structure of natural languages. We determine token-token correlations analytically in our model and show that they can be used to build a representation of the grammar's hidden variables, the longer the range the deeper the variable. In addition, a finite training set limits the resolution of correlations to an effective range, whose size grows with that of the training set. As a result, a Language Model trained with increasingly many examples can build a deeper representation of the grammar's structure, thus reaching good performance despite the high dimensionality of the problem. We conjecture that the relationship between training set size and effective range of correlations holds beyond our synthetic datasets. In particular, our conjecture predicts how the scaling law for the test loss behaviour with training set size depends on the length of the context window, which we confirm empirically for a collection of lines from Shakespeare's plays.">

The continuous-mixture autoregressive networks (CANs) enable the construction of accurate effective actions with tractable probability density estimation. Our numerical results demonstrate that this methodology not only facilitates the construction of effective actions at specified temperatures but also adeptly estimates the action at intermediate temperatures using data from both lower and higher temperature ensembles.

        <tr id="While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature learning only occurs with balanced initializations, where all layers learn at similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced initializations to enhance efficient feature learning.">

        <tr id="Identifying latent interactions within complex systems is key to unlocking deeper insights into their operational dynamics, including how their elements affect each other and contribute to the overall system behavior. For instance, in neuroscience, discovering neuron-to-neuron interactions is essential for understanding brain function; in ecology, recognizing the interactions among populations is key for understanding complex ecosystems. Such systems, often modeled as dynamical systems, typically exhibit noisy high-dimensional and non-stationary temporal behavior that renders their identification challenging. Existing dynamical system identification methods often yield operators that accurately capture short-term behavior but fail to predict long-term trends, suggesting an incomplete capture of the underlying process. Methods that consider extended forecasts (e.g., recurrent neural networks) lack explicit representations of element-wise interactions and require substantial training data, thereby failing to capture interpretable network operators. Here we introduce Lookahead-driven Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability (LINOCS), a robust learning procedure for identifying hidden dynamical interactions in noisy time-series data. LINOCS integrates several multi-step predictions with adaptive weights during training to recover dynamical operators that can yield accurate long-term predictions. We demonstrate LINOCS' ability to recover the ground truth dynamical operators underlying synthetic time-series data for multiple dynamical systems models (including linear, piece-wise linear, time-changing linear systems' decomposition, and regularized linear time-varying systems) as well as its capability to produce meaningful operators with robust reconstructions through various real-world examples.">

Specifically, researchers model spiking rates as Gaussian observations, resulting in tractable inference. Recently, GPFA has been extended to model spike count data. However, due to the non-conjugacy of the likelihood, the inference becomes intractable. Prior works rely on either black-box inference techniques, numerical integration or polynomial approximations of the likelihood to handle intractability. To overcome this challenge, we propose a conditionally-conjugate Gaussian process factor analysis (ccGPFA) resulting in both analytically and computationally tractable inference for modeling neural activity from spike count data. In particular, we develop a novel data augmentation based method that renders the model conditionally conjugate. Consequently, our model enjoys the advantage of simple closed-form updates using a variational EM algorithm. Furthermore, due to its conditional conjugacy, we show our model can be readily scaled using sparse Gaussian Processes and accelerated inference via natural gradients. To validate our method, we empirically demonstrate its efficacy through experiments.">

Despite their widespread, second-order optimization algorithms exhibit superior convergence properties compared to their first-order counterparts e.g. Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs are still limited due to increased per-iteration computations and suboptimal accuracy compared to the first order methods. We present AdaFisher--an adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a block-diagonal approximation to the Fisher information matrix for adaptive gradient preconditioning. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between enhanced convergence capabilities and computational efficiency in second-order optimization framework for training DNNs. Despite the slow pace of second-order optimizers, we showcase that AdaFisher can be reliably adopted for image classification, language modelling and stand out for its stability and robustness in hyperparameter tuning.

        <tr id="There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.">

        <tr id="In this study, we develop a novel multi-fidelity deep learning approach that transforms low-fidelity solution maps into high-fidelity ones by incorporating parametric space information into a standard autoencoder architecture. This method's integration of parametric space information significantly reduces the need for training data to effectively predict high-fidelity solutions from low-fidelity ones. In this study, we examine a two-dimensional steady-state heat transfer analysis within a highly heterogeneous materials microstructure. The heat conductivity coefficients for two different materials are condensed from a 101 x 101 grid to smaller grids. We then solve the boundary value problem on the coarsest grid using a pre-trained physics-informed neural operator network known as Finite Operator Learning (FOL). The resulting low-fidelity solution is subsequently upscaled back to a 101 x 101 grid using a newly designed enhanced autoencoder. The novelty of the developed enhanced autoencoder lies in the concatenation of heat conductivity maps of different resolutions to the decoder segment in distinct steps. Hence the developed algorithm is named microstructure-embedded autoencoder (MEA). We compare the MEA outcomes with those from finite element methods, the standard U-Net, and various other upscaling techniques, including interpolation functions and feedforward neural networks (FFNN). Our analysis shows that MEA outperforms these methods in terms of computational efficiency and error on test cases. As a result, the MEA serves as a potential supplement to neural operator networks, effectively upscaling low-fidelity solutions to high fidelity while preserving critical details often lost in traditional upscaling methods, particularly at sharp interfaces like those seen with interpolation.">

        <tr id="High-dimensional data commonly lies on low-dimensional submanifolds, and estimating the local intrinsic dimension (LID) of a datum -- i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to -- is a longstanding problem. LID can be understood as the number of local factors of variation: the more factors of variation a datum has, the more complex it tends to be. Estimating this quantity has proven useful in contexts ranging from generalization in neural networks to detection of out-of-distribution data, adversarial examples, and AI-generated text. The recent successes of deep generative models present an opportunity to leverage them for LID estimation, but current methods based on generative models produce inaccurate estimates, require more than a single pre-trained model, are computationally intensive, or do not exploit the best available deep generative models, i.e. diffusion models (DMs). In this work, we show that the Fokker-Planck equation associated with a DM can provide a LID estimator which addresses all the aforementioned deficiencies. Our estimator, called FLIPD, is compatible with all popular DMs, and outperforms existing baselines on LID estimation benchmarks. We also apply FLIPD on natural images where the true LID is unknown. Compared to competing estimators, FLIPD exhibits a higher correlation with non-LID measures of complexity, better matches a qualitative assessment of complexity, and is the only estimator to remain tractable with high-resolution images at the scale of Stable Diffusion.">

The empirical distribution of the model weights converges to a deterministic measure governed by a McKean-Vlasov nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). Under L2 regularization, this PDE reduces to a closed set of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), reflecting the evolution of the model performance during the training process. We analyze the fixed point locations and their stability of the ODEs unveiling several interesting findings. First, only the hidden variable's second moment affects feature learnability at the state with uninformative initialization. Second, higher moments influence the probability of feature selection by controlling the attraction region, rather than affecting local stability. Finally, independent noises added in the data argumentation degrade performance but negatively correlated noise can reduces the variance of gradient estimation yielding better performance. Despite of the simplicity of the analyzed model, it exhibits a rich phenomena of training dynamics, paving a way to understand more complex mechanism behind practical large models.">

This article proposes a novel scheme for sampling from a distribution for which the probability density $\mu({\bf x})$ for ${\bf x}\in{\mathbb{R}}^d$ is unknown, but finite independent samples are given. We focus on constructing a Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) diffusion process on finite horizon $t\in[0,1]$ which induces a probability evolution starting from a fixed point at $t=0$ and ending with the desired target distribution $\mu({\bf x})$ at $t=1$. The diffusion process is characterized by a stochastic differential equation whose drift function can be solely estimated from data samples through a simple one-step procedure. Compared to the classical iterative schemes developed for the SB problem, the methodology of this article is quite simple, efficient, and computationally inexpensive as it does not require the training of neural network and thus circumvents many of the challenges in building the network architecture. The performance of our new generative model is evaluated through a series of numerical experiments on multi-modal low-dimensional simulated data and high-dimensional benchmark image data. Experimental results indicate that the synthetic samples generated from our SB Bridge based algorithm are comparable with the samples generated from the state-of-the-art methods in the field. Our formulation opens up new opportunities for developing efficient diffusion models that can be directly applied to large scale real-world data.">

This innovative approach involves the incorporation of physical constraints directly into the parameters of the neural network, coupled with the implementation of a global optimization strategy. We choose the AMOEBA+ force field as the physics-based model for embedding, and then train and test it using the diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) dataset as a case study. The results reveal a significant breakthrough in constructing a precise and noise-robust machine learning force field. Utilizing two training sets with hundreds of samples, our model exhibits remarkable generalization and DFT accuracy in describing molecular interactions and enables a precise prediction of the macroscopic properties such as diffusion coefficient with minimal cost.

These processes are highly nonlinear, stochastic, and sensitive to small perturbations of system parameters and initial conditions. Methods for the simulation of these processes have been developed using discrete numerical models, but these are computationally expensive. This work aims to scale crystal growth simulation with a machine learning emulator. Specifically, autoregressive latent variable models are well suited for modeling the joint distribution over system parameters and the crystallization trajectories. However, successfully training such models is challenging due to the stochasticity and sensitivity of the system. Existing approaches consequently fail to produce diverse and faithful crystallization trajectories. In this paper, we introduce the Crystal Growth Neural Emulator (CGNE), a probabilistic model for efficient crystal growth emulation at the mesoscopic scale that overcomes these challenges. We validate CGNE results using the morphological properties of the crystals produced by numerical simulation. CGNE delivers a factor of 11 improvement in inference time and performance gains compared with recent state-of-the-art probabilistic models for dynamical systems.">

In this work, we propose that a ML model, trained to predict the state one-step-ahead from several latest historic states, can accurately replicate the bifurcation diagram and the Lyapunov exponents of discrete dynamic systems. The characteristics for different values of the hyper-parameters are captured universally by a single ML model, while the previous works considered training the ML model independently by fixing the hyper-parameters to be specific values. Our benchmarks on the one- and two-dimensional Logistic maps show that variational quantum circuit can reproduce the long-term characteristics with higher accuracy than the long short-term memory (a well-recognized classical ML model). Our work reveals an essential difference between the ML for the chaotic characteristics and that for standard tasks, from the perspective of the relation between performance and model complexity. Our results suggest that quantum circuit model exhibits potential advantages on mitigating over-fitting, achieving higher accuracy and stability.">

We introduce a unifying strategy for learning mixtures of discrete and continuous-time Markov chains, focusing on hitting times, which are well defined for both types. Specifically, we design a reconstruction algorithm that outputs a mixture which accurately reflects the estimated hitting times and demonstrates resilience to noise. We introduce an efficient gradient-descent approach, specifically tailored to manage the computational complexity and non-symmetric characteristics inherent in the calculation of hitting time derivatives. Our approach is also of significant interest when applied to a single Markov chain, thus extending the methodologies previously established by Hoskins et al. and Wittmann et al.

        <tr id="De-interleaving of the mixtures of Hidden Markov Processes (HMPs) generally depends on its representation model. Existing representation models consider Markov chain mixtures rather than hidden Markov, resulting in the lack of robustness to non-ideal situations such as observation noise or missing observations. Besides, de-interleaving methods utilize a search-based strategy, which is time-consuming. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel representation model and corresponding de-interleaving methods for the mixtures of HMPs. At first, a generative model for representing the mixtures of HMPs is designed. Subsequently, the de-interleaving process is formulated as a posterior inference for the generative model. Secondly, an exact inference method is developed to maximize the likelihood of the complete data, and two approximate inference methods are developed to maximize the evidence lower bound by creating tractable structures. Then, a theoretical error probability lower bound is derived using the likelihood ratio test, and the algorithms are shown to get reasonably close to the bound. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods are highly effective and robust for non-ideal situations, outperforming baseline methods on simulated and real-life data.">

The success of state-of-the-art models stems from their ability to incorporate physical symmetries, such as translation, rotation, and periodicity. Here, we present a novel generative method called Response Matching (RM), which leverages the fact that each stable material or molecule exists at the minimum of its potential energy surface. Consequently, any perturbation induces a response in energy and stress, driving the structure back to equilibrium. Matching to such response is closely related to score matching in diffusion models. By employing the combination of a machine learning interatomic potential and random structure search as the denoising model, RM exploits the locality of atomic interactions, and inherently respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. RM is the first model to handle both molecules and bulk materials under the same framework. We demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of RM across three systems: a small organic molecular dataset, stable crystals from the Materials Project, and one-shot learning on a single diamond configuration.">

By augmenting the previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position, velocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data generation at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude. Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.">

We then compare these to gated recurrent models, and show that the latter exhibit more topological complexity, with a distinct pattern of changes common to all natural languages but absent from synthetically generated data.

To address this challenge, physics-informed training can offer a cost-effective strategy. However, current physics-informed neural operators face limitations, either in handling irregular domain shapes or in generalization to various discretizations of PDE parameters with variable mesh sizes. In this research, we introduce a novel physics-informed model architecture which can generalize to parameter discretizations of variable size and irregular domain shapes. Particularly, inspired by deep operator neural networks, our model involves a discretization-independent learning of parameter embedding repeatedly, and this parameter embedding is integrated with the response embeddings through multiple compositional layers, for more expressivity.

        <tr id="Scientists conduct large-scale simulations to compute derived quantities-of-interest (QoI) from primary data. Often, QoI are linked to specific features, regions, or time intervals, such that data can be adaptively reduced without compromising the integrity of QoI. For many spatiotemporal applications, these QoI are binary in nature and represent presence or absence of a physical phenomenon. We present a pipelined compression approach that first uses neural-network-based techniques to derive regions where QoI are highly likely to be present. Then, we employ a Guaranteed Autoencoder (GAE) to compress data with differential error bounds. GAE uses QoI information to apply low-error compression to only these regions. This results in overall high compression ratios while still achieving downstream goals of simulation or data collections. Experimental results are presented for climate data generated from the E3SM Simulation model for downstream quantities such as tropical cyclone and atmospheric river detection and tracking. These results show that our approach is superior to comparable methods in the literature.">

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamics of generic 3D scenes is fundamentally challenging in computer vision, essential in enhancing applications related to scene reconstruction, motion tracking, and avatar creation. In this work, we address the task as the problem of inferring dense, long-range motion of 3D points. By observing a set of point trajectories, we aim to learn an implicit motion field parameterized by a neural network to predict the movement of novel points within the same domain, without relying on any data-driven or scene-specific priors. To achieve this, our approach builds upon the recently introduced dynamic point field model that learns smooth deformation fields between the canonical frame and individual observation frames. However, temporal consistency between consecutive frames is neglected, and the number of required parameters increases linearly with the sequence length due to per-frame modeling. To address these shortcomings, we exploit the intrinsic regularization provided by SIREN, and modify the input layer to produce a spatiotemporally smooth motion field. Additionally, we analyze the motion field Jacobian matrix, and discover that the motion degrees of freedom (DOFs) in an infinitesimal area around a point and the network hidden variables have different behaviors to affect the model's representational power. This enables us to improve the model representation capability while retaining the model compactness. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of overfitting, we introduce a regularization term based on the assumption of piece-wise motion smoothness. Our experiments assess the model's performance in predicting unseen point trajectories and its application in temporal mesh alignment with guidance. The results demonstrate its superiority and effectiveness. The code and data for the project are publicly available: \url{https://yz-cnsdqz.github.io/eigenmotion/DOMA/}">

While the convergence behavior of Langevin Dynamics under unimodal distributions has been extensively studied in the literature, in practice the data distribution could consist of multiple distinct modes. In this work, we investigate Langevin Dynamics in producing samples from multimodal distributions and theoretically study its mode-seeking properties. We prove that under a variety of sub-Gaussian mixtures, Langevin Dynamics is unlikely to find all mixture components within a sub-exponential number of steps in the data dimension. To reduce the mode-seeking tendencies of Langevin Dynamics, we propose Chained Langevin Dynamics, which divides the data vector into patches of constant size and generates every patch sequentially conditioned on the previous patches. We perform a theoretical analysis of Chained Langevin Dynamics by reducing it to sampling from a constant-dimensional distribution. We present the results of several numerical experiments on synthetic and real image datasets, supporting our theoretical results on the iteration complexities of sample generation from mixture distributions using the chained and vanilla Langevin Dynamics.

While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Many machine learning and optimization algorithms are built upon the framework of stochastic approximation (SA), for which the selection of step-size (or learning rate) is essential for success. For the sake of clarity, this paper focuses on the special case $\alpha_n = \alpha_0 n^{-\rho}$ at iteration $n$, with $\rho \in [0,1]$ and $\alpha_0>0$ design parameters. It is most common in practice to take $\rho=0$ (constant step-size), while in more theoretically oriented papers a vanishing step-size is preferred. In particular, with $\rho \in (1/2, 1)$ it is known that on applying the averaging technique of Polyak and Ruppert, the mean-squared error (MSE) converges at the optimal rate of $O(1/n)$ and the covariance in the central limit theorem (CLT) is minimal in a precise sense. The paper revisits step-size selection in a general Markovian setting. Under readily verifiable assumptions, the following conclusions are obtained provided $0<\rho<1$: $\bullet$ Parameter estimates converge with probability one, and also in $L_p$ for any $p\ge 1$. $\bullet$ The MSE may converge very slowly for small $\rho$, of order $O(\alpha_n^2)$ even with averaging. $\bullet$ For linear stochastic approximation the source of slow convergence is identified: for any $\rho\in (0,1)$, averaging results in estimates for which the error $\textit{covariance}$ vanishes at the optimal rate, and moreover the CLT covariance is optimal in the sense of Polyak and Ruppert. However, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained under which the $\textit{bias}$ converges to zero at rate $O(\alpha_n)$. This is the first paper to obtain such strong conclusions while allowing for $\rho \le 1/2$. A major conclusion is that the choice of $\rho =0$ or even $\rho<1/2$ is justified only in select settings -- In general, bias may preclude fast convergence.">

Unlike previous approaches, most of which are algebraic in nature, our approach is analytic and relies on the framework of diffusion models. Diffusion models are a modern paradigm for generative modeling, which typically rely on learning the score function (gradient log-pdf) along a process transforming a pure noise distribution, in our case a Gaussian, to the data distribution. Despite their dazzling performance in tasks such as image generation, there are few end-to-end theoretical guarantees that they can efficiently learn nontrivial families of distributions; we give some of the first such guarantees. We proceed by deriving higher-order Gaussian noise sensitivity bounds for the score functions for a Gaussian mixture to show that that they can be inductively learned using piecewise polynomial regression (up to poly-logarithmic degree), and combine this with known convergence results for diffusion models. Our results extend to continuous mixtures of Gaussians where the mixing distribution is supported on a union of $k$ balls of constant radius. In particular, this applies to the case of Gaussian convolutions of distributions on low-dimensional manifolds, or more generally sets with small covering number.">

Chizat et al. arXiv:2205.07146 then provided a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the overwhelming success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce PO-MFL to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees by extending the results of arXiv:2102.09204 to the partially observed setting.

        <tr id="Data-driven, machine learning (ML) models of atomistic interactions are often based on flexible and non-physical functions that can relate nuanced aspects of atomic arrangements into predictions of energies and forces. As a result, these potentials are as good as the training data (usually results of so-called ab initio simulations) and we need to make sure that we have enough information for a model to become sufficiently accurate, reliable and transferable. The main challenge stems from the fact that descriptors of chemical environments are often sparse high-dimensional objects without a well-defined continuous metric. Therefore, it is rather unlikely that any ad hoc method of choosing training examples will be indiscriminate, and it will be easy to fall into the trap of confirmation bias, where the same narrow and biased sampling is used to generate train- and test- sets. We will demonstrate that classical concepts of statistical planning of experiments and optimal design can help to mitigate such problems at a relatively low computational cost. The key feature of the method we will investigate is that they allow us to assess the informativeness of data (how much we can improve the model by adding/swapping a training example) and verify if the training is feasible with the current set before obtaining any reference energies and forces -- a so-called off-line approach. In other words, we are focusing on an approach that is easy to implement and doesn't require sophisticated frameworks that involve automated access to high-performance computational (HPC).">

The basic dynamical mechanism is that inputs to the network generate ongoing activity, which in turn controls how additional inputs or signals propagate spatially or attenuate in time.

In such systems, patterns emerge from (local) interactions among self-propelled entities. While several well-understood governing equations for motion and interaction exist, they are difficult to fit to data due to the often large number of entities and missing correspondences between the observation times, which may also not be equidistant. To evade such confounding factors, we investigate collective behavior from a \textit{topological perspective}, but instead of summarizing entire observation sequences (as in prior work), we propose learning a latent dynamical model from topological features \textit{per time point}. The latter is then used to formulate a downstream regression task to predict the parametrization of some a priori specified governing equation. We implement this idea based on a latent ODE learned from vectorized (static) persistence diagrams and show that this modeling choice is justified by a combination of recent stability results for persistent homology. Various (ablation) experiments not only demonstrate the relevance of each individual model component, but provide compelling empirical evidence that our proposed model -- \textit{neural persistence dynamics} -- substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art across a diverse set of parameter regression tasks.">

This work studies a GGN method for optimizing a two-layer neural network with explicit regularization.

        <tr id="Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change. Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of ~40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations. These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections. Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on computationally expensive, short high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard. However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation. We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training. First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered. Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features. We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore, removing spurious non-physical relationships. This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of standard black-box DL-based parameterizations. Our framework represents a crucial step in addressing a major challenge in data-driven climate model parameterizations by respecting the underlying physical processes, and may also benefit physically consistent deep learning in other research fields.">

        <tr id="Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.">

In this paper, we study the problem of using meta-learning to deal with uncertainty and heterogeneity in ergodic linear quadratic regulators. We integrate the zeroth-order optimization technique with a typical meta-learning method, proposing an algorithm that omits the estimation of policy Hessian, which applies to tasks of learning a set of heterogeneous but similar linear dynamic systems. The induced meta-objective function inherits important properties of the original cost function when the set of linear dynamic systems are meta-learnable, allowing the algorithm to optimize over a learnable landscape without projection onto the feasible set. We provide a convergence result for the exact gradient descent process by analyzing the boundedness and smoothness of the gradient for the meta-objective, which justify the proposed algorithm with gradient estimation error being small. We also provide a numerical example to corroborate this perspective.">

        <tr id="Neural networks can identify low-dimensional relevant structures within high-dimensional noisy data, yet our mathematical understanding of how they do so remains scarce. Here, we investigate the training dynamics of two-layer shallow neural networks trained with gradient-based algorithms, and discuss how they learn pertinent features in multi-index models, that is target functions with low-dimensional relevant directions. In the high-dimensional regime, where the input dimension $d$ diverges, we show that a simple modification of the idealized single-pass gradient descent training scenario, where data can now be repeated or iterated upon twice, drastically improves its computational efficiency. In particular, it surpasses the limitations previously believed to be dictated by the Information and Leap exponents associated with the target function to be learned. Our results highlight the ability of networks to learn relevant structures from data alone without any pre-processing. More precisely, we show that (almost) all directions are learned with at most $O(d \log d)$ steps. Among the exceptions is a set of hard functions that includes sparse parities. In the presence of coupling between directions, however, these can be learned sequentially through a hierarchical mechanism that generalizes the notion of staircase functions. Our results are proven by a rigorous study of the evolution of the relevant statistics for high-dimensional dynamics.">

Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.">

In this paper, we draw a clear connection between the two and their key assumptions, allowing us to apply identifiable methods developed in causal representation learning to dynamical systems. At the same time, we can leverage scalable differentiable solvers developed for differential equations to build models that are both identifiable and practical. Overall, we learn explicitly controllable models that isolate the trajectory-specific parameters for further downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution classification or treatment effect estimation. We experiment with a wind simulator with partially known factors of variation. We also apply the resulting model to real-world climate data and successfully answer downstream causal questions in line with existing literature on climate change.">

However, they come with little theoretical guarantees and assessing their empirical performances is non-trivial. In such context, it is crucial to develop algorithms that are robust to the choice of hyperparameters and to gradients heterogeneity since, in practice, both the choice of step-size and behaviour of target gradients induce hard-to-control biases in the invariant distribution. In this work we introduce the stochastic gradient Barker dynamics (SGBD) algorithm, extending the recently developed Barker MCMC scheme, a robust alternative to Langevin-based sampling algorithms, to the stochastic gradient framework. We characterize the impact of stochastic gradients on the Barker transition mechanism and develop a bias-corrected version that, under suitable assumptions, eliminates the error due to the gradient noise in the proposal. We illustrate the performance on a number of high-dimensional examples, showing that SGBD is more robust to hyperparameter tuning and to irregular behavior of the target gradients compared to the popular stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics algorithm.">

        <tr id="A common obstruction to efficient sampling from high-dimensional distributions is the multimodality of the target distribution because Markov chains may get trapped far from stationarity. Still, one hopes that this is only a barrier to the mixing of Markov chains from worst-case initializations and can be overcome by choosing high-entropy initializations, e.g., a product or weakly correlated distribution. Ideally, from such initializations, the dynamics would escape from the saddle points separating modes quickly and spread its mass between the dominant modes. In this paper, we study convergence from high-entropy initializations for the random-cluster and Potts models on the complete graph -- two extensively studied high-dimensional landscapes that pose many complexities like discontinuous phase transitions and asymmetric metastable modes. We study the Chayes--Machta and Swendsen--Wang dynamics for the mean-field random-cluster model and the Glauber dynamics for the Potts model. We sharply characterize the set of product measure initializations from which these Markov chains mix rapidly, even though their mixing times from worst-case initializations are exponentially slow. Our proofs require careful approximations of projections of high-dimensional Markov chains (which are not themselves Markovian) by tractable 1-dimensional random processes, followed by analysis of the latter's escape from saddle points separating stable modes.">

Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), based on the Euler-Maruyama discretization, is the simplest and most studied algorithm. LMC can suffer from slow convergence - requiring a large number of steps of small step-size to obtain good quality samples. This becomes stark in the case of diffusion models where a large number of steps gives the best samples, but the quality degrades rapidly with smaller number of steps. Randomized Midpoint Method has been recently proposed as a better discretization of Langevin dynamics for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions. However, important applications such as diffusion models involve non-log concave densities and contain time varying drift. We propose its variant, the Poisson Midpoint Method, which approximates a small step-size LMC with large step-sizes. We prove that this can obtain a quadratic speed up of LMC under very weak assumptions. We apply our method to diffusion models for image generation and show that it maintains the quality of DDPM with 1000 neural network calls with just 50-80 neural network calls and outperforms ODE based methods with similar compute.">

The novelty of this approach is that it can control a system's dynamics despite the controller being much slower than the dynamics. We demonstrate this controller on the Lorenz system of equations where it iteratively adjusts (tunes) the system's input parameters to successfully reproduce a desired oscillatory trajectory or state. Additionally, we investigate the system's dynamical sensitivity to its control parameters, identify continuous and bounded regions of desired dynamical trajectories, and demonstrate that the controller is robust to missing information and uncontrollable parameters as long as certain requirements are met.

Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds.

Yet, to-date it has remained unclear how to actually exploit modern reinforcement learning technologies for adaptive MCMC. The aim of this paper is to set out a general framework, called Reinforcement Learning Metropolis--Hastings, that is theoretically supported and empirically validated. Our principal focus is on learning fast-mixing Metropolis--Hastings transition kernels, which we cast as deterministic policies and optimise via a policy gradient. Control of the learning rate provably ensures conditions for ergodicity are satisfied. The methodology is used to construct a gradient-free sampler that out-performs a popular gradient-free adaptive Metropolis--Hastings algorithm on $\approx 90 \%$ of tasks in the PosteriorDB benchmark.">

Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, for all time steps within the stability criteria correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new accompanying velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions.

We then investigate in detail two adaptive learning rates -- an idealized exact line search and AdaGrad-Norm -- on the least squares problem. When the data covariance matrix has strictly positive eigenvalues, this idealized exact line search strategy can exhibit arbitrarily slower convergence when compared to the optimal fixed learning rate with SGD. Moreover we exactly characterize the limiting learning rate (as time goes to infinity) for line search in the setting where the data covariance has only two distinct eigenvalues. For noiseless targets, we further demonstrate that the AdaGrad-Norm learning rate converges to a deterministic constant inversely proportional to the average eigenvalue of the data covariance matrix, and identify a phase transition when the covariance density of eigenvalues follows a power law distribution.">

        <tr id="The finite parts of a large, locally interacting many-body system prepared out-of-equilibrium eventually equilibrate. Characterising the underlying mechanisms of this process and its timescales, however, is particularly hard as it requires to decouple universal features from observable-specific ones. Recently, new insight came by studying how certain symmetries of the dynamics that are broken by the initial state are restored at the level of the reduced state of a given subsystem. This provides a high level, observable-independent probe. Until now this idea has been applied to the restoration of internal symmetries, e.g. U(1) symmetries related to charge conservation. Here we show that that the same logic can be applied to the restoration of space-time symmetries, and hence can be used to characterise the relaxation of fully generic systems. We illustrate this idea by considering the paradigmatic example of"generic"many-body dynamics, i.e. a local random unitary circuit. We show that, surprisingly, the restoration of translation symmetry in these systems only happens on time-scales proportional to the subsystem's volume. In fact, for large enough subsystems the time of symmetry restoration becomes initial-state independent (as long as the latter breaks the symmetry at time zero) and coincides with the thermalisation time. For intermediate subsystems, however, one can observe the so-called"quantum Mpemba effect", where the state of the system restores a symmetry faster if it is initially more asymmetric.">

        <tr id="Hidden Markov Model (HMM) inference for time-series data from ion channels or other biomolecules is challenging. We argue that inference on partially observed chemical reaction networks (CRNs) suffers from practical parameter non-identifiability (non-PI) that often goes unnoticed in maximum likelihood (ML) inferences. Limitations in the signal bandwidth and a poor signal-to-noise ratio only add to the non-PI problem. We study the role of the prior distribution in the face of non-PI. In particular, we advocate using minimally informative (MI) priors and additional restrictions on the parameter space that can be derived from physical considerations. Using patch clamp (PC) ion-channel measurements as a prototypical time series, we demonstrate Bayesian strategies for alleviating non-PI problems with sharpened prior information. In Bayesian statistics, the prior can substantially modulate the posterior. We demonstrate that non-PI can be severely harmful when using uniform priors on the rate matrix of HMMs, which are implicitly assumed in ML. We show that MI priors enable meaningful HMM inference with data whose quality can be one to two orders of magnitude worse than required to reach the same accuracy with uniform priors. However, we also demonstrate that non-PI pathologies can persist even with a prior MI. In this case, the MI prior alleviates but does not entirely resolve the problem of improper posteriors. For complex HMMs, stronger prior assumptions are needed to render the posterior proper. We propose to confine the parameters to a sampling box whose limits are physically reasonable and derived from theory. This fusion of data and physical information allows for meaningful inferences even for the most complex HMM with data of the lowest quality that we tested. However, hard theoretical limits, such as diffusion-limited binding rates, are rarely available. As an alternative, we test a vague prior on the ratios of each pair of binding rates and additionally unbinding rates, thereby softly linking them. This implicitly assumes finite cooperativity and introduces a bias towards non-cooperativity. However, in contrast to the standard practice of choosing equal chemical rates, which supposes strict non-cooperativity, this additional prior still allows for cooperativity. Despite its vagueness, our prior renders the posterior either proper in a strict sense or sufficiently proper for all data sets we considered without imposing the assumption of non-cooperativity. Hence, our approach can infer how likely different degrees of cooperativity are. Combining theoretical upper limits and vague finite cooperativity assumptions dramatically improves inferences.">

Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with an exponent of approximately -0.5, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.">

They involve physics beyond the reach of equilibrium statistical mechanics, and a persistent challenge has been to understand the nature of their nonequilibrium states. The entropy production rate and the probability current provide quantitative ways to do so by measuring the breakdown of time-reversal symmetry. Yet, their efficient computation has remained elusive, as they depend on the system's unknown and high-dimensional probability density. Here, building upon recent advances in generative modeling, we develop a deep learning framework to estimate the score of this density. We show that the score, together with the microscopic equations of motion, gives access to the entropy production rate, the probability current, and their decomposition into local contributions from individual particles. To represent the score, we introduce a spatially local transformer network architecture that learns high-order interactions between particles while respecting their underlying permutation symmetry. We demonstrate the broad utility and scalability of the method by applying it to several high-dimensional systems of active particles undergoing motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). We show that a single network trained on a system of 4,096 particles at one packing fraction can generalize to other regions of the phase diagram, including to systems with as many as 32,768 particles. We use this observation to quantify the spatial structure of the departure from equilibrium in MIPS as a function of the number of particles and the packing fraction.">

While computing the mean of pairwise distances between any two distributions is a prevalent method to quantify the total divergence among multiple distributions, it is imperative to acknowledge that this approach is not straightforward and necessitates significant computational resources. In this study, we introduce a new divergence measure tailored for multiple distributions named the generalized Cauchy-Schwarz divergence (GCSD). Additionally, we furnish a kernel-based closed-form sample estimator, making it convenient and straightforward to use in various machine-learning applications. Finally, we explore its profound implications in the realm of deep learning by applying it to tackle two thoughtfully chosen machine-learning tasks: deep clustering and multi-source domain adaptation. Our extensive experimental investigations confirm the robustness and effectiveness of GCSD in both scenarios. The findings also underscore the innovative potential of GCSD and its capability to significantly propel machine learning methodologies that necessitate the quantification of multiple distributions.">

However, the accuracy of a ML trained model is limited by the quality and quantity of the training data. Generating large sets of accurate ab initio training data can require significant computational resources. Furthermore, inconsistent or incompatible data with different accuracies obtained using different methods may lead to biased or unreliable ML models that do not accurately represent the underlying physics. Recently, transfer learning showed its potential for avoiding these problems as well as for improving the accuracy, efficiency, and generalization of ML models using multifidelity data. In this work, ab initio trained ML-based MD (aML-MD) models are developed through transfer learning using DFT and multireference data from multiple sources with varying accuracy within the Deep Potential MD framework. The accuracy of the force field is demonstrated by calculating rate constants for the H + HO2 → H2 + 3O2 reaction using quasi-classical trajectories. We show that the aML-MD model with transfer learning can accurately predict the rate constants while reducing the computational cost by more than five times compared to the use of more expensive quantum chemistry training data sets. Hence, the aML-MD model with transfer learning shows great potential in using multifidelity data to reduce the computational cost involved in generating the training set for these potentials.">

Sparse models are capable of maintaining the high accuracy of state of the art models, while functioning at the cost of more parsimonious models. The structures which underlie sparse architectures are, however, poorly understood and not consistent between differently trained models and sparsification schemes. In this paper, we propose a new technique for sparsification of recurrent neural nets (RNNs), called moduli regularization, in combination with magnitude pruning. Moduli regularization leverages the dynamical system induced by the recurrent structure to induce a geometric relationship between neurons in the hidden state of the RNN. By making our regularizing term explicitly geometric, we provide the first, to our knowledge, a priori description of the desired sparse architecture of our neural net. We verify the effectiveness of our scheme for navigation and natural language processing RNNs. Navigation is a structurally geometric task, for which there are known moduli spaces, and we show that regularization can be used to reach 90% sparsity while maintaining model performance only when coefficients are chosen in accordance with a suitable moduli space. Natural language processing, however, has no known moduli space in which computations are performed. Nevertheless, we show that moduli regularization induces more stable recurrent neural nets with a variety of moduli regularizers, and achieves high fidelity models at 98% sparsity.">

        <tr id="Stochastic gradients have been widely integrated into Langevin-based methods to improve their scalability and efficiency in solving large-scale sampling problems. However, the proximal sampler, which exhibits much faster convergence than Langevin-based algorithms in the deterministic setting Lee et al. (2021), has yet to be explored in its stochastic variants. In this paper, we study the Stochastic Proximal Samplers (SPS) for sampling from non-log-concave distributions. We first establish a general framework for implementing stochastic proximal samplers and establish the convergence theory accordingly. We show that the convergence to the target distribution can be guaranteed as long as the second moment of the algorithm trajectory is bounded and restricted Gaussian oracles can be well approximated. We then provide two implementable variants based on Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), giving rise to SPS-SGLD and SPS-MALA. We further show that SPS-SGLD and SPS-MALA can achieve $\epsilon$-sampling error in total variation (TV) distance within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1/2}\epsilon^{-2})$ gradient complexities, which outperform the best-known result by at least an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1/3})$ factor. This enhancement in performance is corroborated by our empirical studies on synthetic data with various dimensions, demonstrating the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.">

        <tr id="A problem in nonlinear and complex dynamical systems with broad applications is forecasting the occurrence of a critical transition based solely on data without knowledge about the system equations. When such a transition leads to system collapse, as often is the case, all the available data are from the pre-critical regime where the system still functions normally, making the prediction problem challenging. In recent years, a machine-learning based approach tailored to solving this difficult prediction problem, adaptable reservoir computing, has been articulated. This Perspective introduces the basics of this machine-learning scheme and describes representative results. The general setting is that the system dynamics live on a normal attractor with oscillatory dynamics at the present time and, as a bifurcation parameter changes into the future, a critical transition can occur after which the system switches to a completely different attractor, signifying system collapse. To predict a critical transition, it is essential that the reservoir computer not only learns the dynamical "climate" of the system of interest at some specific parameter value but, more importantly, discovers how the system dynamics changes with the bifurcation parameter. It is demonstrated that this capability can be endowed into the machine through a training process with time series from a small number of distinct, pre-critical parameter values, thereby enabling accurate and reliable prediction of the catastrophic critical transition. Three applications are presented: predicting crisis, forecasting amplitude death, and creating digital twins of nonlinear dynamical systems. Limitations and future perspectives are discussed.">

These include the remarkable generalization capabilities of overparametrized neural networks (NNs), the efficient optimization performance despite non-convexity of objectives, the mechanism of flat minima for generalization, and the exceptional performance of deep architectures in solving physical problems. This paper introduces General Distribution Learning (GD Learning), a novel theoretical learning framework designed to address a comprehensive range of machine learning and statistical tasks, including classification, regression and parameter estimation. Departing from traditional statistical machine learning, GD Learning focuses on the true underlying distribution. In GD Learning, learning error, corresponding to the expected error in classical statistical learning framework, is divided into fitting errors due to models and algorithms, as well as sampling errors introduced by limited sampling data. The framework significantly incorporates prior knowledge, especially in scenarios characterized by data scarcity, thereby enhancing performance. Within the GD Learning framework, we demonstrate that the global optimal solutions in non-convex optimization can be approached by minimizing the gradient norm and the non-uniformity of the eigenvalues of the model's Jacobian matrix. This insight leads to the development of the gradient structure control algorithm. GD Learning also offers fresh insights into the questions on deep learning, including overparameterization and non-convex optimization, bias-variance trade-off, and the mechanism of flat minima.">

However, they often fail to achieve the same level of accuracy as classical methods in solving differential equations. In this paper, we identify two sources of this issue in the case of Cauchy problems: the use of $L^2$ residuals as objective functions and the approximation gap of neural networks. We show that minimizing the sum of $L^2$ residual and initial condition error is not sufficient to guarantee the true solution, as this loss function does not capture the underlying dynamics. Additionally, neural networks are not capable of capturing singularities in the solutions due to the non-compactness of their image sets. This, in turn, influences the existence of global minima and the regularity of the network. We demonstrate that when the global minimum does not exist, machine precision becomes the predominant source of achievable error in practice. We also present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.">

        <tr id="Online prediction of time series under regime switching is a widely studied problem in the literature, with many celebrated approaches. Using the non-parametric flexibility of Gaussian processes, the recently proposed INTEL algorithm provides a product of experts approach to online prediction of time series under possible regime switching, including the special case of outliers. This is achieved by adaptively combining several candidate models, each reporting their predictive distribution at time $t$. However, the INTEL algorithm uses a finite context window approximation to the predictive distribution, the computation of which scales cubically with the maximum lag, or otherwise scales quartically with exact predictive distributions. We introduce LINTEL, which uses the exact filtering distribution at time $t$ with constant-time updates, making the time complexity of the streaming algorithm optimal. We additionally note that the weighting mechanism of INTEL is better suited to a mixture of experts approach, and propose a fusion policy based on arithmetic averaging for LINTEL. We show experimentally that our proposed approach is over five times faster than INTEL under reasonable settings with better quality predictions.">

They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learn- ing models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irreg- ular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based mod- els, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experi- ments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.">

Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

It extracts latent vectors from atomic coordinates of MD simulations using graph convolutional network (GCN), utilizes LSTM to learn temporal trends in latent vectors and make one-step-ahead predictions of physical properties through fully connected layers. Validating with MD simulations of Ni solid-liquid systems, the model achieved accurate one-step-ahead prediction for time variation of the potential energy during solidification and melting processes using residual connections. Recursive use of predicted values enabled long-term prediction from just the first 20 snapshots of the MD simulation. The prediction has captured the feature of potential energy bending at low temperatures, which represents completion of solidification, despite that the MD data in short time do not have such a bending characteristic. Remarkably, for long-time prediction over 900 ps, the computation time was reduced to 1/700th of a full MD simulation of the same duration. This approach has shown the potential to significantly reduce computational cost for prediction of physical properties by efficiently utilizing the data of MD simulation. .">

We introduce a three-level hierarchy of marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, and identify that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations. We then propose to amortise computations by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, providing a $\textit{warm start}$. Finally, we discuss the necessary conditions and quantify the consequences of warm starts and demonstrate their effectiveness on regression tasks, where warm starts achieve the same results as the conventional procedure while providing up to a $16 \times$ average speed-up among datasets.">

It allows the study of many systems showing states with large-scale correlations and their classification in a relatively small set of universality classes. RG is the most powerful tool for investigating organizational scales within dynamic systems. However, the application of RG techniques to complex networks has presented significant challenges, primarily due to the intricate interplay of correlations on multiple scales. Existing approaches have relied on hypotheses involving hidden geometries and based on embedding complex networks into hidden metric spaces. Here, we present a practical overview of the recently introduced Laplacian Renormalization Group for heterogeneous networks. First, we present a brief overview that justifies the use of the Laplacian as a natural extension for well-known field theories to analyze spatial disorder. We then draw an analogy to traditional real-space renormalization group procedures, explaining how the LRG generalizes the concept of"Kadanoff supernodes"as block nodes that span multiple scales. These supernodes help mitigate the effects of cross-scale correlations due to small-world properties. Additionally, we rigorously define the LRG procedure in momentum space in the spirit of Wilson RG. Finally, we show different analyses for the evolution of network properties along the LRG flow following structural changes when the network is properly reduced.">

        <tr id="Transport phenomena (e.g., fluid flows) are governed by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) describing mass, momentum, and energy conservation, and are ubiquitous in many engineering applications. However, deep learning architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the simulation of these PDEs. This paper clearly articulates and then solves this incompatibility. The local-dependency of generic transport PDEs implies that it only involves local information to predict the physical properties at a location in the next time step. However, the deep learning architecture will inevitably increase the scope of information to make such predictions as the number of layers increases, which can cause sluggish convergence and compromise generalizability. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a distributed data scoping method with linear time complexity to strictly limit the scope of information to predict the local properties. The numerical experiments over multiple physics show that our data scoping method significantly accelerates training convergence and improves the generalizability of benchmark models on large-scale engineering simulations. Specifically, over the geometries not included in the training data for heat transferring simulation, it can increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 21.7 \% and that of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by 38.5 \% on average.">

Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

In this paper, we study the sharpness of deep linear networks for overdetermined univariate regression. Minimizers can have arbitrarily large sharpness, but not an arbitrarily small one. Indeed, we show a lower bound on the sharpness of minimizers, which grows linearly with depth. We then study the properties of the minimizer found by gradient flow, which is the limit of gradient descent with vanishing learning rate. We show an implicit regularization towards flat minima: the sharpness of the minimizer is no more than a constant times the lower bound. The constant depends on the condition number of the data covariance matrix, but not on width or depth. This result is proven both for a small-scale initialization and a residual initialization. Results of independent interest are shown in both cases. For small-scale initialization, we show that the learned weight matrices are approximately rank-one and that their singular vectors align. For residual initialization, convergence of the gradient flow for a Gaussian initialization of the residual network is proven. Numerical experiments illustrate our results and connect them to gradient descent with non-vanishing learning rate.">

        <tr id="The dynamics of biological systems, from proteins to cells to organisms, is complex and stochastic. To decipher their physical laws, we need to bridge between experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Thanks to progress in microscopy and tracking, there is today an abundance of experimental trajectories reflecting these dynamical laws. Inferring physical models from noisy and imperfect experimental data, however, is challenging. Because there are no inference methods that are robust and efficient, model reconstruction from experimental trajectories is a bottleneck to data-driven biophysics. In this Thesis, I present a set of tools developed to bridge this gap and permit robust and universal inference of stochastic dynamical models from experimental trajectories. These methods are rooted in an information-theoretical framework that quantifies how much can be inferred from trajectories that are short, partial and noisy. They permit the efficient inference of dynamical models for overdamped and underdamped Langevin systems, as well as the inference of entropy production rates. I finally present early applications of these techniques, as well as future research directions.">

Many studies tried to combine the measurement into diffusion by score function replacement, matrix decomposition, or optimization algorithms, but it is hard to balance the data consistency and realness. The slow sampling speed is also a main obstacle to its wide application. To address the challenges, we propose Deep Data Consistency (DDC) to update the data consistency step with a deep learning model when solving inverse problems with diffusion models. By analyzing existing methods, the variational bound training objective is used to maximize the conditional posterior and reduce its impact on the diffusion process. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods in linear and non-linear tasks, DDC demonstrates its outstanding performance of both similarity and realness metrics in generating high-quality solutions with only 5 inference steps in 0.77 seconds on average. In addition, the robustness of DDC is well illustrated in the experiments across datasets, with large noise and the capacity to solve multiple tasks in only one pre-trained model.">

        <tr id="Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs and susceptibility to local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

Recently, local structural variables identified using machine learning, such as"softness", have emerged as predictors of local dynamics. Here we construct a model using softness to describe the structural origins of dynamical heterogeneity in supercooled liquids. In our model, the probability of particles to rearrange is determined by their softness, and each rearrangement induces changes in the softness of nearby particles, describing facilitation. We show how to ensure that these changes respect the underlying time-reversal symmetry of the liquid's dynamics. The model reproduces the salient features of dynamical heterogeneity, and demonstrates how long-ranged dynamical correlations can emerge at long time scales from a relatively short softness correlation length.">

Integral to the efficacy of UDEs is the joint estimation of parameters within mechanistic formulations and the universal function approximators using empirical data.

With this work, we provide a formalisation of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for UDEs and investigate important frequentist and Bayesian methods.

To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and six non-hybrid systems show that our method outperforms previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.">

Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.">

At any discrete time instant, each observed variable of the multivariate process is a binary string of random length, which is parameterized by an unobservable or hidden [0,1]-valued scalar. The hidden scalars corresponding to the variables evolve according to discrete-time linear stochastic dynamics dictated by the underlying influence graph whose nodes are the variables. We extend an existing algorithm for learning i.i.d. graphical models to this Markovian setting with memory and prove that it can learn the influence graph based on the binary observations using logarithmic (in number of variables or nodes) samples when the degree of the influence graph is bounded. The crucial analytical contribution of this work is the derivation of the sample complexity result by upper and lower bounding the rate of convergence of the observed Markov process with memory to its stationary distribution in terms of the parameters of the influence graph.">

        <tr id="State Space Model (SSM) is a mathematical model used to describe and analyze the behavior of dynamic systems. This model has witnessed numerous applications in several fields, including control theory, signal processing, economics and machine learning. In the field of deep learning, state space models are used to process sequence data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and video understanding. By mapping sequence data to state space, long-term dependencies in the data can be better captured. In particular, modern SSMs have shown strong representational capabilities in NLP, especially in long sequence modeling, while maintaining linear time complexity. Notably, based on the latest state-space models, Mamba merges time-varying parameters into SSMs and formulates a hardware-aware algorithm for efficient training and inference. Given its impressive efficiency and strong long-range dependency modeling capability, Mamba is expected to become a new AI architecture that may outperform Transformer. Recently, a number of works have attempted to study the potential of Mamba in various fields, such as general vision, multi-modal, medical image analysis and remote sensing image analysis, by extending Mamba from natural language domain to visual domain. To fully understand Mamba in the visual domain, we conduct a comprehensive survey and present a taxonomy study. This survey focuses on Mamba's application to a variety of visual tasks and data types, and discusses its predecessors, recent advances and far-reaching impact on a wide range of domains. Since Mamba is now on an upward trend, please actively notice us if you have new findings, and new progress on Mamba will be included in this survey in a timely manner and updated on the Mamba project at https://github.com/lx6c78/Vision-Mamba-A-Comprehensive-Survey-and-Taxonomy.">

The second use case concerns reverse stress testing, which is formulated as an inversion function problem and is treated here via an optimal transport technique in combination with the notions of kernel-based encoders, decoders, and generators. Third, we show that standard techniques for time series analysis can be enhanced by using the proposed generative algorithms.

As a result, these algorithms may search an unnecessarily large space and discover equations that are less accurate or overly complex.

Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming.

        <tr id="Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order gradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can greatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order optimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the gradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks is matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak scalability. Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations. Given that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a $\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with exponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs demonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\cdot\kappa \log(N\cdot\kappa/\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition number~$\kappa$, error tolerance~$\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of the matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential advantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\kappa$ and $d$). We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating neural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined scheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear solvers, by estimating&reducing $\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum solver. Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce the total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We hypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is reduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes an ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing.">

We describe the scenarios for the emergence of complex collective behavior, including chaotic oscillations and multistability. We also compare the dynamics of the neural mass model and the exact microscopic system and show that their agreement may be far from perfect. The discrepancy can be interpreted as the action of the so-called shot noise originating from finite-size effects. This shot noise can lead to the blurring of the neural mass dynamics or even turn its attractors into metastable states between which the system switches recurrently.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators in vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in downstream tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper studies amortized sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free learning objective, relative trajectory balance, for training a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning.">

        <tr id="The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective technique to produce interpretable models of dynamical systems from time-resolved state data via sparse regression. However, to model parameterized systems, SINDy requires data from transient trajectories for various parameter values over the range of interest, which are typically difficult to acquire experimentally. In this work, we extend SINDy to be able to leverage data on fixed points and/or limit cycles to reduce the number of transient trajectories needed for successful system identification. To achieve this, we incorporate the data on these attractors at various parameter values as constraints in the optimization problem. First, we show that enforcing these as hard constraints leads to an ill-conditioned regression problem due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we implement soft constraints by modifying the cost function to be minimized. This leads to the formulation of a multi-objective sparse regression problem where we simultaneously seek to minimize the error of the fit to the transients trajectories and to the data on attractors, while penalizing the number of terms in the model. Our extension, demonstrated on several numerical examples, is more robust to noisy measurements and requires substantially less training data than the original SINDy method to correctly identify a parameterized dynamical system.">

Based on the low-rank TT representation, the tensor algebraic system is then approximated as a TT-based low-rank system, which is efficiently solved using the TT-modified alternating least-squares (TT-MALS) solver. Thanks to the low-rank TT representation, the APTT method can significantly reduce the computational and memory costs compared to traditional numerical methods. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the APTT method maintains the same convergence rate as that of the finite difference scheme. The convergence rate and efficiency of the APTT method are validated by several benchmark test cases.">

To address this, we show how the distributed approach offered by vector symbolic architectures (VSAs), which uses high-dimensional random vectors as the smallest units of representation, can be leveraged to embed robust multi-timescale dynamics into attractor-based RSNNs. We embed finite state machines into the RSNN dynamics by superimposing a symmetric autoassociative weight matrix and asymmetric transition terms. The transition terms are formed by the VSA binding of an input and heteroassociative outer-products between states. Our approach is validated through simulations with highly non-ideal weights; an experimental closed-loop memristive hardware setup; and on Loihi 2, where it scales seamlessly to large state machines. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of VSA representations for embedding robust computation with recurrent dynamics into neuromorphic hardware, without requiring parameter fine-tuning or significant platform-specific optimisation. This advances VSAs as a high-level representation-invariant abstract language for cognitive algorithms in neuromorphic hardware.">

Unlike previous approaches, we do not employ the integral relation imposed by unitarity, but instead train FNOs to discover it from many samples of amplitudes with finite partial wave expansions. When trained only on true samples, the FNO correctly predicts (unique or ambiguous) phases of amplitudes with infinite partial wave expansions. When also trained on false samples, it can rate the quality of its prediction by producing a true/false classifying index. We observe that the value of this index is strongly correlated with the violation of the unitarity constraint for the predicted phase, and present examples where it delineates the boundary between allowed and disallowed profiles of the modulus. Our application of FNOs is unconventional: it involves a simultaneous regression-classification task and emphasizes the role of statistics in ensembles of NOs.

        <tr id="Neural networks are lately more and more often being used in the context of data-driven control, as an approximate model of the true system dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) adopts this practise leading to neural MPC strategies. This raises a question of whether the trained neural network has converged and generalized in a way that the learned model encapsulates an accurate approximation of the true dynamic model of the system, thus making it a reliable choice for model-based control, especially for disturbed and uncertain systems. To tackle that, we propose Dropout MPC, a novel sampling-based ensemble neural MPC algorithm that employs the Monte-Carlo dropout technique on the learned system model. The closed loop is based on an ensemble of predictive controllers, that are used simultaneously at each time-step for trajectory optimization. Each member of the ensemble influences the control input, based on a weighted voting scheme, thus by employing different realizations of the learned system dynamics, neural control becomes more reliable by design. An additional strength of the method is that it offers by design a way to estimate future uncertainty, leading to cautious control. While the method aims in general at uncertain systems with complex dynamics, where models derived from first principles are hard to infer, to showcase the application we utilize data gathered in the laboratory from a real mobile manipulator and employ the proposed algorithm for the navigation of the robot in simulation.">

        <tr id="A key property of neural networks driving their success is their ability to learn features from data. Understanding feature learning from a theoretical viewpoint is an emerging field with many open questions. In this work we capture finite-width effects with a systematic theory of network kernels in deep non-linear neural networks. We show that the Bayesian prior of the network can be written in closed form as a superposition of Gaussian processes, whose kernels are distributed with a variance that depends inversely on the network width N . A large deviation approach, which is exact in the proportional limit for the number of data points $P = \alpha N \rightarrow \infty$, yields a pair of forward-backward equations for the maximum a posteriori kernels in all layers at once. We study their solutions perturbatively to demonstrate how the backward propagation across layers aligns kernels with the target. An alternative field-theoretic formulation shows that kernel adaptation of the Bayesian posterior at finite-width results from fluctuations in the prior: larger fluctuations correspond to a more flexible network prior and thus enable stronger adaptation to data. We thus find a bridge between the classical edge-of-chaos NNGP theory and feature learning, exposing an intricate interplay between criticality, response functions, and feature scale.">

        <tr id="Reservoir computing is a machine learning framework that exploits nonlinear dynamics, exhibiting significant computational capabilities. One of the defining characteristics of reservoir computing is its low cost and straightforward training algorithm, i.e. only the readout, given by a linear combination of reservoir variables, is trained. Inspired by recent mathematical studies based on dynamical system theory, in particular generalized synchronization, we propose a novel reservoir computing framework with generalized readout, including a nonlinear combination of reservoir variables. The first crucial advantage of using the generalized readout is its mathematical basis for improving information processing capabilities. Secondly, it is still within a linear learning framework, which preserves the original strength of reservoir computing. In summary, the generalized readout is naturally derived from mathematical theory and allows the extraction of useful basis functions from reservoir dynamics without sacrificing simplicity. In a numerical study, we find that introducing the generalized readout leads to a significant improvement in accuracy and an unexpected enhancement in robustness for the short- and long-term prediction of Lorenz chaos, with a particular focus on how to harness low-dimensional reservoir dynamics. A novel way and its advantages for physical implementations of reservoir computing with generalized readout are briefly discussed.">

        <tr id="As one kind important phase field equations, Cahn-Hilliard equations contain spatial high order derivatives, strong nonlinearities, and even singularities. When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.">

        <tr id="We propose a deep learning algorithm for high dimensional optimal stopping problems. Our method is inspired by the penalty method for solving free boundary PDEs. Within our approach, the penalized PDE is approximated using the Deep BSDE framework proposed by \cite{weinan2017deep}, which leads us to coin the term"Deep Penalty Method (DPM)"to refer to our algorithm. We show that the error of the DPM can be bounded by the loss function and $O(\frac{1}{\lambda})+O(\lambda h) +O(\sqrt{h})$, where $h$ is the step size in time and $\lambda$ is the penalty parameter. This finding emphasizes the need for careful consideration when selecting the penalization parameter and suggests that the discretization error converges at a rate of order $\frac{1}{2}$. We validate the efficacy of the DPM through numerical tests conducted on a high-dimensional optimal stopping model in the area of American option pricing. The numerical tests confirm both the accuracy and the computational efficiency of our proposed algorithm.">

        <tr id="Tuning scientific and probabilistic machine learning models -- for example, partial differential equations, Gaussian processes, or Bayesian neural networks -- often relies on evaluating functions of matrices whose size grows with the data set or the number of parameters. While the state-of-the-art for evaluating these quantities is almost always based on Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, the present work is the first to explain how to differentiate these workhorses of numerical linear algebra efficiently. To get there, we derive previously unknown adjoint systems for Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, implement them in JAX, and show that the resulting code can compete with Diffrax when it comes to differentiating PDEs, GPyTorch for selecting Gaussian process models and beats standard factorisation methods for calibrating Bayesian neural networks. All this is achieved without any problem-specific code optimisation. Find the code at https://github.com/pnkraemer/experiments-lanczos-adjoints and install the library with pip install matfree.">

        <tr id="We propose the idea of using Kuramoto models (including their higher-dimensional generalizations) for machine learning over non-Euclidean data sets. These models are systems of matrix ODE's describing collective motions (swarming dynamics) of abstract particles (generalized oscillators) on spheres, homogeneous spaces and Lie groups. Such models have been extensively studied from the beginning of XXI century both in statistical physics and control theory. They provide a suitable framework for encoding maps between various manifolds and are capable of learning over spherical and hyperbolic geometries. In addition, they can learn coupled actions of transformation groups (such as special orthogonal, unitary and Lorentz groups). Furthermore, we overview families of probability distributions that provide appropriate statistical models for probabilistic modeling and inference in Geometric Deep Learning. We argue in favor of using statistical models which arise in different Kuramoto models in the continuum limit of particles. The most convenient families of probability distributions are those which are invariant with respect to actions of certain symmetry groups.">

        <tr id="The stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model considered here is a two-dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential equation with additive degenerate noise, whose first component, the only one observed, describes the membrane voltage evolution of a single neuron. Due to its low dimensionality, its analytical and numerical tractability, and its neuronal interpretation, it has been used as a case study to test the performance of different statistical methods in estimating the underlying model parameters. Existing methods, however, often require complete observations, non-degeneracy of the noise or a complex architecture (e.g., to estimate the transition density of the process,"recovering"the unobserved second component), and they may not (satisfactorily) estimate all model parameters simultaneously. Moreover, these studies lack real data applications for the stochastic FHN model. Here, we tackle all challenges (non-globally Lipschitz drift, non-explicit solution, lack of available transition density, degeneracy of the noise, and partial observations) via an intuitive and easy-to-implement sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm. The proposed method relies on a recent computationally efficient and structure-preserving numerical splitting scheme for synthetic data generation, and on summary statistics exploiting the structural properties of the process. We succeed in estimating all model parameters from simulated data and, more remarkably, real action potential data of rats. The presented novel real-data fit may broaden the scope and credibility of this classic and widely used neuronal model.">

In this work, we present Verlet flows, a class of CNFs on an augmented state-space inspired by symplectic integrators from Hamiltonian dynamics. When used with carefully constructed Taylor-Verlet integrators, Verlet flows provide exact-likelihood generative models which generalize coupled flow architectures from a non-continuous setting while imposing minimal expressivity constraints. On experiments over toy densities, we demonstrate that the variance of the commonly used Hutchinson trace estimator is unsuitable for importance sampling, whereas Verlet flows perform comparably to full autograd trace computations while being significantly faster.">
