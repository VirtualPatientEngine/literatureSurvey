        <tr id="We develop an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for the automated discovery and identification of traveling waves in spatiotemporal systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our method uses sparse regression and subspace clustering to robustly identify translational invariances that can be leveraged to build improved reduced-order models (ROMs). Invariances, whether translational or rotational, are well known to compromise the ability of ROMs to produce accurate and/or low-rank representations of the spatiotemporal dynamics. However, by discovering translations in a principled way, data can be shifted into a coordinate systems where quality, low-dimensional ROMs can be constructed. This approach can be used on either numerical or experimental data with or without knowledge of the governing equations. We demonstrate our method on a variety of PDEs of increasing difficulty, taken from the field of fluid dynamics, showing the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach.">

        <tr id="Identifying differential operators from data is essential for the mathematical modeling of complex physical and biological systems where massive datasets are available. These operators must be stable for accurate predictions for dynamics forecasting problems. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for learning sparse differential operators that are theoretically linearly stable by solving a constrained regression problem. These underlying constraints are obtained following linear stability for dynamical systems. We further extend this approach for learning nonlinear differential operators by determining linear stability constraints for linearized equations around an equilibrium point. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated for both linear and nonlinear partial differential equations such as 1-D scalar advection-diffusion equation, 1-D Burgers equation and 2-D advection equation. The results indicated that solutions to constrained regression problems with linear stability constraints provide accurate and linearly stable sparse differential operators.">

It can be used to find the corresponding governing equations in terms of differential equations from some provided spatial and time series data. The problem can be reduced to solve by sparse linear regression technique that can be referred to one of the powerful technique in machine learning algorithm. Here we propose to apply the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) and then study the capability of its predictions. The environmental problem involves advection and diffusion effects are demonstrated to show the accuracy and the efficiency for finding all of the coefficients in the partial differential equation corresponding to the input data.">

        <tr id="The paper presents a general strategy to solve ordinary differential equations (ODE), where some coefficient depend on the spatial variable and on additional random variables. The approach is based on the application of a recently developed dimension-incremental sparse fast Fourier transform. Since such algorithms require periodic signals, we discuss periodization strategies and associated necessary deperiodization modifications within the occurring solution steps. The computed approximate solutions of the ODE depend on the spatial variable and on the random variables as well. Certainly, one of the crucial challenges of the high-dimensional approximation process is to rate the influence of each variable on the solution as well as the determination of the relations and couplings within the set of variables. The suggested approach meets these challenges in a full automatic manner with reasonable computational costs, i.e., in contrast to already existing approaches, one does not need to seriously restrict the used set of ansatz functions in advance.">

        <tr id="The data-driven modeling of dynamical systems has become an essential tool for the construction of accurate computational models from real-world data. In this process, the inherent differential structures underlying the considered physical phenomena are often neglected making the reinterpretation of the learned models in a physically meaningful sense very challenging. In this work, we present three data-driven modeling approaches for the construction of dynamical systems with second-order differential structure directly from frequency domain data. Based on the second-order structured barycentric form, we extend the well-known Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson algorithm to the case of second-order systems. Depending on the available computational resources, we propose variations of the proposed method that prioritize either higher computation speed or greater modeling accuracy, and we present a theoretical analysis for the expected accuracy and performance of the proposed methods. Three numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our new structured approaches in comparison to classical unstructured data-driven modeling.">

        <tr id="The numerical computation of derivatives is ubiquitous in every scientific discipline and engineering application because derivatives express fundamental relationships among many quantities of interest. As a result, a large number of diverse algorithms have been developed to differentiate numerical data. These efforts are challenging because, in reality, practitioners often have sparse and noisy measurements and data, which undermine the ability to estimate accurate derivatives. Among the diversity of mathematical approaches that have been formulated, many are ad hoc in nature and require significant bespoke tuning of multiple parameters to produce reasonable results. Thus, at a practical level, it is often unclear which method should be used, how to choose parameters, and how to compare results from different methods.">
