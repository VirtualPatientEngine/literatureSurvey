        <tr id="Many important problems can be modeled as a system of interconnected entities, where each entity is recording time-dependent observations or measurements. In order to spot trends, detect anomalies, and interpret the temporal dynamics of such data, it is essential to understand the relationships between the different entities and how these relationships evolve over time. In this paper, we introduce the time-varying graphical lasso (TVGL), a method of inferring time-varying networks from raw time series data. We cast the problem in terms of estimating a sparse time-varying inverse covariance matrix, which reveals a dynamic network of interdependencies between the entities. Since dynamic network inference is a computationally expensive task, we derive a scalable message-passing algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve this problem in an efficient way. We also discuss several extensions, including a streaming algorithm to update the model and incorporate new observations in real time. Finally, we evaluate our TVGL algorithm on both real and synthetic datasets, obtaining interpretable results and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both accuracy and scalability.">

        <tr id="Complex systems are characterized by intricate interactions between entities that evolve dynamically over time. Accurate inference of these dynamic relationships is crucial for understanding and predicting system behavior. In this paper, we propose Regulatory Temporal Interaction Network Inference (RiTINI) for inferring time-varying interaction graphs in complex systems using a novel combination of space-and-time graph attentions and graph neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RiTINI leverages time-lapse signals on a graph prior, as well as perturbations of signals at various nodes in order to effectively capture the dynamics of the underlying system. This approach is distinct from traditional causal inference networks, which are limited to inferring acyclic and static graphs. In contrast, RiTINI can infer cyclic, directed, and time-varying graphs, providing a more comprehensive and accurate representation of complex systems. The graph attention mechanism in RiTINI allows the model to adaptively focus on the most relevant interactions in time and space, while the graph neural ODEs enable continuous-time modeling of the system's dynamics. We evaluate RiTINI's performance on various simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art capability in inferring interaction graphs compared to previous methods.">

We develop an inference method whose output is an undirected weighted network, where the weight of an edge between two nodes denotes the probability of these nodes being functionally connected. Two nodes are assumed to be functionally connected if they show significantly more coincident or short-lagged events than randomly picked pairs of nodes with similar levels of activity. We develop a model of time-varying connectivity whose parameters are determined by maximising the model’s predictive power from one time window to the next.

In this talk, I will present our recent work on mining such multiple networks. First, we will present several new data models, whose key idea is to leverage networks as context to connect different data sets or different data mining models, including a network of networks (NoN) model, a network of co-evolving time series (NoT) model and a network of regression model. Second, we will present some algorithmic examples on how to perform mining with such new models where the key idea is to leverage the contextual network as an effective regularizer during the mining process, including ranking, imputation, prediction and inference. Finally, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of our new models and algorithms in some applications, including bioinformatics, sensor networks, critical infrastructure networks and scholarly data mining.">

        <tr id="One of the main modelling paradigms for complex physical systems are networks. When estimating the network structure from measured signals, typically several assumptions such as stationarity are made in the estimation process. Violating these assumptions renders standard analysis techniques fruitless. We here propose a framework to estimate the network structure from measurements of arbitrary non-linear, non-stationary, stochastic processes. To this end, we propose a rigorous mathematical theory that underlies this framework. Based on this theory, we present a highly efficient algorithm and the corresponding statistics that are immediately sensibly applicable to measured signals. We demonstrate its performance in a simulation study. In experiments of transitions between vigilance stages in rodents, we infer small network structures with complex, time-dependent interactions; this suggests biomarkers for such transitions, the key to understand and diagnose numerous diseases such as dementia. We argue that the suggested framework combines features that other approaches followed so far lack.">

        <tr id="We consider the problem of inferring the functional connectivity of a large-scale computer network from sparse time series of events emitted by its nodes. We do so under the following three domain-specific constraints: (a) non-stationarity of the functional connectivity due to unknown temporal changes in the network, (b) sparsity of the time-series of events that limits the effectiveness of classical correlation-based analysis, and (c) lack of an explicit model describing how events propagate through the network. Under the assumption that the probability of two nodes being functionally connected correlates with the mean delay between their respective events, we develop an inference method whose output is an undirected weighted network where the weight of an edge between two nodes denotes the probability of these nodes being functionally connected. Using a combination of windowing and convolution to calculate at each time window a score quantifying the likelihood of a pair of nodes emitting events in quick succession, we develop a model of time-varying connectivity whose parameters are determined by maximising the model's predictive power from one time window to the next. To assess the effectiveness of our inference method, we construct synthetic data for which ground truth is available and use these data to benchmark our approach against three state-of-the-art inference methods. We conclude by discussing its application to data from a real-world large-scale computer network.">

        <tr id="The ability to quantify the level of regularity in an individual's patterns of visiting a particular location provides valuable context in many areas, such as urban planning, reality mining, and opportunistic networks. However, in many cases, visit data is only available as zero-duration events, precluding the application of methods that require continuous, densely-sampled data. To address this, our approach in this paper takes inspiration from an established body of research in the neural coding community that deals with the similar problem of finding patterns in event-based data. We adapt a neural synchrony measure to develop a method of quantifying the regularity of an individual's visits to a location, where regularity is defined as the level of similarity in weekly visiting patterns. We apply this method to study regularity in three real-world datasets, specifically, a metropolitan transport system, a university campus, and an online location-sharing service. Among our findings we identify a core group of individuals in each dataset that visited at least one location with near-perfect regularity.">

        <tr id="Modeling temporal event sequences on the vertices of a network is an important problem with widespread applications; examples include modeling influences in social networks, preventing crimes by modeling their space–time occurrences, and forecasting earthquakes. Existing solutions for this problem use a parametric approach, whose applicability is limited to event sequences following some well‐known distributions, which is not true for many real life event datasets. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we propose a composite recurrent neural network model for learning events occurring in the vertices of a network over time. Our proposed model combines two long short‐term memory units to capture base intensity and conditional intensity of an event sequence. We also introduce a second‐order statistic loss that penalizes higher divergence between the generated and the target sequence's distribution of hop count distance of consecutive events. Given a sequence of vertices of a network in which an event has occurred, the proposed model predicts the vertex where the next event would most likely occur. Experimental results on synthetic and real‐world datasets validate the superiority of our proposed model in comparison to various baseline methods.">
