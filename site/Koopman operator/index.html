        <tr id="A majority of methods from dynamical system analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincaré's geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states." While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept, we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.">

        <tr id="In this work, we explore finite-dimensional linear representations of nonlinear dynamical systems by restricting the Koopman operator to an invariant subspace spanned by specially chosen observable functions. The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that evolves functions of the state of a dynamical system. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the state variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too restrictive for nonlinear systems. Choosing the right nonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is possible to obtain linear reduced-order models, especially those that are useful for control, is an open challenge. Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis that enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems. First, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the observable subspace, as in DMD. However, we find that this is only possible when there is a single isolated fixed point, as systems with multiple fixed points or more complicated attractors are not globally topologically conjugate to a finite-dimensional linear system, and cannot be represented by a finite-dimensional linear Koopman subspace that includes the state. We then present a data-driven strategy to identify relevant observable functions for Koopman analysis by leveraging a new algorithm to determine relevant terms in a dynamical system by ℓ1-regularized regression of the data in a nonlinear function space; we also show how this algorithm is related to DMD. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of nonlinear observable subspaces in the design of Koopman operator optimal control laws for fully nonlinear systems using techniques from linear optimal control.">

        <tr id="We develop a deep autoencoder architecture that can be used to find a coordinate transformation which turns a non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) into a linear PDE. Our architecture is motivated by the linearising transformations provided by the Cole–Hopf transform for Burgers’ equation and the inverse scattering transform for completely integrable PDEs. By leveraging a residual network architecture, a near-identity transformation can be exploited to encode intrinsic coordinates in which the dynamics are linear. The resulting dynamics are given by a Koopman operator matrix K. The decoder allows us to transform back to the original coordinates as well. Multiple time step prediction can be performed by repeated multiplication by the matrix K in the intrinsic coordinates. We demonstrate our method on a number of examples, including the heat equation and Burgers’ equation, as well as the substantially more challenging Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, showing that our method provides a robust architecture for discovering linearising transforms for non-linear PDEs.">

        <tr id="We propose spectral methods for long-term forecasting of temporal signals stemming from linear and nonlinear quasi-periodic dynamical systems. For linear signals, we introduce an algorithm with similarities to the Fourier transform but which does not rely on periodicity assumptions, allowing for forecasting given potentially arbitrary sampling intervals. We then extend this algorithm to handle nonlinearities by leveraging Koopman theory. The resulting algorithm performs a spectral decomposition in a nonlinear, data-dependent basis. The optimization objective for both algorithms is highly non-convex. However, expressing the objective in the frequency domain allows us to compute global optima of the error surface in a scalable and efficient manner, partially by exploiting the computational properties of the Fast Fourier Transform. Because of their close relation to Bayesian Spectral Analysis, uncertainty quantification metrics are a natural byproduct of the spectral forecasting methods. We extensively benchmark these algorithms against other leading forecasting methods on a range of synthetic experiments as well as in the context of real-world power systems and fluid flows.">

        <tr id="The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science. First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator theoretic or probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due primarily to three key factors: 1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems, 2) the approach is formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big-data and machine learning techniques, and 3) simple, yet powerful numerical algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications. In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory, describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that linearize nonlinear dynamical systems, facilitating the study of their spectral properties and enabling the prediction of the time evolution of observable quantities. Recent methods have aimed to approximate Koopman operators while preserving key structures. However, approximating Koopman operators typically requires a dictionary of observables to capture the system's behavior in a finite-dimensional subspace. The selection of these functions is often heuristic, may result in the loss of spectral information, and can severely complicate structure preservation. This paper introduces Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition (MultDMD), which enforces the multiplicative structure inherent in the Koopman operator within its finite-dimensional approximation. Leveraging this multiplicative property, we guide the selection of observables and define a constrained optimization problem for the matrix approximation, which can be efficiently solved. MultDMD presents a structured approach to finite-dimensional approximations and can more accurately reflect the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We elaborate on the theoretical framework of MultDMD, detailing its formulation, optimization strategy, and convergence properties. The efficacy of MultDMD is demonstrated through several examples, including the nonlinear pendulum, the Lorenz system, and fluid dynamics data, where we demonstrate its remarkable robustness to noise.">

        <tr id="Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.">

        <tr id="Linearity of Koopman operators and simplicity of their estimators coupled with model-reduction capabilities has lead to their great popularity in applications for learning dynamical systems. While nonparametric Koopman operator learning in infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces is well understood for autonomous systems, its control system analogues are largely unexplored. Addressing systems with control inputs in a principled manner is crucial for fully data-driven learning of controllers, especially since existing approaches commonly resort to representational heuristics or parametric models of limited expressiveness and scalability. We address the aforementioned challenge by proposing a universal framework via control-affine reproducing kernels that enables direct estimation of a single operator even for control systems. The proposed approach, called control-Koopman operator regression (cKOR), is thus completely analogous to Koopman operator regression of the autonomous case. First in the literature, we present a nonparametric framework for learning Koopman operator representations of nonlinear control-affine systems that does not suffer from the curse of control input dimensionality. This allows for reformulating the infinite-dimensional learning problem in a finite-dimensional space based solely on data without apriori loss of precision due to a restriction to a finite span of functions or inputs as in other approaches. For enabling applications to large-scale control systems, we also enhance the scalability of control-Koopman operator estimators by leveraging random projections (sketching). The efficacy of our novel cKOR approach is demonstrated on both forecasting and control tasks.">

        <tr id="Quadrotor systems are common and beneficial for many fields, but their intricate behavior often makes it challenging to design effective and optimal control strategies. Some traditional approaches to nonlinear control often rely on local linearizations or complex nonlinear models, which can be inaccurate or computationally expensive. We present a data-driven approach to identify the dynamics of a given quadrotor system using Koopman operator theory. Koopman theory offers a framework for representing nonlinear dynamics as linear operators acting on observable functions of the state space. This allows to approximate nonlinear systems with globally linear models in a higher dimensional space, which can be analyzed and controlled using standard linear optimal control techniques. We leverage the method of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to identify Koopman operator from data with total least squares. We demonstrate that the identified model can be stabilized and controllable by designing a controller using linear quadratic regulator (LQR).">

        <tr id="The discovery of linear embedding is the key to the synthesis of linear control techniques for nonlinear systems. In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modelling techniques provide a method for deriving models of dynamical systems directly from complicated data streams. However, tracking and forecasting such data streams poses a significant challenge to most methods, as they assume the underlying process and model does not change over time. In this paper, we apply one such data-driven method, the Koopman autoencoder (KAE), to high-dimensional oscillatory data to generate a low-dimensional latent space and model, where the system's dynamics appear linear. This allows one to accurately track and forecast systems where the underlying model may change over time. States and the model in the reduced order latent space can then be efficiently updated as new data becomes available, using data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), in a technique we call the KAE EnKF. We demonstrate that this approach is able to effectively track and forecast time-varying, nonlinear dynamical systems in synthetic examples. We then apply the KAE EnKF to a video of a physical pendulum, and achieve a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. By generating effective latent space reconstructions, we find that we are able to construct accurate short-term forecasts and efficient adaptations to externally forced changes to the pendulum's frequency.">

Our method relies on an orthogonal projection on polynomial subspaces, which is equivalent to Taylor approximation in a data-driven setting. In the case of dynamics with a hyperbolic equilibrium, the method demonstrates excellent performance to capture the lattice structured Koopman spectrum based on the eigenvalues of the linearized system at the equilibrium. Moreover, it yields the Taylor approximation of associated principal eigenfunctions. Since the method preserves the triangular structure of the operator, it does not suffer from spectral pollution and, moreover, arbitrary accuracy on the spectrum can be reached with a fixed finite dimension of the approximation.">

        <tr id="Reduced order models are becoming increasingly important for rendering complex and multiscale spatio-temporal dynamics computationally tractable. The computational efficiency of such surrogate models is especially important for design, exhaustive exploration and physical understanding. Plasma simulations, in particular those applied to the study of ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ plasma discharges and technologies, such as Hall thrusters, require substantial computational resources in order to resolve the multidimentional dynamics that span across wide spatial and temporal scales. Although high-fidelity computational tools are available to simulate such systems over limited conditions and in highly simplified geometries, simulations of full-size systems and/or extensive parametric studies over many geometric configurations and under different physical conditions are computationally intractable with conventional numerical tools. Thus, scientific studies and industrially oriented modeling of plasma systems, including the important ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ technologies, stand to significantly benefit from reduced order modeling algorithms. We develop a model reduction scheme based upon a {\em Shallow REcurrent Decoder} (SHRED) architecture. The scheme uses a neural network for encoding limited sensor measurements in time (sequence-to-sequence encoding) to full state-space reconstructions via a decoder network. Based upon the theory of separation of variables, the SHRED architecture is capable of (i) reconstructing full spatio-temporal fields with as little as three point sensors, even the fields that are not measured with sensor feeds but that are in dynamic coupling with the measured field, and (ii) forecasting the future state of the system using neural network roll-outs from the trained time encoding model.">

        <tr id="We introduce a method for constructing reduced-order models directly from videos of dynamical systems. The method uses a non-intrusive tracking to isolate the motion of a user-selected part in the video of an autonomous dynamical system. In the space of delayed observations of this motion, we reconstruct a low-dimensional attracting spectral submanifold (SSM) whose internal dynamics serves as a mathematically justified reduced-order model for nearby motions of the full system. We obtain this model in a simple polynomial form that allows explicit identification of important physical system parameters, such as natural frequencies, linear and nonlinear damping and nonlinear stiffness. Beyond faithfully reproducing attracting steady states and limit cycles, our SSM-reduced models can also uncover hidden motion not seen in the video, such as unstable fixed points and unstable limit cycles forming basin boundaries. We demonstrate all these features on experimental videos of five physical systems: a double pendulum, an inverted flag in counter-flow, water sloshing in tank, a wing exhibiting aeroelastic flutter and a shimmying wheel.">

        <tr id="When neural networks are trained from data to simulate the dynamics of physical systems, they encounter a persistent challenge: the long-time dynamics they produce are often unphysical or unstable. We analyze the origin of such instabilities when learning linear dynamical systems, focusing on the training dynamics. We make several analytical findings which empirical observations suggest extend to nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems, e.g. in climate and engineering sciences, often necessitates solving partial differential equations. Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

        <tr id="The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective technique to produce interpretable models of dynamical systems from time-resolved state data via sparse regression. However, to model parameterized systems, SINDy requires data from transient trajectories for various parameter values over the range of interest, which are typically difficult to acquire experimentally. In this work, we extend SINDy to be able to leverage data on fixed points and/or limit cycles to reduce the number of transient trajectories needed for successful system identification. To achieve this, we incorporate the data on these attractors at various parameter values as constraints in the optimization problem. First, we show that enforcing these as hard constraints leads to an ill-conditioned regression problem due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we implement soft constraints by modifying the cost function to be minimized. This leads to the formulation of a multi-objective sparse regression problem where we simultaneously seek to minimize the error of the fit to the transients trajectories and to the data on attractors, while penalizing the number of terms in the model. Our extension, demonstrated on several numerical examples, is more robust to noisy measurements and requires substantially less training data than the original SINDy method to correctly identify a parameterized dynamical system.">

        <tr id="This paper is about learning the parameter-to-solution map for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) that depend on a potentially large number of parameters covering all PDE types for which a stable variational formulation (SVF) can be found. A central constituent is the notion of variationally correct residual loss function meaning that its value is always uniformly proportional to the squared solution error in the norm determined by the SVF, hence facilitating rigorous a posteriori accuracy control. It is based on a single variational problem, associated with the family of parameter dependent fiber problems, employing the notion of direct integrals of Hilbert spaces. Since in its original form the loss function is given as a dual test norm of the residual a central objective is to develop equivalent computable expressions. A first critical role is played by hybrid hypothesis classes, whose elements are piecewise polynomial in (low-dimensional) spatio-temporal variables with parameter-dependent coefficients that can be represented, e.g. by neural networks. Second, working with first order SVFs, we distinguish two scenarios: (i) the test space can be chosen as an $L_2$-space (e.g. for elliptic or parabolic problems) so that residuals live in $L_2$ and can be evaluated directly; (ii) when trial and test spaces for the fiber problems (e.g. for transport equations) depend on the parameters, we use ultraweak formulations. In combination with Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin concepts the hybrid format is then instrumental to arrive at variationally correct computable residual loss functions. Our findings are illustrated by numerical experiments representing (i) and (ii), namely elliptic boundary value problems with piecewise constant diffusion coefficients and pure transport equations with parameter dependent convection field.">

However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.">

        <tr id="Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time-series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces, for which we prove a universal approximation result. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.">

        <tr id="Reduced order modeling lowers the computational cost of solving PDEs by learning a low-order spatial representation from data and dynamically evolving these representations using manifold projections of the governing equations. While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.">

First, we show the spectral signature depending on singular perturbation: how two Koopman principle eigenvalues are ordered and what distinct shapes emerge in their associated Koopman eigenfunctions. Second, we discuss the singular limit of the Koopman operator, which is derived through the concatenation of Koopman operators for the fast and slow subsystems. From the spectral properties of the Koopman operator for the singularl-perturbed system and the singular limit, we suggest that the Koopman eigenfunctions inherit geometric properties of the singularly-perturbed system.

The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction. We experimentally confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for two Hamiltonian dynamical systems.">

The majority of dynamical systems arising from applications show a chaotic character. This is especially true for climate and weather applications. We present here an application of Koopman operator theory to tropical and global SST that yields an approximation to the continuous spectrum typical of these situations. We also show that the Koopman modes yield a decomposition of the data sets that can be used to categorize the variability. Most relevant modes emerge naturally and they can be identified easily. A difference with other analysis methods such as EOF or Fourier expansion is that the Koopman modes have a dynamical interpretation thanks to their connection to the Koopman operator and they are not constrained in their shape by special requirements such as orthogonality (as it is the case for EOF) or pure periodicity (as in the case of Fourier expansions). The pure periodic modes emerge naturally and they form a subspace that can be interpreted as the limiting subspace for the variability. The stationary states therefore are the scaffolding around which the dynamics takes place. The modes can also be traced to the NINO variability and in the case of the global SST to the PDO.">

However, their implementation necessitates optimizing a high-dimensional space of parameters and hyperparameters. This fact, along with the requirement of substantial computational resources, poses a barrier to achieving high numerical accuracy. Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs. We show, that for this particular task, RandONets outperform, both in terms of numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, the ``vanilla"DeepOnets.">

NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some"optimal"coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.">

We contrast our approach to more common ones based on the transfer operator, showing that it can provably learn the spectral properties of the unbiased system from biased data. In experiments, we highlight the advantages of our method over transfer operator approaches and recent developments based on generator learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.

However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm. In the implementation phase, to show the effectiveness of GN-SINDy, we compare its results with DeePyMoD by using a Python package that is prepared for this purpose on numerous PDE discovery">

        <tr id="In a landscape where scientific discovery is increasingly driven by data, the integration of machine learning (ML) with traditional scientific methodologies has emerged as a transformative approach. This paper introduces a novel, data-driven framework that synergizes physics-based priors with advanced ML techniques to address the computational and practical limitations inherent in first-principle-based methods and brute-force machine learning methods. Our framework showcases four algorithms, each embedding a specific physics-based prior tailored to a particular class of nonlinear systems, including separable and nonseparable Hamiltonian systems, hyperbolic partial differential equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics. The intrinsic incorporation of physical laws preserves the system's intrinsic symmetries and conservation laws, ensuring solutions are physically plausible and computationally efficient. The integration of these priors also enhances the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns typical in physical phenomena that conventional methods often miss. As a result, our models outperform existing data-driven techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, and predictive capability, particularly in recognizing features absent from the training set, despite relying on small datasets, short training periods, and small sample sizes.">

        <tr id="This paper is concerned with collective variables, or reaction coordinates, that map a discrete-in-time Markov process $X_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to a (much) smaller dimension $k \ll d$. We define the effective dynamics under a given collective variable map $\xi$ as the best Markovian representation of $X_n$ under $\xi$. The novelty of the paper is that it gives strict criteria for selecting optimal collective variables via the properties of the effective dynamics. In particular, we show that the transition density of the effective dynamics of the optimal collective variable solves a relative entropy minimization problem from certain family of densities to the transition density of $X_n$. We also show that many transfer operator-based data-driven numerical approaches essentially learn quantities of the effective dynamics. Furthermore, we obtain various error estimates for the effective dynamics in approximating dominant timescales / eigenvalues and transition rates of the original process $X_n$ and how optimal collective variables minimize these errors. Our results contribute to the development of theoretical tools for the understanding of complex dynamical systems, e.g. molecular kinetics, on large timescales. These results shed light on the relations among existing data-driven numerical approaches for identifying good collective variables, and they also motivate the development of new methods.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in aerial robotics have enabled the use of multirotor vehicles for autonomous payload transportation. Resorting only to classical methods to reliably model a quadrotor carrying a cable-slung load poses significant challenges. On the other hand, purely data-driven learning methods do not comply by design with the problem's physical constraints, especially in states that are not densely represented in training data. In this work, we explore the use of physics informed neural networks to learn an end-to-end model of the multirotor-slung-load system and, at a given time, estimate a sequence of the future system states. An LSTM encoder decoder with an attention mechanism is used to capture the dynamics of the system. To guarantee the cohesiveness between the multiple predicted states of the system, we propose the use of a physics-based term in the loss function, which includes a discretized physical model derived from first principles together with slack variables that allow for a small mismatch between expected and predicted values. To train the model, a dataset using a real-world quadrotor carrying a slung load was curated and is made available. Prediction results are presented and corroborate the feasibility of the approach. The proposed method outperforms both the first principles physical model and a comparable neural network model trained without the physics regularization proposed.">

While these operators perform effectively in either the time or frequency domain, their performance may be limited when applied to non-stationary spatial or temporal signals whose frequency characteristics change with time. Here, we introduce Complex Neural Operator (CoNO) that parameterizes the integral kernel using Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), better representing non-stationary signals in a complex-valued domain. Theoretically, we prove the universal approximation capability of CoNO. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of CoNO on seven challenging partial differential equations (PDEs), including regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds. Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data. Altogether, CoNO presents a robust and superior model for modeling continuous dynamical systems, providing a fillip to scientific machine learning.">

More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

In this paper we leverage the universal approximation properties of neural networks (NNs) to develop neural DeePC algorithms for nonlinear systems. Firstly, we point out that the outputs of the last hidden layer of a deep NN implicitly construct a basis in a so-called neural (feature) space, while the output linear layer performs affine interpolation in the neural space. As such, we can train off-line a deep NN using large data sets of trajectories to learn the neural basis and compute on-line a suitable affine interpolation using DeePC. Secondly, methods for guaranteeing consistency of neural DeePC and for reducing computational complexity are developed. Several neural DeePC formulations are illustrated on a nonlinear pendulum example.">

It has broad applications in fields such as Bayesian inference, financial mathematics, control theory, and shape analysis. However, simulating the diffusion bridge for natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain unresolved. In the paper, we present a solution to this problem by merging score-matching techniques with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to score-matching for the infinite-dimensional bridge. We construct the score to be discretization invariant, which is natural given the underlying spatially continuous process. We conduct a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data, and our method demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution without extra training.">

Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict.

To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

More precisely, the input space $\mathfrak X$ is allowed to be a general topological space satisfying only a mild condition ("quasi-Polish"), and the output space can be either another quasi-Polish space $\mathfrak Y$ or a topological vector space $E$. Similarly to arXiv:2109.13512v4, we show furthermore that our neural network architectures can be projected down to"finite dimensional"subspaces with any desirable accuracy, thus obtaining approximating networks that are easy to implement and allow for fast computation and fitting. The resulting neural network architecture is therefore applicable for prediction tasks based on functional data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result which deals with such a wide class of input/output spaces and simultaneously guarantees the numerical feasibility of the ensuing architectures. Finally, we prove an obstruction result which indicates that the category of quasi-Polish spaces is in a certain sense the correct category to work with if one aims at constructing approximating architectures on infinite-dimensional spaces $\mathfrak X$ which, at the same time, have sufficient expressive power to approximate continuous functions on $\mathfrak X$, are specified by a finite number of parameters only and are"stable"with respect to these parameters.">

However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.">

        <tr id="Large-scale recordings of neural activity over broad anatomical areas with high spatial and temporal resolution are increasingly common in modern experimental neuroscience. Recently, recurrent switching dynamical systems have been used to tackle the scale and complexity of these data. However, an important challenge remains in providing insights into the existence and structure of recurrent linear dynamics in neural time series data. Here we test a scalable approach to time-varying autoregression with low-rank tensors to recover the recurrent dynamics in stochastic neural mass models with multiple stable attractors. We demonstrate that the sparse representation of time-varying system matrices in terms of temporal modes can recover the attractor structure of simple systems via clustering. We then consider simulations based on a human brain connectivity matrix in high and low global connection strength regimes, and reveal the hierarchical clustering structure of the dynamics. Finally, we explain the impact of the forecast time delay on the estimation of the underlying rank and temporal variability of the time series dynamics. This study illustrates that prediction error minimization is not sufficient to recover meaningful dynamic structure and that it is crucial to account for the three key timescales arising from dynamics, noise processes, and attractor switching.">

        <tr id="Identifying Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) from measurement data requires both fitting the dynamics and assimilating, either implicitly or explicitly, the measurement data. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method involves a derivative estimation step (and optionally, smoothing) and a sparse regression step on a library of candidate ODE terms. Kalman smoothing is a classical framework for assimilating the measurement data with known noise statistics. Previously, derivatives in SINDy and its python package, pysindy, had been estimated by finite difference, L1 total variation minimization, or local filters like Savitzky-Golay. In contrast, Kalman allows discovering ODEs that best recreate the essential dynamics in simulation, even in cases when it does not perform as well at recovering coefficients, as measured by their F1 score and mean absolute error. We have incorporated Kalman smoothing, along with hyperparameter optimization, into the existing pysindy architecture, allowing for rapid adoption of the method. Numerical experiments on a number of dynamical systems show Kalman smoothing to be the most amenable to parameter selection and best at preserving problem structure in the presence of noise.">

Our basic assumption is that the governing equations for the stochastic system are unavailable. However, short bursts of input/output (I/O) data consisting of certain known excitation signals and their corresponding system responses are available. When a sufficient amount of such I/O data are available, our method is capable of learning the unknown dynamics and producing an accurate predictive model for the stochastic responses of the system subject to arbitrary excitation signals not in the training data. Our method has two key components: (1) a local approximation of the training I/O data to transfer the learning into a parameterized form; and (2) a generative model to approximate the underlying unknown stochastic flow map in distribution. After presenting the method in detail, we present a comprehensive set of numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, especially for long-term system predictions.">

The resulting $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimality framework neatly generalizes the analogous Gramian-based optimality framework for purely linear systems. Computationally, we show how to enforce the necessary optimality conditions using Petrov-Galerkin projection; the corresponding projection matrices are obtained from a pair of Sylvester equations. Based on this result, we propose an iteratively corrected algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$ model reduction of LQO systems, which we refer to as LQO-TSIA (linear quadratic output two-sided iteration algorithm).

The machine learning model overcomes the inherent limitations in traditional long short-time memory networks by exploiting a conditional Gaussian structure informed of the essential physical dynamics. The model performance is demonstrated under a prototype model from idealized geophysical flow and passive tracers, which exhibits analytical solutions with representative statistical features. Many attractive properties are found in the trained model in recovering the hidden dynamics using a limited dataset and sparse observation time, showing uniformly high skill with persistent numerical stability in predicting both the trajectory and statistical solutions among different statistical regimes away from the training regime.

Due to their inherent nonlinear dynamics and memory, they can learn unbounded temporal dependencies from data. In a Machine Learning setting, the network's parameters are adapted during a training phase to match the requirements of a given task/problem increasing its computational capabilities. After the training, the network parameters are kept fixed to exploit the learned computations. The static parameters thereby render the network unadaptive to changing conditions, such as external or internal perturbation. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how keeping parts of the network adaptive even after the training enhances its functionality and robustness. Here, we utilize the conceptor framework and conceptualize an adaptive control loop analyzing the network's behavior continuously and adjusting its time-varying internal representation to follow a desired target. We demonstrate how the added adaptivity of the network supports the computational functionality in three distinct tasks: interpolation of temporal patterns, stabilization against partial network degradation, and robustness against input distortion. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive networks in machine learning beyond training, enabling them to not only learn complex patterns but also dynamically adjust to changing environments, ultimately broadening their applicability.">

        <tr id="Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs and susceptibility to local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

Our approach integrates physical priors through an energy-based risk metric in both full and partial knowledge settings. We evaluate the statistical performance of a reduced-rank estimator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) in the partial knowledge setting. Notably, our approach provides learning bounds independent of the state space dimension and ensures non-spurious spectral estimation.

The coefficients in the kernel model are determined using randomized linear algebra, leading to a runtime that scales linearly in the number of data points. In numerical experiments involving a triple-well potential and alanine dipeptide, the FCM yields higher accuracy and trains more quickly than a neural network with the same number of parameters.

Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

Our analysis extends these findings by exploring error bounds beyond the traditional dissipative condition, thereby broadening the scope of quantum computational benefits to a new class of dynamical regimes. This novel regime is defined by a resonance condition, and we prove how this resonance condition leads to a linear convergence with respect to the truncation level $N$ in Carleman linearization.

However, they often fail to achieve the same level of accuracy as classical methods in solving differential equations. In this paper, we identify two sources of this issue in the case of Cauchy problems: the use of $L^2$ residuals as objective functions and the approximation gap of neural networks. We show that minimizing the sum of $L^2$ residual and initial condition error is not sufficient to guarantee the true solution, as this loss function does not capture the underlying dynamics. Additionally, neural networks are not capable of capturing singularities in the solutions due to the non-compactness of their image sets. This, in turn, influences the existence of global minima and the regularity of the network. We demonstrate that when the global minimum does not exist, machine precision becomes the predominant source of achievable error in practice. We also present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.">

Among those, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) stands out as a successful method capable of modeling governing equations with a minimal number of terms, utilizing the principles of compressive sensing. This feature, which relies on a small number of terms, is crucial for interpretability. The effectiveness of SINDy hinges on the choice of candidate functions within its dictionary to extract governing equations of dynamical systems. A larger dictionary allows for more terms, enhancing the quality of approximations. However, the computational complexity scales with dictionary size, rendering SINDy less suitable for high-dimensional datasets, even though it has been successfully applied to low-dimensional datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce iterative SINDy in this paper, where the dictionary undergoes expansion and compression through iterations. We also conduct an analysis of the convergence properties of iterative SINDy. Simulation results validate that iterative SINDy can achieve nearly identical performance to SINDy, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Notably, iterative SINDy demonstrates effectiveness with high-dimensional time-series data without incurring the prohibitively high computational cost associated with SINDy.">

        <tr id="The sudden onset of deleterious and oscillatory dynamics (often called instabilities) is a known challenge in many fluid, plasma, and aerospace systems. These dynamics are difficult to address because they are nonlinear, chaotic, and are often too fast for active control schemes. In this work, we develop an alternative active controls system using an iterative, trajectory-optimization and parameter-tuning approach based on Iterative Learning Control (ILC), Time-Lagged Phase Portraits (TLPP) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The novelty of this approach is that it can control a system's dynamics despite the controller being much slower than the dynamics. We demonstrate this controller on the Lorenz system of equations where it iteratively adjusts (tunes) the system's input parameters to successfully reproduce a desired oscillatory trajectory or state. Additionally, we investigate the system's dynamical sensitivity to its control parameters, identify continuous and bounded regions of desired dynamical trajectories, and demonstrate that the controller is robust to missing information and uncontrollable parameters as long as certain requirements are met. The controller presented in this work provides a framework for low-speed control for a variety of fast, nonlinear systems that may aid in instability suppression and mitigation.">

        <tr id="In this article, we consider two dynamical systems: the McMillan sextupole and octupole integrable mappings, originally proposed by Edwin McMillan. Both represent the simplest symmetric McMillan maps, characterized by a single intrinsic parameter. While these systems find numerous applications across various domains of mathematics and physics, some of their dynamical properties remain unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive description of all stable trajectories, including the parametrization of invariant curves, Poincar\'e rotation numbers, and canonical action-angle variables. In the second part, we establish connections between these maps and general chaotic maps in standard form. Our investigation reveals that the McMillan sextupole and octupole serve as first-order approximations of the dynamics around the fixed point, akin to the linear map and quadratic invariant (known as the Courant-Snyder invariant in accelerator physics), which represents zeroth-order approximations (referred to as linearization). Furthermore, we propose a novel formalism for nonlinear Twiss parameters, which accounts for the dependence of rotation number on amplitude. This stands in contrast to conventional betatron phase advance used in accelerator physics, which remains independent of amplitude. Notably, in the context of accelerator physics, this new formalism demonstrates its capability in predicting dynamical aperture around low-order resonances for flat beams, a critical aspect in beam injection/extraction scenarios.">

Multiple coupling strategies have been developed to accelerate these simulations, but often use predictors in the form of simple finite-difference extrapolations.

Each reduced order model is composed of a nonlinear encoder-regressor-decoder architecture and is equipped with an adaptive update strategy that adds robustness for extrapolation. In doing so, the proposed methodology leverages physics-based insights from high-fidelity solvers, thus establishing a physics-aware machine learning predictor. Using three strongly coupled FSI examples, this study demonstrates the improved convergence obtained with the new predictor and the overall computational speedup realized compared to classical approaches.">

Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a novel and popular approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, achieving stable training and obtaining correct results remain a challenge in many cases, often attributed to the ill-conditioning of PINNs. Nonetheless, further analysis is still lacking, severely limiting the progress and applications of PINNs in complex engineering problems. Drawing inspiration from the ill-conditioning analysis in traditional numerical methods, we establish a connection between the ill-conditioning of PINNs and the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian matrix of the PDE system. Specifically, for any given PDE system, we construct its controlled system. This controlled system allows for adjustment of the condition number of the Jacobian matrix while retaining the same solution as the original system. Our numerical findings suggest that the ill-conditioning observed in PINNs predominantly stems from the Jacobian matrix. As the condition number of the Jacobian matrix decreases, PINNs exhibit faster convergence rates and higher accuracy. Building upon this understanding and the natural extension of controlled systems, we present a general approach to mitigate the ill-conditioning of PINNs, leading to successful simulations of the three-dimensional flow around the M6 wing at a Reynolds number of 5,000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PINNs have been successful in simulating such complex systems, offering a promising new technique for addressing industrial complexity problems. Our findings also offer valuable insights guiding the future development of PINNs.">

 In this work, we consider the problem of learning a reduced-order model of a high-dimensional stochastic nonlinear system with control inputs from noisy data. In particular, we develop a hybrid parametric/non-parametric model that learns the “average” linear dynamics in the data using dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) and the nonlinearities and model uncertainties using Gaussian process (GP) regression and compare it with total least squares dynamic mode decomposition, extended here to systems with control inputs (tlsDMDc). The proposed approach is also compared with existing methods, such as DMDc-only and GP-only models, in two tasks: controlling the stochastic nonlinear Stuart-Landau equation and predicting the flowfield induced by a jet-like body force field in a turbulent boundary layer using data from large-scale numerical simulations.">

We find that although the original KANs based on the B-splines parameterization lack accuracy and efficiency, modified versions based on low-order orthogonal polynomials have comparable performance to PINNs and DeepONet although they still lack robustness as they may diverge for different random seeds or higher order orthogonal polynomials. We visualize their corresponding loss landscapes and analyze their learning dynamics using information bottleneck theory.

        <tr id="Duality between estimation and control is a foundational concept in Control Theory. Most students learn about the elementary duality -- between observability and controllability -- in their first graduate course in linear systems theory. Therefore, it comes as a surprise that for a more general class of nonlinear stochastic systems (hidden Markov models or HMMs), duality is incomplete. Our objective in writing this article is two-fold: (i) To describe the difficulty in extending duality to HMMs; and (ii) To discuss its recent resolution by the authors. A key message is that the main difficulty in extending duality comes from time reversal in going from estimation to control. The reason for time reversal is explained with the aid of the familiar linear deterministic and linear Gaussian models. The explanation is used to motivate the difference between the linear and the nonlinear models. Once the difference is understood, duality for HMMs is described based on our recent work. The article also includes a comparison and discussion of the different types of duality considered in literature.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal Traffic Data (STTD) measures the complex dynamical behaviors of the multiscale transportation system. Existing methods aim to reconstruct STTD using low-dimensional models. However, they are limited to data-specific dimensions or source-dependent patterns, restricting them from unifying representations. Here, we present a novel paradigm to address the STTD learning problem by parameterizing STTD as an implicit neural representation. To discern the underlying dynamics in low-dimensional regimes, coordinate-based neural networks that can encode high-frequency structures are employed to directly map coordinates to traffic variables. To unravel the entangled spatial-temporal interactions, the variability is decomposed into separate processes. We further enable modeling in irregular spaces such as sensor graphs using spectral embedding. Through continuous representations, our approach enables the modeling of a variety of STTD with a unified input, thereby serving as a generalized learner of the underlying traffic dynamics. It is also shown that it can learn implicit low-rank priors and smoothness regularization from the data, making it versatile for learning different dominating data patterns. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments in real-world scenarios, showcasing applications from corridor to network scales. Empirical results not only indicate that our model has significant superiority over conventional low-rank models, but also highlight that the versatility of the approach extends to different data domains, output resolutions, and network topologies. Comprehensive model analyses provide further insight into the inductive bias of STTD. We anticipate that this pioneering modeling perspective could lay the foundation for universal representation of STTD in various real-world tasks.">

While achieving great successes in applications, the mathematical interpretation of LPD as a truncated iterative scheme is not necessarily sufficient to fully understand its properties. In this paper, we study the LPD with a general linear operator. We model the forward propagation of LPD as a system of difference equations and a system of differential equations in discrete- and continuous-time settings (for primal and dual variables/trajectories), which are named discrete-time LPD and continuous-time LPD, respectively. Forward analyses such as stabilities and the convergence of the state variables of the discrete-time LPD to the solution of continuous-time LPD are given. Moreover, we analyze the learning problems with/without regularization terms of both discrete-time and continuous-time LPD from the optimal control viewpoint. We prove convergence results of their optimal solutions with respect to the network state initialization and training data, showing in some sense the topological stability of the learning problems. We also establish convergence from the solution of the discrete-time LPD learning problem to that of the continuous-time LPD learning problem through a piecewise linear extension, under some appropriate assumptions on the space of learnable parameters. This study demonstrates theoretically the robustness of the LPD structure and the associated training process, and can induce some future research and applications.">

Neural networks represent a promising method of emulating the physics at low cost, and therefore have the potential to considerably improve and accelerate data assimilation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning approach where the physical system is modeled as a sequence of coarse-to-fine Gaussian prior distributions parametrized by a neural network. This allows us to define an assimilation operator, which is trained in an end-to-end fashion to minimize the reconstruction error on a dataset with different observation processes.

Prevalent examples include a) linear models where the signal lies in a low-dimensional subspace; b) sparse models where the signal can be represented by only a few coefficients under a suitable basis; and c) a large family of neural network generative models. In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets in orthogonal or unitary representations of groups: with a suitable dimension bound, a generic translate of any semi-algebraic set is transverse to the orbits of the group action. This, in turn, implies that if a signal lies in a low-dimensional semi-algebraic set, then it can be recovered uniquely from measurements that separate orbits. As an application, we consider the implications of the transversality theorem to the problem of recovering signals that are translated by random group actions from their second moment. As a special case, we discuss cryo-EM: a leading technology to constitute the spatial structure of biological molecules, which serves as our prime motivation. In particular, we derive explicit bounds for recovering a molecular structure from the second moment under a semi-algebraic prior and deduce information-theoretic implications. We also obtain information-theoretic bounds for three additional applications: factoring Gram matrices, multi-reference alignment, and phase retrieval. Finally, we deduce bounds for designing permutation invariant separators in machine learning.">

The need to go beyond Machine Learning (ML) strategies is driven by: (i) limited volume of informative data, (ii) avoiding accurate-but-wrong predictions; (iii) dealing with uncertainties; (iv) providing Explainable and Interpretable inferences. A general definition of PEML is provided by considering four physics and domain knowledge biases, and three broad groups of PEML approaches are discussed: physics-guided, physics-encoded and physics-informed. The advantages and challenges in developing PEML strategies for guiding high-consequence decision making in engineering applications involving complex dynamical systems, are presented.">

        <tr id="In chaos control, one usually seeks to stabilize the unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) that densely inhabit the attractors of many chaotic dynamical systems. These orbits collectively play a significant role in determining the dynamics and properties of chaotic systems and are said to form the skeleton of the associated attractors. While UPOs are insightful tools for analysis, they are naturally unstable and, as such, are difficult to find and computationally expensive to stabilize. An alternative to using UPOs is to approximate them using cupolets. Cupolets, a name derived from chaotic, unstable, periodic, orbit-lets, are a relatively new class of waveforms that represent highly accurate approximations to the UPOs of chaotic systems, but which are generated via a particular control scheme that applies tiny perturbations along Poincaré sections. Originally discovered in an application of secure chaotic communications, cupolets have since gone on to play pivotal roles in a number of theoretical and practical applications. These developments include using cupolets as wavelets for image compression, targeting in dynamical systems, a chaotic analog to quantum entanglement, an abstract reducibility classification, a basis for audio and video compression, and, most recently, their detection in a chaotic neuron model. This review will detail the historical development of cupolets, how they are generated, and their successful integration into theoretical and computational science and will also identify some unanswered questions and future directions for this work.">

The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries. These results highlight the unique generalization capability of the proposed operator learning approach.">

However, for highly nonlinear real-world applications like aerospace composites processing, existing models often fail to capture underlying solutions accurately and are typically limited to single input functions, constraining rapid process design development. This paper introduces an advanced physics-informed DeepONet tailored for such complex systems with multiple input functions. Equipped with architectural enhancements like nonlinear decoders and effective training strategies such as curriculum learning and domain decomposition, the proposed model handles high-dimensional design spaces with significantly improved accuracy, outperforming the vanilla physics-informed DeepONet by two orders of magnitude. Its zero-shot prediction capability across a broad design space makes it a powerful tool for accelerating composites process design and optimization, with potential applications in other engineering fields characterized by strong nonlinearity.">

Hitherto, it has been separately addressed by employing operator learning surrogates for field prediction while using simulation-based inference (and its variants) for statistical parameter determination. Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.">

        <tr id="Of all the vector fields surrounding the minima of recurrent learning setups, the gradient field with its exploding and vanishing updates appears a poor choice for optimization, offering little beyond efficient computability. We seek to improve this suboptimal practice in the context of physics simulations, where backpropagating feedback through many unrolled time steps is considered crucial to acquiring temporally coherent behavior. The alternative vector field we propose follows from two principles: physics simulators, unlike neural networks, have a balanced gradient flow, and certain modifications to the backpropagation pass leave the positions of the original minima unchanged. As any modification of backpropagation decouples forward and backward pass, the rotation-free character of the gradient field is lost. Therefore, we discuss the negative implications of using such a rotational vector field for optimization and how to counteract them. Our final procedure is easily implementable via a sequence of gradient stopping and component-wise comparison operations, which do not negatively affect scalability. Our experiments on three control problems show that especially as we increase the complexity of each task, the unbalanced updates from the gradient can no longer provide the precise control signals necessary while our method still solves the tasks.

        <tr id="In this paper, we present a data-driven model predictive control (DDMPC) framework specifically designed for constrained single-input single-output (SISO) nonlinear systems. Our approach involves customizing a set-theoretic receding horizon controller within a data-driven context. To achieve this, we translate model-based conditions into data series of available input and output signals. This translation process leverages recent advances in data-driven control theory, enabling the controller to operate effectively without relying on explicit system models. The proposed framework incorporates a robust methodology for managing system constraints, ensuring that the control actions remain within predefined bounds. By means of time sequences, the controller learns the underlying system dynamics and adapts to changes in real time, providing enhanced performance and reliability. The integration of set-theoretic methods allows for the systematic handling of uncertainties and disturbances, which are common when the trajectory of a nonlinear system is embedded inside a linear trajectory state tube. To validate the effectiveness of our DDMPC framework, we conduct extensive simulations on a nonlinear DC motor system. The results demonstrate significant improvements in control performance, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of our approach compared to traditional model-based MPC techniques.">

        <tr id="On the forefront of scientific computing, Deep Learning (DL), i.e., machine learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has emerged a powerful new tool for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

        <tr id="We developed a novel reservoir characterization workflow that addresses reservoir history matching by coupling a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) forward model with a mixture of experts' approach, termed cluster classify regress (CCR). The inverse modelling is achieved via an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman inversion (aREKI) method, ideal for rapid inverse uncertainty quantification during history matching. We parametrize unknown permeability and porosity fields for non-Gaussian posterior measures using a variational convolution autoencoder and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) exotic priors. The CCR works as a supervised model with the PINO surrogate to replicate nonlinear Peaceman well equations. The CCR's flexibility allows any independent machine-learning algorithm for each stage. The PINO reservoir surrogate's loss function is derived from supervised data loss and losses from the initial conditions and residual of the governing black oil PDE. The PINO-CCR surrogate outputs pressure, water, and gas saturations, along with oil, water, and gas production rates. The methodology was compared to a standard numerical black oil simulator for a waterflooding case on the Norne field, showing similar outputs. This PINO-CCR surrogate was then used in the aREKI history matching workflow, successfully recovering the unknown permeability, porosity and fault multiplier, with simulations up to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. Training the PINO-CCR surrogate on an NVIDIA H100 with 80G memory takes about 5 hours for 100 samples of the Norne field. This workflow is suitable for ensemble-based approaches, where posterior density sampling, given an expensive likelihood evaluation, is desirable for uncertainty quantification.">

Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. The DeepOKAN is used to develop surrogates for different mechanics problems.

        <tr id="The $L^2$ gradient flow of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional leads to the Allen Cahn equation that is widely used for modeling phase separation. Machine learning methods for solving the Allen-Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives through automatic differentiation, and the large system size required by the space-time approach. To overcome these limitations, we propose a separable neural network-based approximation of the phase field in a minimizing movement scheme to solve the aforementioned gradient flow problem. At each time step, the separable neural network is used to approximate the phase field in space through a low-rank tensor decomposition thereby accelerating the derivative calculations. The minimizing movement scheme naturally allows for the use of Gauss quadrature technique to compute the functional. A `$tanh$' transformation is applied on the neural network-predicted phase field to strictly bounds the solutions within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, a theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that bounding the solution through this transformation is the key to effectively model sharp interfaces through separable neural network. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for phase separation problems and is an order of magnitude faster than the finite element method.">

        <tr id="Using neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) is gaining popularity as an alternative approach in the scientific computing community. Neural networks can integrate different types of information into the loss function. These include observation data, governing equations, and variational forms, etc. These loss functions can be broadly categorized into two types: observation data loss directly constrains and measures the model output, while other loss functions indirectly model the performance of the network, which can be classified as model loss. However, this alternative approach lacks a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms, including theoretical foundations and rigorous characterization of various phenomena. This work focuses on investigating how different loss functions impact the training of neural networks for solving PDEs. We discover a stable loss-jump phenomenon: when switching the loss function from the data loss to the model loss, which includes different orders of derivative information, the neural network solution significantly deviates from the exact solution immediately. Further experiments reveal that this phenomenon arises from the different frequency preferences of neural networks under different loss functions. We theoretically analyze the frequency preference of neural networks under model loss. This loss-jump phenomenon provides a valuable perspective for examining the underlying mechanisms of neural networks in solving PDEs.">

Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

        <tr id="Neural Ordinary Differential Equations typically struggle to generalize to new dynamical behaviors created by parameter changes in the underlying system, even when the dynamics are close to previously seen behaviors. The issue gets worse when the changing parameters are unobserved, i.e., their value or influence is not directly measurable when collecting data. We introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a framework that encodes said unobserved parameters in a latent context vector as input to a vector field. NCFs leverage differentiability of the vector field with respect to the parameters, along with first-order Taylor expansion to allow any context vector to influence trajectories from other parameters. We validate our method and compare it to established Multi-Task and Meta-Learning alternatives, showing competitive performance in mean squared error for in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluation on the Lotka-Volterra, Glycolytic Oscillator, and Gray-Scott problems. This study holds practical implications for foundational models in science and related areas that benefit from conditional neural ODEs.

        <tr id="We develop a Mean-Field (MF) view of the learning dynamics of overparametrized Artificial Neural Networks (NN) under data symmetric in law wrt the action of a general compact group $G$. We consider for this a class of generalized shallow NNs given by an ensemble of $N$ multi-layer units, jointly trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and possibly symmetry-leveraging (SL) techniques, such as Data Augmentation (DA), Feature Averaging (FA) or Equivariant Architectures (EA). We introduce the notions of weakly and strongly invariant laws (WI and SI) on the parameter space of each single unit, corresponding, respectively, to $G$-invariant distributions, and to distributions supported on parameters fixed by the group action (which encode EA). This allows us to define symmetric models compatible with taking $N\to\infty$ and give an interpretation of the asymptotic dynamics of DA, FA and EA in terms of Wasserstein Gradient Flows describing their MF limits. When activations respect the group action, we show that, for symmetric data, DA, FA and freely-trained models obey the exact same MF dynamic, which stays in the space of WI laws and minimizes therein the population risk. We also give a counterexample to the general attainability of an optimum over SI laws. Despite this, quite remarkably, we show that the set of SI laws is also preserved by the MF dynamics even when freely trained. This sharply contrasts the finite-$N$ setting, in which EAs are generally not preserved by unconstrained SGD. We illustrate the validity of our findings as $N$ gets larger in a teacher-student experimental setting, training a student NN to learn from a WI, SI or arbitrary teacher model through various SL schemes. We last deduce a data-driven heuristic to discover the largest subspace of parameters supporting SI distributions for a problem, that could be used for designing EA with minimal generalization error.">

        <tr id="Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results, but the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we advocate an alternative view-point that sheds light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V.\;Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model enables a deep connection between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representation theory of Lie algebras as pursued in quantum theory. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. The transferal of outcomes, from finite-dimensional matrices to infinite-dimensional fluids, is then supported by hard-fought results in quantization theory -- the field which describes the limit between quantum and classical physics. We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.">

        <tr id="Recently, a superdiffusion exhibiting the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling in late-time correlators and autocorrelators of certain interacting many-body systems has been reported. Inspired by these results, we explore the KPZ scaling in correlation functions using their realization in the Krylov operator basis. We focus on the Heisenberg time scale, which approximately corresponds to the ramp--plateau transition for the Krylov complexity in systems with a large but finite number degrees of freedom. Two frameworks are under consideration: i) the system with growing Lanczos coefficients and an artificial cut-off, and ii) the system with the finite Hilbert space. In both cases via numerical analysis, we observe the transition from Gaussian to KPZ-like scaling at the critical Euclidean time $t_{E}^*=c_{cr}K$, for the Krylov chain of finite length $K$, and $c_{cr}=O(1)$. In particular, we find a scaling $\sim K^{1/3}$ for fluctuations in the one-point correlation function and a dynamical scaling $\sim K^{-2/3}$ associated with the return probability (Loschmidt echo) corresponding to autocorrelators in physical space. In the first case, the transition is of the 3rd order and can be considered as an example of dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), while in the second, it is a crossover. For case ii), utilizing the relationship between the spectrum of tridiagonal matrices at the spectral edge and the spectrum of the stochastic Airy operator, we demonstrate analytically the origin of the KPZ scaling for the particular Krylov chain using the results of the probability theory. We argue that there is some outcome of our study for the double scaling limit of matrix models. For the case of topological gravity, the white noise $O(\frac{1}{N})$ term is identified, which should be taken into account in the controversial issue of ensemble averaging in 2D/1D holography.">

        <tr id="In this article, we investigate the implications of the unsupervised learning rule known as Input-Correlations (ICO) learning in the nonlinear dynamics of two linearly coupled PT-symmetric Li\'enard oscillators. The fixed points of the oscillator have been evaluated analytically and the Jacobian linearization is employed to study their stability. We find that on increasing the amplitude of the external periodic drive, the system exhibits period-doubling cascade to chaos within a specific parametric regime wherein we observe emergent chaotic dynamics. We further notice that the system indicates an intermittency route to chaos in the chaotic regime. Finally, in the period-4 regime of our bifurcation analysis, we predict the emergence of transient chaos which eventually settles down to a period-2 oscillator response which has been further validated by both the maximal Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) using the well-known Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique and the Hilbert Transform of the time-series. In the transiently chaotic regime, we deploy the ICO learning to analyze the time-series from which we identify that when the chaotic evolution transforms into periodic dynamics, the synaptic weight associated with the time-series of the loss oscillator exhibits stationary temporal evolution. This signifies that in the periodic regime, there is no overlap between the filtered signals obtained from the time-series of the coupled PT-symmetric oscillators. In addition, the temporal evolution of the weight associated with the stimulus mimics the behaviour of the Hilbert transform of the time-series.">

        <tr id="Data assimilation aims to estimate the states of a dynamical system by optimally combining sparse and noisy observations of the physical system with uncertain forecasts produced by a computational model. The states of many dynamical systems of interest obey nonlinear physical constraints, and the corresponding dynamics is confined to a certain sub-manifold of the state space. Standard data assimilation techniques applied to such systems yield posterior states lying outside the manifold, violating the physical constraints. This work focuses on particle flow filters which use stochastic differential equations to evolve state samples from a prior distribution to samples from an observation-informed posterior distribution. The variational Fokker-Planck (VFP) -- a generic particle flow filtering framework -- is extended to incorporate non-linear, equality state constraints in the analysis. To this end, two algorithmic approaches that modify the VFP stochastic differential equation are discussed: (i) VFPSTAB, to inexactly preserve constraints with the addition of a stabilizing drift term, and (ii) VFPDAE, to exactly preserve constraints by treating the VFP dynamics as a stochastic differential-algebraic equation (SDAE). Additionally, an implicit-explicit time integrator is developed to evolve the VFPDAE dynamics. The strength of the proposed approach for constraint preservation in data assimilation is demonstrated on three test problems: the double pendulum, Korteweg-de-Vries, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.">

Recently, the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been introduced as one of the most promising tools to solve systems of differential equations guided by some physically grounded constraints. In the quantum realm, such approach paves the way to a novel approach to solve the Schroedinger equation for non-integrable systems. By following an unsupervised learning approach, we apply the PINNs to the anharmonic oscillator in which an interaction term proportional to the fourth power of the position coordinate is present. We compute the eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions while varying the weight of the quartic interaction. We bridge our solutions to the regime where both the perturbative and the strong coupling theory work, including the pure quartic oscillator.

        <tr id="We present both a theoretical and a methodological framework that addresses a critical challenge in applying deep learning to physical systems: the reconciliation of non-linear expressiveness with SO(3)-equivariance in predictions of SO(3)-equivariant quantities. Inspired by covariant theory in physics, we address this problem by exploring the mathematical relationships between SO(3)-invariant and SO(3)-equivariant quantities and their representations. We first construct theoretical SO(3)-invariant quantities derived from the SO(3)-equivariant regression targets, and use these invariant quantities as supervisory labels to guide the learning of high-quality SO(3)-invariant features. Given that SO(3)-invariance is preserved under non-linear operations, the encoding process for invariant features can extensively utilize non-linear mappings, thereby fully capturing the non-linear patterns inherent in physical systems. Building on this foundation, we propose a gradient-based mechanism to induce SO(3)-equivariant encodings of various degrees from the learned SO(3)-invariant features. This mechanism can incorporate non-linear expressive capabilities into SO(3)-equivariant representations, while theoretically preserving their equivariant properties as we prove. We apply our theory and method to the electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction tasks, experimental results on eight benchmark databases covering multiple types of elements and challenging scenarios show dramatic breakthroughs on the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, with improvements of up to 40% in predicting Hamiltonians and up to 76% in predicting downstream physical quantities such as occupied orbital energy. Our approach goes beyond handling physical systems and offers a promising general solution to the critical dilemma between equivariance and non-linear expressiveness for the deep learning paradigm.">

 We present a tensor-based method for model selection which identifies the unknown partial differential equation that governs a dynamical system using only spatiotemporal measurements. The method circumvents a disadvantage of standard matrix-based methods which typically have large storage consumption. Using a recently developed multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems, we collect the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the measured data and construct a low-rank dictionary tensor in the tensor-train format. A tensor-based linear regression problem is then built, which balances the learning accuracy, model complexity, and computational efficiency. An algebraic expression of the unknown equations can be extracted. Numerical results are demonstrated on datasets generated by the wave equation, the Burgers' equation, and a few parametric partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

First, we introduce a method to extend an existing known model with an uncertainty model so that stability of the extended model is guaranteed in the sense of set invariance and input-to-state stability. To achieve this, we provide two tractable semi-definite programs. These programs allow obtaining optimal uncertainty model parameters for both locally and globally Lipschitz nonlinear models, given uncertainty and state trajectories. Subsequently, in order to extract this data from the available input-output trajectories, we introduce a filter that incorporates an approximated internal model of the uncertainty and asymptotically estimates uncertainty and state realizations. This filter is also synthesized using semi-definite programs with guaranteed robustness with respect to uncertainty model mismatches, disturbances, and noise. Numerical simulations for a large data-set of a roll plane model of a vehicle illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed methodology in improving model accuracy, while guaranteeing stability.">

We then compare these to gated recurrent models, and show that the latter exhibit more topological complexity, with a distinct pattern of changes common to all natural languages but absent from synthetically generated data. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the representation manifolds derived by these models based on studying the shapes of vector clouds induced by them as they are conditioned on sentences from corpora of natural language text. The methods developed in this paper are novel in the field and based on mathematical apparatus that might be unfamiliar to the target audience. To help with that we introduce the minimum necessary theory, and provide additional visualizations in the appendices. The main contribution of the paper is a striking observation about the topological structure of the transformer as compared to LSTM based neural architectures. It suggests that further research into mathematical properties of these neural networks is necessary to understand the operation of large transformer language models. We hope this work inspires further explorations in this direction within the NLP community.">

        <tr id="The dynamics of flexible filaments entrained in flow, important for understanding many biological and industrial processes, are computationally expensive to model with full-physics simulations. This work describes a data-driven technique to create high-fidelity low-dimensional models of flexible fiber dynamics using machine learning; the technique is applied to sedimentation in a quiescent, viscous Newtonian fluid, using results from detailed simulations as the data set. The approach combines an autoencoder neural network architecture to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the filament shape, with a neural ODE that learns the evolution of the particle in the latent state. The model was designed to model filaments of varying flexibility, characterized by an elasto-gravitational number $\mathcal{B}$, and was trained on a data set containing the evolution of fibers beginning at set angles of inclination. For the range of $\mathcal{B}$ considered here (100-10000), the filament shape dynamics can be represented with high accuracy with only four degrees of freedom, in contrast to the 93 present in the original bead-spring model used to generate the dynamic trajectories. We predict the evolution of fibers set at arbitrary angles and demonstrate that our data-driven model can accurately forecast the evolution of a fiber at both trained and untrained elasto-gravitational numbers.">

        <tr id="In the context of model-based control of industrial processes, it is a common practice to develop a data-driven linear dynamical model around a specified operating point. However, in applications involving wider operating conditions, representation of the dynamics using a single linear dynamic model is often inadequate, requiring either a nonlinear model or multiple linear models to accommodate the nonlinear behaviour. While the development of the former suffers from the requirements of extensive experiments spanning multiple levels, significant compromise in the nominal product quality and dealing with unmeasured disturbances over wider operating conditions, the latter faces the challenge of model switch scheduling and inadequate description of dynamics for the operating regions in-between. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient approach to obtain a parsimonious nonlinear dynamic model by developing multiple linear models from data at multiple operating points, lifting the data features obtained from individual model simulations to adequately accommodate the underlying nonlinear behaviour and finally, sparse optimization techniques to obtain a parsimonious model. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulation case studies.">

Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed trial-to-trial variability.">

        <tr id="Multi-index models -- functions which only depend on the covariates through a non-linear transformation of their projection on a subspace -- are a useful benchmark for investigating feature learning with neural networks. This paper examines the theoretical boundaries of learnability in this hypothesis class, focusing particularly on the minimum sample complexity required for weakly recovering their low-dimensional structure with first-order iterative algorithms, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples is $n=\alpha d$ is proportional to the covariate dimension $d$. Our findings unfold in three parts: (i) first, we identify under which conditions a \textit{trivial subspace} can be learned with a single step of a first-order algorithm for any $\alpha\!>\!0$; (ii) second, in the case where the trivial subspace is empty, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an {\it easy subspace} consisting of directions that can be learned only above a certain sample complexity $\alpha\!>\!\alpha_c$. The critical threshold $\alpha_{c}$ marks the presence of a computational phase transition, in the sense that no efficient iterative algorithm can succeed for $\alpha\!<\!\alpha_c$. In a limited but interesting set of really hard directions -- akin to the parity problem -- $\alpha_c$ is found to diverge. Finally, (iii) we demonstrate that interactions between different directions can result in an intricate hierarchical learning phenomenon, where some directions can be learned sequentially when coupled to easier ones. Our analytical approach is built on the optimality of approximate message-passing algorithms among first-order iterative methods, delineating the fundamental learnability limit across a broad spectrum of algorithms, including neural networks trained with gradient descent.">

        <tr id="Using equilibrium fluctuations to understand the response of a physical system to an externally imposed perturbation is the basis for linear response theory, which is widely used to interpret experiments and shed light on microscopic dynamics. For nonequilibrium systems, perturbations cannot be interpreted simply by monitoring fluctuations in a conjugate observable -- additional dynamical information is needed. The theory of linear response around nonequilibrium steady states relies on path ensemble averaging, which makes this theory inapplicable to perturbations that affect the diffusion constant or temperature in a stochastic system. Here, we show that a separate, ``effective'' physical process can be used to describe the perturbed dynamics and that this dynamics in turn allows us to accurately calculate the response to a change in the diffusion. Interestingly, the effective dynamics contains an additional drift that is proportional to the ``score'' of the instantaneous probability density of the system -- this object has also been studied extensively in recent years in the context of denoising diffusion models in the machine learning literature. Exploiting recently developed algorithms for learning the score, we show that we can carry out nonequilibrium response calculations on systems for which the exact score cannot be obtained.">

When modeling densities on manifolds, NFs can be generalized to injective flows but the Jacobian determinant becomes computationally prohibitive. Current approaches either consider bounds on the log-likelihood or rely on some approximations of the Jacobian determinant. In contrast, we propose injective flows for parametric hypersurfaces and show that for such manifolds we can compute the Jacobian determinant exactly and efficiently, with the same cost as NFs. Furthermore, we show that for the subclass of star-like manifolds we can extend the proposed framework to always allow for a Cartesian representation of the density. We showcase the relevance of modeling densities on hypersurfaces in two settings. Firstly, we introduce a novel Objective Bayesian approach to penalized likelihood models by interpreting level-sets of the penalty as star-like manifolds. Secondly, we consider Bayesian mixture models and introduce a general method for variational inference by defining the posterior of mixture weights on the probability simplex.">

End-to-end machine learning approaches to inverse problems typically require constructing sophisticated estimators to achieve the desired accuracy, largely because they need to learn the complex underlying physical model. Here, we discuss an alternative paradigm: by making the physical model auto-differentiable we can construct a neural surrogate to represent the unknown physical quantity sought, while avoiding having to relearn the known physics entirely. We dub this process surrogate training embedded in physics (STEP) and illustrate that it generalizes well and is robust against overfitting and significant noise in the data. We demonstrate how STEP can be applied to perform dynamic kernel deconvolution to analyse resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra and show that surprisingly simple estimator architectures suffice to extract the relevant physical information.">

The setting we consider involves a collection of $m$ linear systems each of which resides on a node of a given undirected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$. We assume that the system matrices are marginally stable, and satisfy a smoothness constraint w.r.t $G$ -- akin to the quadratic variation of a signal on a graph. Given access to the states of the nodes over $T$ time points, we then propose two estimators for joint estimation of the system matrices, along with non-asymptotic error bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE). In particular, we show conditions under which the MSE converges to zero as $m$ increases, typically polynomially fast w.r.t $m$. The results hold under mild (i.e., $T \sim \log m$), or sometimes, even no assumption on $T$ (i.e. $T \geq 2$).">

A fundamental requirement is the existence of a unique set of parameters for a chosen model structure, an issue commonly referred to as identifiability. Although this problem is well studied for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), few studies have focused on the more general class of systems described by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Examples of DAEs include dynamical systems with algebraic equations representing conservation laws or approximating fast dynamics. This work introduces a novel identifiability test for models characterized by nonlinear DAEs. Unlike previous approaches, our test only requires prior knowledge of the system equations and does not need nonlinear transformation, index reduction, or numerical integration of the DAEs. We employed our identifiability analysis across a diverse range of DAE models, illustrating how system identifiability depends on the choices of sensors, experimental conditions, and model structures. Given the added challenges involved in identifying DAEs when compared to ODEs, we anticipate that our findings will have broad applicability and contribute significantly to the development and validation of data-driven methods for DAEs and other structure-preserving models.">

Although traditional variational methods have achieved great success and have been widely used in many numerical weather prediction centers, they generally assume Gaussian errors in the background states, which limits the accuracy of these algorithms due to the inherent inaccuracies of this assumption. In this paper, we introduce VAE-Var, a novel variational algorithm that leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model a non-Gaussian estimate of the background error distribution. We theoretically derive the variational cost under the VAE estimation and present the general formulation of VAE-Var; we implement VAE-Var on low-dimensional chaotic systems and demonstrate through experimental results that VAE-Var consistently outperforms traditional variational assimilation methods in terms of accuracy across various observational settings.">

Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

At the core of our approach is a novel dynamical graph neural network designed to handle the complexities associated with tracking accurately upstream points along characteristics. This proposed neural transport solver learns the conservative SL FD discretization directly from data, improving accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional numerical schemes, while significantly simplifying algorithm implementation.

There are two types of manifold learning approaches: linear and nonlinear. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) are two examples of linear techniques that have long been staples in the statistician's arsenal for evaluating multivariate data. Nonlinear manifold learning, which encompasses diffusion maps, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Hessian Eigenmaps, Isomap, and local linear embedding, has seen a surge in research effort recently. A few of these methods are nonlinear extensions of linear approaches. A nearest search, the definition of distances or affinities between points (a crucial component of these methods' effectiveness), and an Eigen problem for embedding high-dimensional points into a lower dimensional space make up the algorithmic process of the majority of these techniques. The strengths and weaknesses of the new method are briefly reviewed in this article.

However, despite their significant success in various fields, it remains unclear in many aspects how to effectively train PINNs if the solutions of PDEs exhibit stiff behaviors or high frequencies. In this paper, we propose a new method for training PINNs using variable-scaling techniques. This method is simple and it can be applied to a wide range of problems including PDEs with rapidly-varying solutions. Throughout various numerical experiments, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for these problems and confirm that it can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of PINNs. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we will provide theoretical evidence for this phenomenon and show that our methods can indeed improve the performance of PINNs.">

We show how to extend this characterization to other linear algebraic groups, including the Lorentz and symplectic groups. Our goal behind these characterizations is to define equivariant machine learning models. In particular, we focus on the sparse vector estimation problem. This problem has been broadly studied in the theoretical computer science literature, and explicit spectral methods, derived by techniques from sum-of-squares, can be shown to recover sparse vectors under certain assumptions. Our numerical results show that the proposed equivariant machine learning models can learn spectral methods that outperform the best theoretically known spectral methods in some regimes. The experiments also suggest that learned spectral methods can solve the problem in settings that have not yet been theoretically analyzed. This is an example of a promising direction in which theory can inform machine learning models and machine learning models could inform theory.">

This, however, drastically changes whenever non-smooth phenomena enter the scene such as for problems at low regularity and high oscillations. Classical schemes fail to capture the oscillatory nature of the solution, and this may lead to severe instabilities and loss of convergence. In this article we review a new class of resonance-based schemes. The key idea in the construction of the new schemes is to tackle and deeply embed the underlying nonlinear structure of resonances into the numerical discretization.

This paper employs a greedy sampling approach based on the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method to identify the most informative samples in a dataset associated with a partial differential equation to estimate its parameters. Greedy samples are used to train a physics-informed neural network architecture which maps the nonlinear relation between spatio-temporal data and the measured values. To prove the impact of greedy samples on the training of the physics-informed neural network for parameter estimation of a partial differential equation, their performance is compared with random samples taken from the given dataset. Our simulation results show that for all considered partial differential equations, greedy samples outperform random samples, i.e., we can estimate parameters with a significantly lower number of samples while simultaneously reducing the relative estimation error. A Python package is also prepared to support different phases of the proposed algorithm, including data prepossessing, greedy sampling, neural network training, and comparison.">

Although the McMillan e-lens has been considered as a device potentially capable of mitigating collective space charge forces, some of its fundamental properties have not been described yet. The main goal of our work is to close this gap and understand the limitations and potentials of this device. It is worth mentioning that the McMillan axially symmetric map provides the first-order approximations of dynamics for a general linear lattice plus an arbitrary thin lens with motion separable in polar coordinates. Therefore, advancements in its understanding should give us a better picture of more generic and not necessarily integrable round beams. In the first part of the article, we classify all possible regimes with stable trajectories and find the canonical action-angle variables. This provides an evaluation of the dynamical aperture, Poincar\'e rotation numbers as functions of amplitudes, and thus determines the spread in nonlinear tunes. Also, we provide a parameterization of invariant curves, allowing for the immediate determination of the map image forward and backward in time. The second part investigates the particle dynamics as a function of system parameters. We show that there are three fundamentally different configurations of the accelerator optics causing different regimes of nonlinear oscillations. Each regime is considered in great detail, including the limiting cases of large and small amplitudes. In addition, we analyze the dynamics in Cartesian coordinates and provide a description of observable variables and corresponding spectra.">

Traditional machine learning methods have advanced our ability to learn and predict such systems from observed time series data. However, predicting the behavior of systems with temporal parameter variations without knowledge of true parameter values remains a significant challenge. This study leverages the reservoir computing framework to address this problem by unsupervised extraction of slowly varying system parameters from time series data. We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data. Our approach shows potential for applications in fields such as neuroscience, material science, and weather prediction, where slow dynamics influencing qualitative changes are often unobservable.">

Following that, the feature space is bisected into multiple partitions based on the variation of the Shannon entropy under the maximum entropy (ME) bisecting process. The behavior of subsystems in the prespecified state space partitions will then be approximated using a group of shallow neural networks (SNNs) known as extreme learning machines (ELMs), and then it can further simplify the model by merging the redundant lattices based on their training error performance. The proposed modeling framework can handle high-dimensional dynamical system modeling problems with the advantages of reducing model complexity and improving model performance in training and verification.

Precise theoretical guarantees are provided for a class of Gaussian matrices and non-separable denoising functions. Specifically, it is shown that the iterates can be well-approximated in the high-dimensional limit by a Gaussian process whose second-order statistics are defined recursively via state evolution.

In such scenarios, the operators map between Banach or Hilbert spaces. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning operators between Banach spaces, in contrast to the vast majority of past works considering only Hilbert spaces. We focus on learning holomorphic operators - an important class of problems with many applications. We combine arbitrary approximate encoders and decoders with standard feedforward Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures - specifically, those with constant width exceeding the depth - under standard $\ell^2$-loss minimization. We first identify a family of DNNs such that the resulting Deep Learning (DL) procedure achieves optimal generalization bounds for such operators. For standard fully-connected architectures, we then show that there are uncountably many minimizers of the training problem that yield equivalent optimal performance. The DNN architectures we consider are `problem agnostic', with width and depth only depending on the amount of training data $m$ and not on regularity assumptions of the target operator. Next, we show that DL is optimal for this problem: no recovery procedure can surpass these generalization bounds up to log terms. Finally, we present numerical results demonstrating the practical performance on challenging problems including the parametric diffusion, Navier-Stokes-Brinkman and Boussinesq PDEs.">

Unlike images, graphs do not have a natural notion of domain translation. Therefore, we consider the graph functional shifts as the symmetry group: the unitary operators that commute with the graph shift operator. Notably, such symmetries operate in the signal space rather than directly in the spatial space. We remark that each linear filter layer of a standard spectral graph neural network (GNN) commutes with graph functional shifts, but the activation function breaks this symmetry. Instead, we propose nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) that are fully equivariant to graph functional shifts and show that they have universal approximation properties. The proposed NLSFs are based on a new form of spectral domain that is transferable between graphs. We demonstrate the superior performance of NLSFs over existing spectral GNNs in node and graph classification benchmarks.">

        <tr id="In chaotic dynamical systems, extreme events manifest in time series as unpredictable large-amplitude peaks. Although deterministic, extreme events appear seemingly randomly, which makes their forecasting difficult. By learning the dynamics from observables (data), reservoir computers can time-accurately predict extreme events and chaotic dynamics, but they may require many degrees of freedom (large reservoirs). In this paper, by exploiting quantum-computer ans\"atze and entanglement, we design reservoir computers with compact reservoirs and accurate prediction capabilities. First, we propose the recurrence-free quantum reservoir computer (RF-QRC) architecture. By developing ad-hoc quantum feature maps and removing recurrent connections, the RF-QRC has quantum circuits with small depths. This allows the RF-QRC to scale well with higher-dimensional chaotic systems, which makes it suitable for hardware implementation. Second, we forecast the temporal chaotic dynamics and their long-term statistics of low- and higher-dimensional dynamical systems. We find that RF-QRC requires smaller reservoirs than classical reservoir computers. Third, we apply the RF-QRC to the time prediction of extreme events in a model of a turbulent shear flow with turbulent bursts. We find that the RF-QRC has a longer predictability than the classical reservoir computer. The results and analyses indicate that quantum-computer ans\"atze offer nonlinear expressivity and computational scalability, which are useful for forecasting chaotic dynamics and extreme events. This work opens new opportunities for using quantum machine learning on near-term quantum computers.">

We introduce a new method to learn low-dimensional representations of nonlinear time series without supervision and can have provable recovery guarantees. The learned representation can be used for downstream machine-learning tasks such as clustering and classification. The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality. We show the competitive performance of our method on real-world time-series data with the baselines and demonstrate its effectiveness for symbolic text modeling and RNA sequence clustering.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse domains, becoming the state-of-the-art solution for addressing sequential machine learning problems. Even though we have a general understanding of the fundamental components in the transformer architecture, little is known about how they operate or what are their expected dynamics. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the relationship between attention mechanisms and Hopfield networks, promising to shed light on the statistical physics of transformer networks. However, to date, the dynamical regimes of transformer-like models have not been studied in depth. In this paper, we address this gap by using methods for the study of asymmetric Hopfield networks in nonequilibrium regimes --namely path integral methods over generating functionals, yielding dynamics governed by concurrent mean-field variables. Assuming 1-bit tokens and weights, we derive analytical approximations for the behavior of large self-attention neural networks coupled to a softmax output, which become exact in the large limit size. Our findings reveal nontrivial dynamical phenomena, including nonequilibrium phase transitions associated with chaotic bifurcations, even for very simple configurations with a few encoded features and a very short context window. Finally, we discuss the potential of our analytic approach to improve our understanding of the inner workings of transformer models, potentially reducing computational training costs and enhancing model interpretability.">

This technique, referred to as the Laplace Transform Reduced Basis (LT-RB) method, uses two widely known mathematical tools to construct a fast and efficient method for the solution of linear, time-dependent problems: The Laplace transform and the Reduced Basis method, hence the name. The application of the Laplace transform yields a time-independent problem parametrically depending on the Laplace variable. Following the two-phase paradigm of the RB method, firstly in an offline stage we sample the Laplace parameter, compute the full-order or high-fidelity solution, and then resort to a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to extract a basis of reduced dimension. Then, in an online phase, we project the time-dependent problem onto this basis and proceed to solve the evolution problem using any suitable time-stepping method. We prove exponential convergence of the reduced solution computed by the LT-RB method toward the high-fidelity one as the dimension of the reduced space increases. Finally, we present a set of numerical experiments portraying the performance of the method in terms of accuracy and, in particular, speed-up when compared to the full-order model.">

By combining the methods of training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), we develop a model which has the expressivity of DNNs with the fine-tuning ability of ELMs. We showcase the superiority of our proposed method by solving several BVPs and IBVPs which include linear and non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs) and coupled PDEs. The examples we consider include a stiff coupled ODE system where traditional numerical methods fail, a 3+1D non-linear PDE, Kovasznay flow and Taylor-Green vortex solutions to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and pure advection solution of 1+1 D compressible Euler equation. The Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) is used to exactly impose initial and boundary conditions (IBCs) of (I)BVPs on PINNs. We propose a modification to the TFC framework named Reduced TFC and show a significant improvement in the training and inference time of PINNs compared to IBCs imposed using TFC. Furthermore, Reduced TFC is shown to be able to generalize to more complex boundary geometries which is not possible with TFC. We also introduce a method of applying boundary conditions at infinity for BVPs and numerically solve the pure advection in 1+1 D Euler equations using these boundary conditions.">

        <tr id="State estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems has long aimed to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The rapid evolution of various industries has amplified the demand for estimation frameworks that satisfy all these factors. This study introduces a neuromorphic approach for robust filtering of nonlinear dynamical systems: SNN-EMSIF (spiking neural network-extended modified sliding innovation filter). SNN-EMSIF combines the computational efficiency and scalability of SNNs with the robustness of EMSIF, an estimation framework designed for nonlinear systems with zero-mean Gaussian noise. Notably, the weight matrices are designed according to the system model, eliminating the need for a learning process. The framework's efficacy is evaluated through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing SNN-EMSIF with EKF and EMSIF. Additionally, it is compared with SNN-EKF in the presence of modeling uncertainties and neuron loss, using RMSEs as a metric. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of SNN-EMSIF. Further analysis of runtimes and spiking patterns reveals an impressive reduction of 85% in emitted spikes compared to possible spikes, highlighting the computational efficiency of SNN-EMSIF. This framework offers a promising solution for robust estimation in nonlinear dynamical systems, opening new avenues for efficient and reliable estimation in various industries that can benefit from neuromorphic computing.">

If these systems are Hamiltonian systems their physical structure should be preserved during the reduction, which can be ensured by applying symplectic basis generation techniques such as the complex SVD (cSVD). Recently, randomized symplectic methods such as the randomized complex singular value decomposition (rcSVD) have been developed for a more efficient computation of symplectic bases that preserve the Hamiltonian structure during MOR. In the current paper, we present two error bounds for the rcSVD basis depending on the choice of hyperparameters and show that with a proper choice of hyperparameters, the projection error of rcSVD is at most a constant factor worse than the projection error of cSVD. We provide numerical experiments that demonstrate the efficiency of randomized symplectic basis generation and compare the bounds numerically.">

SINDy is used to detect the system dynamics in the three well-known nonlinear systems. Analyzed are SINDy’s abilities to accurately represent transient/steady-state behaviour, noise effect, and model structure. A sparse set of basis functions can effectively capture the dynamics of a system, according to the data-driven approach known as SINDy. The coefficients of these basis functions are determined via methods of sparse regression, and the final model is made up of a number of sparse ordinary differential equations. The findings demonstrate that SINDy, with sufficient time-series data, can capture both transient and steady-state phenomena. According to the analysis of the noise effect, SINDy’s performance declines as the system’s noise level rises. The feature library must contain the appropriate model structure in order for SINDy to function effectively. SINDy has the potential to extract unknown system dynamics from experimental data.">

        <tr id="We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ where $n$ is the state space dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the $n$-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than $n$. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.">

With given correspondence between the spaces, SyncOT minimizes the aggregated cost of the dynamics induced across all considered spaces. The problem is discretized into a finite-dimensional convex problem using a staggered grid. Primal-dual algorithm-based approaches are then developed to solve the discretized problem.

Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos.

Existing work considers time-varying games or time-varying optimization problems. For strongly convex optimization problems or strongly monotone games, these results provide tracking guarantees under the assumption that the variation of the time-varying problem is restrained, that is, problems with a sublinear solution path. In this work we extend existing results in two ways: In our first result, we provide tracking bounds for (1) variational inequalities with a sublinear solution path but not necessarily monotone functions, and (2) for periodic time-varying variational inequalities that do not necessarily have a sublinear solution path-length. Our second main contribution is an extensive study of the convergence behavior and trajectory of discrete dynamical systems of periodic time-varying VI. We show that these systems can exhibit provably chaotic behavior or can converge to the solution. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results with experiments.">

        <tr id="Separating relevant and irrelevant information is key to any modeling process or scientific inquiry. Theoretical physics offers a powerful tool for achieving this in the form of the renormalization group (RG). Here we demonstrate a practical approach to performing Wilsonian RG in the context of Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the Gaussian Process in which the data plays the role of the energy scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and identify potential universality classes in these models.">

        <tr id="The finite parts of a large, locally interacting many-body system prepared out-of-equilibrium eventually equilibrate. Characterising the underlying mechanisms of this process and its timescales, however, is particularly hard as it requires to decouple universal features from observable-specific ones. Recently, new insight came by studying how certain symmetries of the dynamics that are broken by the initial state are restored at the level of the reduced state of a given subsystem. This provides a high level, observable-independent probe. Until now this idea has been applied to the restoration of internal symmetries, e.g. U(1) symmetries related to charge conservation. Here we show that that the same logic can be applied to the restoration of space-time symmetries, and hence can be used to characterise the relaxation of fully generic systems. We illustrate this idea by considering the paradigmatic example of"generic"many-body dynamics, i.e. a local random unitary circuit. We show that, surprisingly, the restoration of translation symmetry in these systems only happens on time-scales proportional to the subsystem's volume. In fact, for large enough subsystems the time of symmetry restoration becomes initial-state independent (as long as the latter breaks the symmetry at time zero) and coincides with the thermalisation time. For intermediate subsystems, however, one can observe the so-called"quantum Mpemba effect", where the state of the system restores a symmetry faster if it is initially more asymmetric.">

For example, classical fully-connected feed-forward NNs fail to approximate continuous functions whose gradient is discontinuous when employing strong formulations like in Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). In this article, we propose the use of regularity-conforming neural networks, where a priori information on the regularity of solutions to PDEs can be employed to construct proper architectures. We illustrate the potential of such architectures via a two-dimensional (2D) transmission problem, where the solution may admit discontinuities in the gradient across interfaces, as well as power-like singularities at certain points. In particular, we formulate the weak transmission problem in a PINNs-like strong formulation with interface and continuity conditions. Such architectures are partially explainable; discontinuities are explicitly described, allowing the introduction of novel terms into the loss function. We demonstrate via several model problems in one and two dimensions the advantages of using regularity-conforming architectures in contrast to classical architectures. The ideas presented in this article easily extend to problems in higher dimensions.">

Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems.

        <tr id="The precise simulation of turbulent flows is of immense importance in a variety of scientific and engineering fields, including climate science, freshwater science, and the development of energy-efficient manufacturing processes. Within the realm of turbulent flow simulation, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is widely considered to be the most reliable approach, but it is prohibitively expensive for long-term simulation at fine spatial scales. Given the pressing need for efficient simulation, there is an increasing interest in building machine learning models for turbulence, either by reconstructing DNS from alternative low-fidelity simulations or by predicting DNS based on the patterns learned from historical data. However, standard machine learning techniques remain limited in capturing complex spatio-temporal characteristics of turbulent flows, resulting in limited performance and generalizability. This paper presents a novel physics-enhanced neural operator (PENO) that incorporates physical knowledge of partial differential equations (PDEs) to accurately model flow dynamics. The model is further refined by a self-augmentation mechanism to reduce the accumulated error in long-term simulations. The proposed method is evaluated through its performance on two distinct sets of 3D turbulent flow data, showcasing the model's capability to reconstruct high-resolution DNS data, maintain the inherent physical properties of flow transport, and generate flow simulations across various resolutions. Additionally, experimental results on multiple 2D vorticity flow series, generated by different PDEs, highlight the transferability and generalizability of the proposed method. This confirms its applicability to a wide range of real-world scenarios in which extensive simulations are needed under diverse settings.">

        <tr id="Besides classical feed-forward neural networks, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated to a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps a linear transformation of the input to a linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points. These properties can be characterized via Morse functions, which are scalar functions, where every critical point is non-degenerate. We prove that critical points cannot exist, if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that each critical point is non-degenerate, if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and in the infinite depth case. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding, i.e.\ on the exact representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs. Our dynamical systems viewpoint on the geometric structure of the input-output map provides a fundamental understanding, why certain architectures perform better than others.">

In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data.

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

In this paper, we provide several novel contributions to the literature in this regard.

Second, using a probabilistic reformulation, we show that nonlocal derivatives are epsilon-sub gradients, and derive sample complexity results for convergence of stochastic gradient descent-like methods using nonlocal derivatives. Finally, using our analysis of the nonlocal gradient of Holder continuous functions, we observe that sample paths of Brownian motion admit nonlocal directional derivatives, and the nonlocal derivatives of Brownian motion are seen to be Gaussian processes with computable mean and standard deviation. Using the theory of nonlocal directional derivatives, we solve a highly nondifferentiable and nonconvex model problem of parameter estimation on image articulation manifolds. Using Brownian motion infused ReLU activation functions with the nonlocal gradient in place of the usual gradient during backpropagation, we also perform experiments on multiple well-studied deep learning architectures. Our experiments indicate the superior generalization capabilities of Brownian neural activation functions in low-training data regimes, where the use of stochastic neurons beats the deterministic ReLU counterpart.">

Two major types of model reduction methods for linear time-invariant dynamic systems are Krylov subspace-based methods and balanced truncation-based methods. The methods of the second type are much more theoretically sound than the first type in that there is a fairly tight global error bound on the approximation error between the original system and the reduced one. It is noted that the error bound is established based upon the availability of the exact controllability and observability Gramians. However, numerically, the Gramians are not available and have to be numerically calculated, and for a large scale system, a viable option is to compute low-rank approximations of the Gramians from which an approximate balanced truncation is then performed. Hence, rigorously speaking, the existing global error bound is not applicable to any reduced system obtained via approximate Gramians. The goal of this paper is to address this issue by establishing global error bounds for reduced systems via approximate balanced truncation.">

Extending the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, governing the first-order response probability density function (pdf), to this case is a complicated task calling for special treatment. In this work, a new pdf-evolution equation is derived for the response of nonlinear dynamical systems under additive colored Gaussian noise. The derivation is based on the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), transformed, by means of an extended version of the Novikov-Furutsu theorem, to an exact yet non-closed equation, involving averages over the history of the functional derivatives of the non-Markovian response with respect to the excitation. The latter are calculated exactly by means of the state-transition matrix of variational, time-varying systems. Subsequently, an approximation scheme is implemented, relying on a decomposition of the state-transition matrix in its instantaneous mean value and its fluctuation around it. By a current-time approximation to the latter, we obtain our final equation, in which the effect of the instantaneous mean value of the response is maintained, rendering it nonlinear and non-local in time. Numerical results for the response pdf are provided for a bistable Duffing oscillator, under Gaussian excitation. The pdfs obtained from the solution of the novel equation and a simpler small correlation time (SCT) pdf-evolution equation are compared to Monde Carlo (MC) simulations. The novel equation outperforms the SCT equation as the excitation correlation time increases, keeping good agreement with the MC simulations.">

Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.">

        <tr id="Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.">

However, classical neural network methods for solving nonlinear PDEs, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), Deep Ritz methods, and DeepONet, often encounter challenges when confronted with the presence of multiple solutions inherent in the nonlinear problem.

The process comprises the entire cycle of obtaining the data, training the predictive model, and delivering predictions to end-users within a single mathematical model. A distinctive feature of such repeated learning setting is that the state of the environment becomes causally dependent on the learner itself over time, thus violating the usual assumptions about the data distribution. We present a novel dynamical systems model of the repeated learning process and prove the limiting set of probability distributions for positive and negative feedback loop modes of the system operation. We conduct a series of computational experiments using an exemplary supervised learning problem on two synthetic data sets. The results of the experiments correspond to the theoretical predictions derived from the dynamical model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for studying the repeated learning processes in machine learning systems and open a range of opportunities for further research in the area.">

All of these solvers rely on random matrices to determine, e.g., starting vectors that have, with high probability, a non-negligible overlap with the eigenvectors of interest. For this purpose, a safe and common choice are unstructured Gaussian random matrices. In this work, we investigate the use of random Khatri-Rao products in eigenvalue solvers. On the one hand, we establish a novel subspace embedding property that provides theoretical justification for the use of such structured random matrices. On the other hand, we highlight the potential algorithmic benefits when solving eigenvalue problems with Kronecker product structure, as they arise frequently from the discretization of eigenvalue problems for differential operators on tensor product domains. In particular, we consider the use of random Khatri-Rao products within a contour integral method and LOBPCG. Numerical experiments indicate that the gains for the contour integral method strongly depend on the ability to efficiently and accurately solve (shifted) matrix equations with low-rank right-hand side. The flexibility of LOBPCG to directly employ preconditioners makes it easier to benefit from Khatri-Rao product structure, at the expense of having less theoretical justification.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible. While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii). The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.">

Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

Estimating high-dimensional probability distributions from data samples suffers from an optimization and an approximation curse of dimensionality. It may be avoided by following a hierarchic probability flow from coarse to fine scales. This inverse renormalization group is defined by conditional probabilities across scales, renormalized in a wavelet basis. For a $\varphi^4$ scalar potential, sampling these hierarchic models avoids the critical slowing down at the phase transition. An outstanding issue is to also approximate non-Gaussian fields having long-range interactions in space and across scales. We introduce low-dimensional models with robust multiscale approximations of high order polynomial energies. They are calculated with a second wavelet transform, which defines interactions over two hierarchies of scales. We estimate and sample these wavelet scattering models to generate 2D vorticity fields of turbulence, and images of dark matter densities.">

We demonstrate experimentally that the increase in the sharpness of the Hessian matrix is caused by the layerwise Jacobian matrices of the network becoming aligned, so that a small change in the network preactivations near the inputs of the network can cause a large change in the outputs of the network.

        <tr id="Nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to a combination of noise and time-varying forcing can exhibit sudden changes, critical transitions or tipping points where large or rapid dynamic effects arise from changes in a parameter that are small or slow. Noise-induced tipping can occur where extremes of the forcing causes the system to leave one attractor and transition to another. If this noise corresponds to unresolved chaotic forcing, there is a limit such that this can be approximated by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and the statistics of large deviations determine the transitions. Away from this limit it makes sense to consider tipping in the presence of chaotic rather than stochastic forcing. In general we argue that close to a parameter value where there is a bifurcation of the unforced system, there will be a chaotic tipping window outside of which tipping cannot happen, in the limit of asymptotically slow change of that parameter. This window is trivial for a stochastically forced system. Entry into the chaotic tipping window can be seen as a boundary crisis/non-autonomous saddle-node bifurcation and corresponds to an exceptional case of the forcing, typically by an unstable periodic orbit. We discuss an illustrative example of a chaotically forced bistable map that highlight the richness of the geometry and bifurcation structure of the dynamics in this case. If a parameter is changing slowly we note there is a dynamic tipping window that can also be determined in terms of unstable periodic orbits.">

Central to our methodology is the introduction of a corrective, divergence-free, and unsteady forcing term, derived from a Fourier series expansion, into the URANS equations. This term aims at mitigating discrepancies in the modeled divergence of Reynolds stresses, allowing for the tuning of stationary parameters across different Fourier modes. Our implementation is built upon an extended version of the coupled URANS solver in OpenFOAM, enhanced to compute adjoint variables and gradients. This design choice ensures straightforward applicability to various flow setups and solvers, eliminating the need for specialized harmonic solvers. A gradient-based optimizer is employed to minimize discrepancies between simulated results and sparse velocity reference data. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through its application to flow around a two-dimensional circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 3900. Our results highlight the method's ability to reconstruct mean flow accurately and improve the vortex shedding frequency through the assimilation of zeroth mode data. Additionally, the assimilation of first mode data further enhances the simulation's capability to capture low-frequency dynamics of the flow, and finally, it runs efficiently by leveraging a coarse mesh.">

        <tr id="With the growing interest and applications in machine learning and data science, finding an efficient method to sparse analysis the high-dimensional data and optimizing a dimension reduction model to extract lower dimensional features has becoming more and more important. Orthogonal constraints (Stiefel manifold) is a commonly met constraint in these applications, and the sparsity is usually enforced through the element-wise L1 norm. Many applications can be found on optimization over Stiefel manifold within the area of physics and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel idea by tackling the Stiefel manifold through an nonlinear eigen-approach by first using ADMM to split the problem into smooth optimization over manifold and convex non-smooth optimization, and then transforming the former into the form of nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency (NEPv) which is solved by self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, and the latter can be found to have an closed-form solution through proximal gradient. Compared with existing methods, our proposed algorithm takes the advantage of specific structure of the objective function, and has efficient convergence results under mild assumptions.">

        <tr id="One hundred ninety years ago, Lamé introduced the celebrated ellipsoidal system, which is an orthogonal curvilinear system that incorporates any anisotropic characteristics of three‐dimensional space. Since then, the theory of ellipsoidal harmonics has been successfully developed, but almost nothing has been achieved for ellipsoidal waves. This is due to the fact that, in order to deal with the ellipsoidal harmonics, Lamé introduced some ingenious arguments that led to a complete spectral theory for the Kernel space of the Laplacian, but no such arguments have been proposed for the Kernel space of the d'Alembert operator. So, one possible approach to develop a method that will give us ellipsoidal wave functions is to try to generalize the Lamé arguments (to the extent that this is possible) to four‐dimensional ellipsoidal harmonics. This procedure will give us the hyperellipsoidal harmonics. Then we can replace the fourth coordinate by 
 in order for the four‐dimensional Laplace operator to become the three‐dimensional wave operator of d'Alembert and the four‐dimensional harmonics to become three dimensional waves. The present work is the first stage of this project. It develops the geometry of a four‐dimensional ellipsoidal system and calculates the Laplace operator in this hyperellipsoidal system.">

Consequently, we seek to represent a learnable distribution of high-performance preconditioners from a low-dimensional subspace through a carefully-designed autoencoder, which is able to generate SPAI preconditioners for these systems.

While the utility of encoding geometric structure has been demonstrated empirically, rigorous analysis of its impact on the learnability of neural networks is largely missing. Several recent results have established hardness results for learning feedforward and equivariant neural networks under i.i.d. Gaussian or uniform Boolean data distributions. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of learning under the manifold hypothesis. We ask which minimal assumptions on the curvature and regularity of the manifold, if any, render the learning problem efficiently learnable. We prove that learning is hard under input manifolds of bounded curvature by extending proofs of hardness in the SQ and cryptographic settings for Boolean data inputs to the geometric setting. On the other hand, we show that additional assumptions on the volume of the data manifold alleviate these fundamental limitations and guarantee learnability via a simple interpolation argument. Notable instances of this regime are manifolds which can be reliably reconstructed via manifold learning. Looking forward, we comment on and empirically explore intermediate regimes of manifolds, which have heterogeneous features commonly found in real world data.">

Such models have been extensively studied from the beginning of XXI century both in statistical physics and control theory. They provide a suitable framework for encoding maps between various manifolds and are capable of learning over spherical and hyperbolic geometries. In addition, they can learn coupled actions of transformation groups (such as special orthogonal, unitary and Lorentz groups). Furthermore, we overview families of probability distributions that provide appropriate statistical models for probabilistic modeling and inference in Geometric Deep Learning. We argue in favor of using statistical models which arise in different Kuramoto models in the continuum limit of particles.

Here, hinging on ideas from group representation theory, we define trainable layers whose algebraic structure is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the lattice cell. Our method naturally allows for efficient implementations, both in terms of memory usage and computational costs, supporting scalable training/testing for lattices in two spatial dimensions and higher, as the size of symmetry group grows. We validate and test our approach considering 2D and 3D flowing dynamics, both in laminar and turbulent regimes. We compare with group averaged-based symmetric networks and with plain, non-symmetric, networks, showing how our approach unlocks the (a-posteriori) accuracy and training stability of the former models, and the train/inference speed of the latter networks (LENNs are about one order of magnitude faster than group-averaged networks in 3D).

Through KPCA, we illustrate that the reduced order approximations conserve the invariants, i.e., Hamiltonian, momentum and mass structure of the KdV equation.

We present mace, a Machine learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation, as a proof-of-concept work on emulating chemistry in a dynamical environment. Using the context of AGB outflows, we have developed an architecture that combines the use of an autoencoder (to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical network) and a set of latent ordinary differential equations (that are solved to perform the temporal evolution of the reduced features). Training this architecture with an integrated scheme makes it possible to successfully reproduce a full chemical pathway in a dynamical environment. mace outperforms its classical analogue on average by a factor 26.

Here, data-driven approaches can be used to deliver a pHS for such subsystems, which can then be coupled to the other subsystems in a structure-preserving way.

The approach uses input and state space data to estimate nonlinear effort functions of pH-DAEs. As underlying technique, we us (multi-task) Gaussian processes. This work thereby extends over the current state of the art, in which only port-Hamiltonian ordinary differential equation systems could be identified via Gaussian processes.

To address this, we propose a two-step solution. Firstly, we develop a stable dimension reduction technique, projecting the law of a reasonably broad class of Volterra process onto a low-dimensional statistical manifold of non-positive sectional curvature. Next, we introduce a sequentially deep learning model tailored to the manifold's geometry, which we show can approximate the projected conditional law of the Volterra process. Our model leverages an auxiliary hypernetwork to dynamically update its internal parameters, allowing it to encode non-stationary dynamics of the Volterra process, and it can be interpreted as a gating mechanism in a mixture of expert models where each expert is specialized at a specific point in time. Our hypernetwork further allows us to achieve approximation rates that would seemingly only be possible with very large networks.">

We present various strategies to learn the operator content of the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad operators of the Liouvillian.

Initially, the learning error decreasing with the inverse square root of the number of runs, as the error in the reconstructed parameters is dominated by shot noise. Eventually the learning error remains constant, allowing us to recognize missing ansatz terms. A central aspect of our approach is to (re-)parametrize ans\"atze by introducing and varying the dependencies between parameters. This allows us to identify the relevant parameters of the system, thereby reducing the complexity of the learning task. Importantly, this (re-)parametrization relies solely on classical post-processing, which is compelling given the finite amount of data available from experiments. A distinguishing feature of our approach is the possibility to learn the Hamiltonian, without the necessity of learning the complete Liouvillian, thus further reducing the complexity of the learning task.

However, the applicability of equilibrium points and periodic orbits may be questionable in real-world applications where the uncertainties of the initial conditions of the spacecraft and dynamical parameters of the problem (e.g., mass ratio parameter) are taken into consideration. Due to uncertain parameters and initial conditions, the spacecraft might not follow the reference periodic orbit owing to growing uncertainties that cause the satellite to deviate from its nominal path. Hence, it is crucial to keep track of the probability of finding the spacecraft in a given region. Building on previous work, we extend numerical continuation to moments of the distribution (i.e., stochastic continuation) by directly continuing moments of the probability density function of the spacecraft state. Only assuming normality of the initial conditions, and leveraging moment-generating functions, Isserlis' theorem, and the algebra of truncated polynomials, we propagate the distribution of the spacecraft state at consecutive surface of section crossings while retaining a symbolic map of the final moments of the distribution that depend on the initial mean and covariance matrix only. The goal of the work is to offer a differential algebra-based general framework to continue 3D periodic orbits in the presence of uncertain dynamical systems.

        <tr id="Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.">

The proposed methods use a preconditioned Krylov subspace method for a high-fidelity discretization of one parameter instance to generate orthogonal basis vectors of the reduced basis subspace. Then large-scale discrete parameter-dependent problems are approximately solved in the low-dimensional Krylov subspace. As shown in the theory and experiments, only a small number of Krylov subspace iterations are needed to simultaneously generate approximate solutions of a family of high-fidelity and large-scale systems in the reduced basis subspace. This reduces the computational cost dramatically because (1) to construct the reduced basis vectors, we only solve one large-scale problem in the high-fidelity level; and (2) the family of large-scale problems restricted to the reduced basis subspace have much smaller sizes.">

        <tr id="This paper explores the efficacy of diffusion-based generative models as neural operators for partial differential equations (PDEs). Neural operators are neural networks that learn a mapping from the parameter space to the solution space of PDEs from data, and they can also solve the inverse problem of estimating the parameter from the solution. Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

        <tr id="The article is devoted to the creation of methodological foundations for solving a direct problem of dynamics for linear dynamic systems, the motion of which is described by ordinary differential equations with nonzero initial conditions. Consideration of the motions of linear dynamic systems allows to simplify the mathematical apparatus used and to solve motion determination problems by using a known approach based on transfer functions. However, due to the fact that the classical definition of transfer functions does not involve taking into account non-zero initial conditions, which are caused by the presence of initial deviations of the coordinates of the control object from their desired values, in our work we use the Laplace-Carson transformation to find the corresponding images and write the equations of motion in operator form. This approach, in contrast to the generally acceptedone, led to the introduction of information about the initial conditions of motion in the right-hand side of the corresponding operator differential equations and necessitated the generalization of the vector of control signals by including in it components that take into account the initial conditions of motion of the system under consideration. Such transformations made it possible to generalize the concept of a matrix transfer function as a matrix linear dynamic operator, which consists of two components that define disturbed free and controlled forced movements. The use of such an operator makes it possible to study the dynamics of the considered linear system both separately for each of the components of the generalized vector of controlling influences, and in the complex, thus solving the direct problem of the dynamics of linear systems.">

        <tr id="The generative modeling of data on manifold is an important task, for which diffusion models in flat spaces typically need nontrivial adaptations. This article demonstrates how a technique called `trivialization' can transfer the effectiveness of diffusion models in Euclidean spaces to Lie groups. In particular, an auxiliary momentum variable was algorithmically introduced to help transport the position variable between data distribution and a fixed, easy-to-sample distribution. Normally, this would incur further difficulty for manifold data because momentum lives in a space that changes with the position. However, our trivialization technique creates to a new momentum variable that stays in a simple $\textbf{fixed vector space}$. This design, together with a manifold preserving integrator, simplifies implementation and avoids inaccuracies created by approximations such as projections to tangent space and manifold, which were typically used in prior work, hence facilitating generation with high-fidelity and efficiency. The resulting method achieves state-of-the-art performance on protein and RNA torsion angle generation and sophisticated torus datasets. We also, arguably for the first time, tackle the generation of data on high-dimensional Special Orthogonal and Unitary groups, the latter essential for quantum problems.">

Fractional derivatives, especially those defined in the Caputo sense, provide a useful tool for modeling memory and hereditary characteristics, which are problems that are frequently faced with integer-order models. We use the Chebyshev spectral approach for spatial derivatives, which is known for its faster convergence rate, in conjunction with the L1 scheme for time-fractional derivatives because of its high accuracy and robustness in handling nonlocal effects. A detailed theoretical analysis, followed by a number of numerical experiments, is performed to confirmed the theoretical justification. Our simulation results show that our numerical technique significantly improves the convergence rates, effectively tackles computing difficulties, and provides a realistic simulation of biological population dynamics.">

        <tr id="Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.">

        <tr id="We present a domain decomposition strategy for developing structure-preserving finite element discretizations from data when exact governing equations are unknown. On subdomains, trainable Whitney form elements are used to identify structure-preserving models from data, providing a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map which may be used to globally construct a mortar method. The reduced-order local elements may be trained offline to reproduce high-fidelity Dirichlet data in cases where first principles model derivation is either intractable, unknown, or computationally prohibitive. In such cases, particular care must be taken to preserve structure on both local and mortar levels without knowledge of the governing equations, as well as to ensure well-posedness and stability of the resulting monolithic data-driven system. This strategy provides a flexible means of both scaling to large systems and treating complex geometries, and is particularly attractive for multiscale problems with complex microstructure geometry. While consistency is traditionally obtained in finite element methods via quasi-optimality results and the Bramble-Hilbert lemma as the local element diameter $h\rightarrow0$, our analysis establishes notions of accuracy and stability for finite h with accuracy coming from matching data. Numerical experiments and analysis establish properties for $H(\operatorname{div})$ problems in small data limits ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ reference solutions).">

They link the neural substrate to the generalization capabilities and provide a unified methodology bridging gaps between neuroscience, machine learning, and cognitive science. We overview recent progress in studying the geometry of neural manifolds, particularly in visual object recognition, and discuss theories connecting manifold dimension and radius to generalization capacity. Second, we suggest that the theory of learning in wide DNNs, especially in the thermodynamic limit, provides mechanistic insights into the learning processes generating desired neural representational geometries and generalization. This includes the role of weight norm regularization, network architecture, and hyper-parameters. We will explore recent advances in this theory and ongoing challenges.

One advantage of the neural network method for PDEs lies in its automatic differentiation (AD), which necessitates only the sample points themselves, unlike traditional finite difference (FD) approximations that require nearby local points to compute derivatives. In this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of AD in training neural networks. The concept of truncated entropy is introduced to characterize the training property. Specifically, through comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses conducted on random feature models and two-layer neural networks, we discover that the defined truncated entropy serves as a reliable metric for quantifying the residual loss of random feature models and the training speed of neural networks for both AD and FD methods. Our experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that, from a training perspective, AD outperforms FD in solving partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Learning from expert demonstrations to flexibly program an autonomous system with complex behaviors or to predict an agent's behavior is a powerful tool, especially in collaborative control settings. A common method to solve this problem is inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), where the observed agent, e.g., a human demonstrator, is assumed to behave according to the optimization of an intrinsic cost function that reflects its intent and informs its control actions. While the framework is expressive, it is also computationally demanding and generally lacks convergence guarantees. We therefore propose a novel, stability-certified IRL approach by reformulating the cost function inference problem to learning control Lyapunov functions (CLF) from demonstrations data. By additionally exploiting closed-form expressions for associated control policies, we are able to efficiently search the space of CLFs by observing the attractor landscape of the induced dynamics. For the construction of the inverse optimal CLFs, we use a Sum of Squares and formulate a convex optimization problem. We present a theoretical analysis of the optimality properties provided by the CLF and evaluate our approach using both simulated and real-world data.">

        <tr id="Studying the dynamical, nonlinear regime of modified theories of gravity remains a theoretical challenge that limits our ability to test general relativity. Here we consider two generally applicable, but approximate methods for treating modifications to full general relativity that have been used to study binary black hole mergers and other phenomena in this regime, and compare solutions obtained by them to those from solving the full equations of motion. The first method evolves corrections to general relativity order by order in a perturbative expansion, while the second method introduces extra dynamical fields in such a way that strong hyperbolicity is recovered. We use shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity as a benchmark theory to illustrate the differences between these methods for several spacetimes of physical interest. We study the formation of scalar hair about initially non-spinning black holes, the collision of black holes with scalar charge, and the inspiral and merger of binary black holes. By directly comparing predictions, we assess the extent to which those from the approximate treatments can be meaningfully confronted with gravitational wave observations. We find that the order-by-order approach cannot faithfully track the solutions when the corrections to general relativity are non-negligible. The second approach, however, can provide consistent solutions, provided the ad-hoc timescale over which the dynamical fields are driven to their target values is made short compared to the physical timescales.">

However, identifying the parameters, especially the time delay, that make a DDE's predictions match experimental results can be challenging. We introduce DDE-Find, a data-driven framework for learning a DDE's parameters, time delay, and initial condition function. DDE-Find uses an adjoint-based approach to efficiently compute the gradient of a loss function with respect to the model parameters. We motivate and rigorously prove an expression for the gradients of the loss using the adjoint. DDE-Find builds upon recent developments in learning DDEs from data and delivers the first complete framework for learning DDEs from data. Through a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that DDE-Find can learn DDEs from noisy, limited data.">

In this paper, we study the problem of using meta-learning to deal with uncertainty and heterogeneity in ergodic linear quadratic regulators. We integrate the zeroth-order optimization technique with a typical meta-learning method, proposing an algorithm that omits the estimation of policy Hessian, which applies to tasks of learning a set of heterogeneous but similar linear dynamic systems. The induced meta-objective function inherits important properties of the original cost function when the set of linear dynamic systems are meta-learnable, allowing the algorithm to optimize over a learnable landscape without projection onto the feasible set. We provide a convergence result for the exact gradient descent process by analyzing the boundedness and smoothness of the gradient for the meta-objective, which justify the proposed algorithm with gradient estimation error being small. We also provide a numerical example to corroborate this perspective.">

It is a machine learning technique that generates analytical relationships between inputs and outputs of a given dataset via invertible maps (or architectures). The proposed ISR method naturally combines the principles of Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) and Equation Learner (EQL), a neural network-based symbolic architecture for function learning. In particular, we transform the affine coupling blocks of INNs into a symbolic framework, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable symbolic invertible architecture that allows for efficient gradient-based learning. The proposed ISR framework also relies on sparsity promoting regularization, allowing the discovery of concise and interpretable invertible expressions. We show that ISR can serve as a (symbolic) normalizing flow for density estimation tasks. Furthermore, we highlight its practical applicability in solving inverse problems, including a benchmark inverse kinematics problem, and notably, a geoacoustic inversion problem in oceanography aimed at inferring posterior distributions of underlying seabed parameters from acoustic signals.">

The paper details how a recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be transformed into a contraction in a domain where its parameters are linear. It then demonstrates that a prediction problem modeled through an RNN, with a specific regularization term in the loss function, can have its first-order conditions expressed analytically. This system of equations is reduced to two matrix equations involving Sylvester equations, which can be partially solved. We establish that, if certain conditions are met, optimal parameters exist, are unique, and can be found through a straightforward algorithm to any desired precision. Also, as the number of neurons grows the conditions of convergence become easier to fulfill. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) are also explored by including linear constraints on parameters. According to our model, incorporating loops (with fixed or variable weights) will produce loss functions that train easier, because it assures the existence of a region where an iterative method converges.">

However, currently available neural network-based modeling approaches fall short when faced with data collected randomly over time and space, as is often the case with sensor networks in real-world applications like crowdsourced earthquake detection or pollution monitoring. In response, we developed a new spatiotemporal method that effectively handles such randomly sampled data. Our model integrates techniques from amortized variational inference, neural differential equations, neural point processes, and implicit neural representations to predict both the dynamics of the system and the probabilistic locations and timings of future observations. It outperforms existing methods on challenging spatiotemporal datasets by offering substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a useful tool for modeling and understanding complex dynamical systems observed under realistic, unconstrained conditions.">

        <tr id="Many cognitive models, including those for predicting the time of future events, can be mapped onto a particular form of neural representation in which activity across a population of neurons is restricted to manifolds that specify the Laplace transform of functions of continuous variables. These populations coding Laplace transform are associated with another population that inverts the transform, approximating the original function. This paper presents a neural circuit that uses continuous attractor dynamics to represent the Laplace transform of a delta function evolving in time. One population places an edge at any location along a 1-D array of neurons; another population places a bump at a location corresponding to the edge. Together these two populations can estimate a Laplace transform of delta functions in time along with an approximate inverse transform. Building the circuit so the edge moves at an appropriate speed enables the network to represent events as a function of log time. Choosing the connections appropriately within the edge network make the network states map onto Laplace transform with exponential change as a function of time. In this paper we model a learned temporal association in which one stimulus predicts another at some fixed delay $T$. Shortly after $t=0$ the first stimulus recedes into the past. The Laplace Neural Manifold representing the past maintains the Laplace transform $\exp(-st)$. Another Laplace Neural Manifold represents the predicted future. At $t=0$, the second stimulus is represented a time $T$ in the future. At each moment between 0 and $T$, firing over the Laplace transform predicting the future changes as $\exp[-s(T-t)]$. Despite exponential growth in firing, the circuit is robust to noise, making it a practical means to implement Laplace Neural Manifolds in populations of neurons for a variety of cognitive models.">

        <tr id="We introduce a novel generative model for the representation of joint probability distributions of a possibly large number of discrete random variables. The approach uses measure transport by randomized assignment flows on the statistical submanifold of factorizing distributions, which also enables to sample efficiently from the target distribution and to assess the likelihood of unseen data points. The embedding of the flow via the Segre map in the meta-simplex of all discrete joint distributions ensures that any target distribution can be represented in principle, whose complexity in practice only depends on the parametrization of the affinity function of the dynamical assignment flow system. Our model can be trained in a simulation-free manner without integration by conditional Riemannian flow matching, using the training data encoded as geodesics in closed-form with respect to the e-connection of information geometry. By projecting high-dimensional flow matching in the meta-simplex of joint distributions to the submanifold of factorizing distributions, our approach has strong motivation from first principles of modeling coupled discrete variables. Numerical experiments devoted to distributions of structured image labelings demonstrate the applicability to large-scale problems, which may include discrete distributions in other application areas. Performance measures show that our approach scales better with the increasing number of classes than recent related work.">

To address this challenge, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach together with Graph Neural Network. We thus propose Neural Bond Graph Encoder (NBgE), a model agnostic physical-informed encoder tailored for multi-physics systems.

While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

We provide a method to determine the dimension of the equivalence classes and evaluate it for various models, such as the $ XY $ chain and Kitaev model on trees. Our findings reveal that the complexity of operator evolution in the $XY$ model grows from the edge to the bulk, which is physically manifested as suppressed relaxation of qubits near the boundary.

The PGD approach utilizes low-dimensional subspaces of the time response to approximate the solution as a low-order separated representation of spatial and temporal components, with the Galerkin projection employed to formulate subproblems for each component. The subproblem for spatial basis is viewed as computing a reduced-order criterion, and the temporal problem projected to a subspace spanning this criterion uses time integration to obtain time coefficients. During the time integration, the spatial modes obtained from the calculation of the previous step are used as a reduced basis, and additional spatial modes are added until the residual of equations of motion satisfy the target tolerance. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method allows significant computational savings compared to conventional time integration methods while accurately reflecting the nonlinear behavior.">

We apply the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm in its full generality unraveling a total of $4m$ second-class constraints and obtain the corresponding Dirac brackets algebra in phase space.

Recently, a systematic construction of such perturbations based on the so-called long-range deformations of integrable chains was formulated. These perturbations, obtained as truncations of the long-range deformations in some small parameter expansions, can be viewed as produced by unitary rotations of the short-range integrable models. For infinite systems, several ''generators'' (extensive local, boosted, and bilocal operators) of weak perturbations are known. The main aim of this work is to understand the appropriate generators in finite systems with periodic boundaries since simple counterparts to boosted and bilocal operators are not known in such cases. We approach this by studying the structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), a proxy for such generators in finite chains, which was originally introduced as a very sensitive measure of quantum chaos. We prove an exact relation between the AGPs for the boosted and bilocal classes of generators and note that the counterpart to boost does not seem to have a closed analytic form in finite systems but shows quasi-locality nonetheless. We also introduce and study strictly local variants of weak integrability-breaking perturbations.">

        <tr id="We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the 'explicit' dynamics of the object with an 'implicit' flow on free energy gradients - a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.">

        <tr id="We consider a control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker--Planck equation. This equation describes the evolution of the distribution of nonlocally interacting particles affected by a common source of noise. The system is directed by a controller that acts on the drift term with the goal of minimising a cost functional. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation, prove the existence of optimal controls, and formulate a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) that provides necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the control problem. The adjoint process arising in the SMP is characterised by a nonlocal (semi)linear backward SPDE for which we study existence and uniqueness. We also rigorously connect the control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker--Planck equation to the control of the corresponding McKean--Vlasov SDE that describes the motion of a representative particle. Our work extends existing results for the control of the Fokker--Planck equation to nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. In particular, the sufficient SMP, which we obtain by exploiting the special structure of the Fokker--Planck equation, seems to be novel even in the linear deterministic setting. We illustrate our results with an application to a model of government interventions in financial systems, supplemented by numerical illustrations.">

        <tr id="In multilayer complex networks, the uncertainty in node states leads to intricate behaviors. It is, therefore, of great importance to be able to estimate the states of target nodes in these systems, both for theoretical advancements and practical applications. This paper introduces a state observer-based approach for the state estimation of such networks, focusing specifically on a class of complex dynamic networks with nodes that correspond one-to-one. Initially, a chaotic system is employed to model the dynamics of each node and highlight the essential state components for analysis and derivation. A network state observer is then constructed using a unique diagonal matrix, which underpins the driver and response-layer networks. By integrating control theory and stability function analysis, the effectiveness of the observer in achieving synchronization between complex dynamic networks and target systems is confirmed. Additionally, the efficacy and precision of the proposed method are validated through simulation.">

Diffusion geometry uses the Bakry-Emery $\Gamma$-calculus of Markov diffusion operators to define objects from Riemannian geometry on a wide range of probability spaces. We construct statistical estimators for these objects from a sample of data, and so introduce a whole family of new methods for geometric data analysis and computational geometry. This includes vector fields and differential forms on the data, and many of the important operators in exterior calculus. Unlike existing methods like persistent homology and local principal component analysis, diffusion geometry is explicitly related to Riemannian geometry, and is significantly more robust to noise, significantly faster to compute, provides a richer topological description (like the cup product on cohomology), and is naturally vectorised for statistics and machine learning. We find that diffusion geometry outperforms multiparameter persistent homology as a biomarker for real and simulated tumour histology data and can robustly measure the manifold hypothesis by detecting singularities in manifold-like data.">

The key idea is to estimate of a collection of simple local models as opposed to a single and complex regression model trained in the entire input space. We use principles from the Online Deterministic Annealing (ODA) optimization framework to construct an adaptive partition of the input space, which enables the introduction of local function approximation models within each subset of the partition. We show that both the partitioning and the local model training algorithms are stochastic approximation algorithms that operate online, and with the same observations, as part of a two-timescale stochastic approximation scheme. This process constitutes a heuristic method to gradually increase the complexity of the function approximation framework in a task-agnostic manner, giving emphasis to regions of the input space where the regression error is high. As a result this framework has inherent explainability properties, and is suitable for continuous learning applications where regression improvement without retraining from scratch is crucial.

The method can be used on today's largest simulations and will be essential to solve the extreme data exploration and analysis challenges posed by the Exascale era. Furthermore, this concept is so flexible, that it will also enable explorative access to observed data.

The simulation data is projected onto this space for interactive inspection, visual interpretation, sample selection, and local analysis. We present a prototype using a rotational invariant hyperspherical variational convolutional autoencoder, utilizing a power distribution in the latent space, and trained on galaxies from IllustrisTNG simulation.

These include linear mode connectivity, model merging, Bayesian neural network inference, metanetworks, and several other characteristics of optimization or loss-landscapes. However, theoretical analysis of the relationship between parameter space symmetries and these phenomena is difficult. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of neural parameter symmetries by introducing new neural network architectures that have reduced parameter space symmetries. We develop two methods, with some provable guarantees, of modifying standard neural networks to reduce parameter space symmetries. With these new methods, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study consisting of multiple tasks aimed at assessing the effect of removing parameter symmetries. Our experiments reveal several interesting observations on the empirical impact of parameter symmetries; for instance, we observe linear mode connectivity between our networks without alignment of weight spaces, and we find that our networks allow for faster and more effective Bayesian neural network training.">

Here, we investigate if externally applied inputs to these RNNs can stabilize globally synchronous, input-dependent solutions, in spite of the strong chaos-inducing coupling. We find that when the balance between excitation and inhibition is exact, that is when the row-sum of the weights is constant and 0, a globally applied input can readily synchronize all neurons onto a synchronous solution. The stability of the synchronous solution is analytically explored in this work with a master stability function. For any synchronous solution to the network dynamics, the conditional Lyapunov spectrum can be readily determined, with the stability of the synchronous solution critically dependent on the largest real eigenvalue component of the RNN weight matrix. We find that the smaller the maximum real component of the weight matrix eigenvalues, the more readily the network synchronizes. Further, the conditional Lyapunov exponents are easily computed numerically for any synchronization signal without simulating the RNN. Finally, for certain oscillatory synchronization signals, the conditional Lyapunov exponents can be determined analytically.">

These problems are crucial in areas such as economics, physics, and biology. We consider the non-local setting, where the interactions between agents are governed by a suitable kernel. For $N$ agents, the interaction cost has $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity, which can be prohibitively slow to evaluate and differentiate when $N$ is large. To this end, we propose an efficient primal-dual algorithm that utilizes basis expansions of the kernels. The basis expansions reduce the cost of computing the interactions, while the primal-dual methodology decouples the agents at the expense of solving for a moderate number of dual variables. We also demonstrate that our approach can further be structured in a multi-resolution manner, where we estimate optimal dual variables using a moderate $N$ and solve decoupled trajectory optimization problems for large $N$. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on an optimal control of 5000 interacting quadrotors.">

Traditional techniques like the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) have been widely used for this purpose. However, recent advancements in computational power have allowed for the development of data-driven modal reduction approaches. This paper discusses four applications of deep neural networks for aerodynamic applications, including a convolutional neural network autoencoder, to analyze unsteady flow fields around a circular cylinder at Re = 100 and a supersonic boundary layer with Tollmien–Schlichting waves. The autoencoder results are comparable to those obtained with POD and spectral POD. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the autoencoder can compress steady hypersonic boundary-layer profiles into a low-dimensional vector space that is spanned by the pressure gradient and wall-temperature ratio. This paper also proposes a convolutional neural network model to estimate velocity and temperature profiles across different hypersonic flow conditions.">

This approach effectively reduces the computational complexity associated with utilizing second-order information, rendering it applicable in higher-dimensional scenarios. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for non-convex functions, with interpolating rates for arbitrary subspace sizes and allowing inexact curvature estimation. When increasing subspace size, our complexity matches $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ of the cubic regularization (CR) rate. Additionally, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme ensuring exact convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2}, \epsilon^{-3})$ to a second-order stationary point, even without sampling all coordinates.

One of the defining characteristics of reservoir computing is its low cost and straightforward training algorithm, i.e. only the readout, given by a linear combination of reservoir variables, is trained. Inspired by recent mathematical studies based on dynamical system theory, in particular generalized synchronization, we propose a novel reservoir computing framework with generalized readout, including a nonlinear combination of reservoir variables. The first crucial advantage of using the generalized readout is its mathematical basis for improving information processing capabilities. Secondly, it is still within a linear learning framework, which preserves the original strength of reservoir computing. In summary, the generalized readout is naturally derived from mathematical theory and allows the extraction of useful basis functions from reservoir dynamics without sacrificing simplicity. In a numerical study, we find that introducing the generalized readout leads to a significant improvement in accuracy and an unexpected enhancement in robustness for the short- and long-term prediction of Lorenz chaos, with a particular focus on how to harness low-dimensional reservoir dynamics. A novel way and its advantages for physical implementations of reservoir computing with generalized readout are briefly discussed.">

Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.">

In contrast, Particle filters yield the correct distribution in the ensemble limit but require substantially larger ensemble sizes than ensemble-based filters to maintain stability in higher-dimensional spaces. It is essential to transcend traditional Gaussian assumptions to achieve realistic quantification of uncertainties. One approach involves the hybridisation of filters, facilitated by tempering, to harness the complementary strengths of different filters. A new adaptive tempering method is proposed to tune the underlying schedule, aiming to systematically surpass the performance previously achieved.

This is especially true for models targeting the properties of matter at the atomic scale. Both established and state-of-the-art approaches, with almost no exceptions, are built to be exactly equivariant to translations, permutations, and rotations of the atoms. Incorporating symmetries -- rotations in particular -- constrains the model design space and implies more complicated architectures that are often also computationally demanding. There are indications that non-symmetric models can easily learn symmetries from data, and that doing so can even be beneficial for the accuracy of the model. We put a model that obeys rotational invariance only approximately to the test, in realistic scenarios involving simulations of gas-phase, liquid, and solid water. We focus specifically on physical observables that are likely to be affected -- directly or indirectly -- by symmetry breaking, finding negligible consequences when the model is used in an interpolative, bulk, regime. Even for extrapolative gas-phase predictions, the model remains very stable, even though symmetry artifacts are noticeable. We also discuss strategies that can be used to systematically reduce the magnitude of symmetry breaking when it occurs, and assess their impact on the convergence of observables.">

In this article, a generalized deep NN (DNN) architecture with an arbitrary number of hidden layers is considered, and a new DNN-based accelerated gradient adaptation scheme is developed to generate estimates of all the DNN weights in real-time. A nonsmooth Lyapunov-based analysis is used to guarantee the developed accelerated gradient-based DNN adaptation design achieves global asymptotic tracking error convergence for general nonlinear control affine systems subject to unknown (non-LIP) drift dynamics and exogenous disturbances. A comprehensive set of simulation studies are conducted on a two-state nonlinear system, a robotic manipulator, and a complex 20-D nonlinear system to demonstrate the improved performance of the developed method. Our simulation studies demonstrate enhanced tracking and function approximation performance from both DNN architectures and accelerated gradient adaptation.">

        <tr id="One of the core concepts in science, and something that happens intuitively in every-day dynamic systems modeling, is the combination of models or methods. Especially in dynamical systems modeling, often two or more structures are combined to obtain a more powerful or efficient architecture regarding a specific application (area). Further, even physical simulations are combined with machine learning architectures, to increase prediction accuracy or optimize the computational performance. In this work, we shortly discuss, which types of models are usually combined and propose a model interface that is capable of expressing a width variety of mixed algebraic, discrete and differential equation based models. Further, we examine different established, as well as new ways of combining these models from a system theoretical point of view and highlight two challenges - algebraic loops and local event affect functions in discontinuous models - that require a special approach. Finally, we propose a new wildcard topology, that is capable of describing the generic connection between two combined models in an easy to interpret fashion that can be learned as part of a gradient based optimization procedure. The contributions of this paper are highlighted at a proof of concept: Different connection topologies between two models are learned, interpreted and compared applying the proposed methodology and software implementation.">

        <tr id="We propose a computationally efficient and systematically convergent approach for elastodynamics simulations. We recast the second-order dynamical equation of elastodynamics into an equivalent first-order system of coupled equations, so as to express the solution in the form of a Magnus expansion. With any spatial discretization, it entails computing the exponential of a matrix acting upon a vector. We employ an adaptive Krylov subspace approach to inexpensively and and accurately evaluate the action of the exponential matrix on a vector. In particular, we use an apriori error estimate to predict the optimal Kyrlov subspace size required for each time-step size. We show that the Magnus expansion truncated after its first term provides quadratic and superquadratic convergence in the time-step for nonlinear and linear elastodynamics, respectively. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for one linear (linear cantilever beam) and three nonlinear (nonlinear cantilever beam, soft tissue elastomer, and hyperelastic rubber) benchmark systems. For a desired accuracy in energy, displacement, and velocity, our method allows for $10-100\times$ larger time-steps than conventional time-marching schemes such as Newmark-$\beta$ method. Computationally, it translates to a $\sim$$1000\times$ and $\sim$$10-100\times$ speed-up over conventional time-marching schemes for linear and nonlinear elastodynamics, respectively.">

        <tr id="The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is a prototype of a complex non-convex energy landscape. Dynamical processes evolving on such landscapes and locally aiming to reach minima are generally poorly understood. Here, we study quenches, i.e. dynamics that locally aim to decrease energy. We analyse the energy at convergence for two distinct algorithmic classes, single-spin flip and synchronous dynamics, focusing on greedy and reluctant strategies. We provide precise numerical analysis of the finite size effects and conclude that, perhaps counter-intuitively, the reluctant algorithm is compatible with converging to the ground state energy density, while the greedy strategy is not. Inspired by the single-spin reluctant and greedy algorithms, we investigate two synchronous time algorithms, the sync-greedy and sync-reluctant algorithms. These synchronous processes can be analysed using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), and a new backtracking version of DMFT. Notably, this is the first time the backtracking DMFT is applied to study dynamical convergence properties in fully connected disordered models. The analysis suggests that the sync-greedy algorithm can also achieve energies compatible with the ground state, and that it undergoes a dynamical phase transition.">

        <tr id="We demonstrate the first successful non-invasive stabilisation of nonlinear travelling waves in a straight circular pipe using time-delayed feedback control (TDF). The main novelty in this work is in the application of a"multiple time-delayed feedback"(MTDF) approach, where several control terms are required to attenuate a broad range of unstable eigenfrequencies. We implement a gradient descent method to dynamically adjust the gain functions, $G_i(t),$ in order to reduce the need for tuning a high dimensional parameter space. We consider the effect of the control terms via an approximate linear analysis and a frequency-domain analysis, which justifies the choice of MTDF parameters. By using an adaptive approach to setting the control gains, we advocate for a broad range of MTDF terms which are then free to find their own stabilising amplitudes for a given target solution, thereby removing trial and error when the instability of the target solution is unknown a'priori. This also enables travelling waves to be stabilised from generic turbulent states and with speculative starting parameters.">

To overcome the deficiencies of classical SIMs, a significant number of algorithms has appeared over the last two decades, where most of them involve a common intermediate step, that is to estimate the range space of the extended observability matrix. In this contribution, an optimized version of the parallel and parsimonious SIM (PARSIM), PARSIM\textsubscript{opt}, is proposed by using weighted least-squares. It not only inherits all the benefits of PARSIM but also attains the best linear unbiased estimator for the above intermediate step. Furthermore, inspired by SIMs based on the predictor form, consistent estimates of the optimal weighting matrix for weighted least-squares are derived. Essential similarities, differences and simulated comparisons of some key SIMs related to our method are also presented.">

Here we describe the input-output relations of the classical Preisach operator, its basic properties, methods of constructing the output using the demagnetization function formalism, a generalization of the classical Preisach operator for the case of vector input-output relations. Various generalizations of the model are described here in relation to systems containing ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials. The main attention we pay to experimental works, where the Preisach model has been used for analytic description of the experimentally observed results. Also, we describe a wide range of the technical applications of the Preisach model in such fields as energy storage devices, systems under piezoelectric effect, models of systems with long-term memory. The properties of the Preisach operator in terms of reaction to stochastic external impacts are described and a generalization of the model for the case of the stochastic threshold numbers of its elementary components is given.">

        <tr id="Neural networks are lately more and more often being used in the context of data-driven control, as an approximate model of the true system dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) adopts this practise leading to neural MPC strategies. This raises a question of whether the trained neural network has converged and generalized in a way that the learned model encapsulates an accurate approximation of the true dynamic model of the system, thus making it a reliable choice for model-based control, especially for disturbed and uncertain systems. To tackle that, we propose Dropout MPC, a novel sampling-based ensemble neural MPC algorithm that employs the Monte-Carlo dropout technique on the learned system model. The closed loop is based on an ensemble of predictive controllers, that are used simultaneously at each time-step for trajectory optimization. Each member of the ensemble influences the control input, based on a weighted voting scheme, thus by employing different realizations of the learned system dynamics, neural control becomes more reliable by design. An additional strength of the method is that it offers by design a way to estimate future uncertainty, leading to cautious control. While the method aims in general at uncertain systems with complex dynamics, where models derived from first principles are hard to infer, to showcase the application we utilize data gathered in the laboratory from a real mobile manipulator and employ the proposed algorithm for the navigation of the robot in simulation.">

We systematically compare the respective strengths and weaknesses of these three methods on simulated non-Gaussian densities as well as on real-world terrain-relative navigation data. Our results show that these deep learning methods can accurately capture complex uncertainty patterns, highlighting their potential for improving the reliability and robustness of estimation systems.">

        <tr id="Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e.,"steering") the distribution of an ensemble system. In addition, in most of the existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Both linear and nonlinear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide numerical results to validate our theoretical developments. These include cases where the parameter distribution is uniform, Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and multi-modal, respectively.">

In this work, we propose that a ML model, trained to predict the state one-step-ahead from several latest historic states, can accurately replicate the bifurcation diagram and the Lyapunov exponents of discrete dynamic systems. The characteristics for different values of the hyper-parameters are captured universally by a single ML model, while the previous works considered training the ML model independently by fixing the hyper-parameters to be specific values. Our benchmarks on the one- and two-dimensional Logistic maps show that variational quantum circuit can reproduce the long-term characteristics with higher accuracy than the long short-term memory (a well-recognized classical ML model). Our work reveals an essential difference between the ML for the chaotic characteristics and that for standard tasks, from the perspective of the relation between performance and model complexity. Our results suggest that quantum circuit model exhibits potential advantages on mitigating over-fitting, achieving higher accuracy and stability.">

The goal is to minimize a cost function while satisfying constraints against the worst-case realization of the uncertainty, which is quantified using distributional ambiguity sets. The latter are defined as balls in the Wasserstein metric centered on the predictive empirical distribution computed from a set of collected trajectory data. By harnessing techniques from robust control and distributionally robust optimization, we characterize the distributional shift between the predictive and the actual closed-loop distributions, and highlight its dependency on the model mismatch and the uncertainty about the disturbance distribution. We also provide bounds on the number of samples required to achieve a desired confidence level and propose a tractable approximate formulation for the doubly robust data-driven controller.

We prove that these random neural networks are well-defined non-Gaussian processes. As a by-product, we demonstrate that these networks are solutions to stochastic differential equations driven by impulsive white noise (combinations of random Dirac measures). These processes are parameterized by the law of the weights and biases as well as the density of activation thresholds in each bounded region of the input domain. We prove that these processes are isotropic and wide-sense self-similar with Hurst exponent $3/2$. We also derive a remarkably simple closed-form expression for their autocovariance function. Our results are fundamentally different from prior work in that we consider a non-asymptotic viewpoint: The number of neurons in each bounded region of the input domain (i.e., the width) is itself a random variable with a Poisson law with mean proportional to the density parameter. Finally, we show that, under suitable hypotheses, as the expected width tends to infinity, these processes can converge in law not only to Gaussian processes, but also to non-Gaussian processes depending on the law of the weights. Our asymptotic results provide a new take on several classical results (wide networks converge to Gaussian processes) as well as some new ones (wide networks can converge to non-Gaussian processes).">

This result considerably generalizes and unifies the results of Morris (2010) and Shinoda (2018), and applies to a wide class of intrinsically ergodic non-Markov symbolic dynamics without Bowen's specification property, including any transitive piecewise monotonic interval map, some coded shifts and multidimensional $\beta$-transformations.

We also consider the variations in data when the parameter of the system is varying due to internal or intrinsic perturbations but at a time scale much slower than that of the dynamics. In this case also, the measure LD and its standard deviation correctly detect transition points in the underlying dynamics of the system. The computation of LD requires minimal computing resources and time, and works well with short data sets. Hence, we propose this measure as a tool to track transitions in dynamics from data, facilitating quicker and more effective analysis of large number of data sets.">

        <tr id="We explore the time evolution of a topological system when the system undergoes a sudden quantum quench within the same nontrivial phase. Using Haldane's honeycomb model as an example, we show that equilibrium states in a topological phase can be distinguished by geometrical features, such as the characteristic momentum at which the half-occupied edge modes cross, the associated edge-mode velocity, and the winding vector about which the normalized pseudospin magnetic field winds along a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We generalize these geometrical quantities for non-equilibrium states and use them to visualize the quench dynamics of the topological system. In general, we find the pre-quench equilibrium state relaxes to the post-quench equilibrium state in an oscillatory fashion, whose amplitude decay as $t^{1/2}$. In the process, however, the characteristic winding vector of the non-equilibrium system can evolve to regimes that are not reachable with equilibrium states.">

        <tr id="Parameter estimation is one of the central problems in computational modeling of biological systems. Typically, scientists must fully specify the mathematical structure of the model, often expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations, to estimate the parameters. This process poses significant challenges due to the necessity for a detailed understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating model parameters and assessing their identifiability in situations where only partial knowledge of the system structure is available. The partially known model is extended into a system of Hybrid Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, which captures the unknown portions of the system using neural networks. Integrating neural networks into the model structure introduces two primary challenges for parameter estimation: the need to globally explore the search space while employing gradient-based optimization, and the assessment of parameter identifiability, which may be hindered by the expressive nature of neural networks. To overcome the first issue, we treat biological parameters as hyperparameters in the extended model, exploring the parameter search space during hyperparameter tuning. The second issue is then addressed by an a posteriori analysis of parameter identifiability, computed by introducing a variant of a well-established approach for mechanistic models. These two components are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that is thoroughly described in the paper. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on test cases derived from three different benchmark models. These test cases have been designed to mimic real-world conditions, including the presence of noise in the training data and various levels of data availability for the system variables. Author summary Parameter estimation is a central challenge in modeling biological systems. Typically, scientists calibrate the parameters by aligning model predictions with measured data once the model structure is defined. Our paper introduces a workflow that leverages the integration between mechanistic modeling and machine learning to estimate model parameters when the model structure is not fully known. We focus mainly on analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters, which measures how confident we can be in the parameter estimates given the available experimental data and partial mechanistic understanding of the system. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach in various in silico scenarios. Our workflow represents a first step to adapting traditional methods used in fully mechanistic models to the scenario of hybrid modeling.">

To find a proper state space model, an iterative strategy is presented expanding an initial solution in every step. Harnessing only the measurement data and not their time derivatives a criterion is proposed to select promising extensions to the model avoiding extensive simulation studies on possible model structures.

The proposed control method incorporates a Universal Self-Learning module, which introduces a model-free online executor-evaluator framework to enable controller adaptation in the presence of unknown disturbances. By leveraging a neural network model trained on historical system performance data, the controller can autonomously learn to approximate optimal performance during each learning cycle. Consequently, the controller's structural parameters are incrementally adjusted to achieve a performance threshold comparable to human-level performance. Utilizing nonlinear system stability theory, specifically in the context of three-dimensional manifold space, we demonstrate the stability of USLC in Lipschitz continuous systems. We illustrate the USLC framework numerically with two case studies: a low-order circuit system and a high-order morphing fixed-wing attitude control system. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and universality of the proposed method.">

        <tr id="Generally, discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) creates a sequence of linear systems $A_k x_k = b_k, k = 0, 1, 2, ..., N$ with well-known and structured sparsity patterns. Preconditioners are often necessary to achieve fast convergence When solving these linear systems using iterative solvers. We can use preconditioner updates for closely related systems instead of computing a preconditioner for each system from scratch. One such preconditioner update is the sparse approximate map (SAM), which is based on the sparse approximate inverse preconditioner using a least squares approximation. A SAM then acts as a map from one matrix in the sequence to another nearby one for which we have an effective preconditioner. To efficiently compute an effective SAM update (i.e., one that facilitates fast convergence of the iterative solver), we seek to compute an optimal sparsity pattern. In this paper, we examine several sparsity patterns for computing the SAM update to characterize optimal or near-optimal sparsity patterns for linear systems arising from discretized PDEs.">

        <tr id="Quantitative models that describe how biological sequences encode functional activities are ubiquitous in modern biology. One important aspect of these models is that they commonly exhibit gauge freedoms, i.e., directions in parameter space that do not affect model predictions. In physics, gauge freedoms arise when physical theories are formulated in ways that respect fundamental symmetries. However, the connections that gauge freedoms in models of sequence-function relationships have to the symmetries of sequence space have yet to be systematically studied. Here we study the gauge freedoms of models that respect a specific symmetry of sequence space: the group of position-specific character permutations. We find that gauge freedoms arise when model parameters transform under redundant irreducible matrix representations of this group. Based on this finding, we describe an “embedding distillation” procedure that enables analytic calculation of the number of independent gauge freedoms, as well as efficient computation of a sparse basis for the space of gauge freedoms. We also study how parameter transformation behavior affects parameter interpretability. We find that in many (and possibly all) nontrivial models, the ability to interpret individual model parameters as quantifying intrinsic allelic effects requires that gauge freedoms be present. This finding establishes an incompatibility between two distinct notions of parameter interpretability. Our work thus advances the understanding of symmetries, gauge freedoms, and parameter interpretability in sequence-function relationships. Significance Statement Gauge freedoms—diections in parameter space that do not affect model predictions—are ubiquitous in mathematical models of biological sequence-function relationships. But in contrast to theoretical physics, where gauge freedoms play a central role, little is understood about the mathematical properties of gauge freedoms in models of sequence-function relationships. Here we identify a connection between specific symmetries of sequence space and the gauge freedoms present in a large class of commonly used models for sequence-function relationships. We show that this connection can be used to perform useful mathematical computations, and we discuss the impact of model transformation properties on parameter interpretability. The results fill a major gap in the understanding of quantitative sequence-function relationships.">

Additionally, a new parameter is introduced for the construction of the quadratic terms in one of two activation functions, which further enhances the network's ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships. To address the issue of low fitting accuracy caused by the discontinuity of solution's derivative, a piecewise fitting approach is proposed by dividing the global solving domain into several subdomains. The convergence of the loss function is proven.

This paper distinguishes between two types of uncertainty within the posteriors of GP dynamical models: the well-documented mathematical uncertainty stemming from limited data and computational uncertainty arising from constrained computational capabilities, which has been largely overlooked in prior research. Our work demonstrates that computational uncertainty, quantified through a probabilistic approximation of the inverse covariance matrix in GP dynamical models, is essential for stable control under computational constraints. We show that incorporating computational uncertainty can prevent overestimating the region of attraction, a safe subset of the state space with asymptotic stability, thus improving system safety. Building on these insights, we propose an innovative controller design methodology that integrates computational uncertainty within a second-order cone programming framework. Simulations of canonical stable control tasks and experiments of quadrotor tracking exhibit the effectiveness of our method under computational constraints.">

In this article, we rather study regression trees applied to well-behaved, differentiable functions, and determine the relationship between node parameters and the local gradient of the function being approximated. We find a simple estimate of the gradient which can be efficiently computed using quantities exposed by popular tree learning libraries. This allows the tools developed in the context of differentiable algorithms, like neural nets and Gaussian processes, to be deployed to tree-based models. To demonstrate this, we study measures of model sensitivity defined in terms of integrals of gradients and demonstrate how to compute them for regression trees using the proposed gradient estimates. Quantitative and qualitative numerical experiments reveal the capability of gradients estimated by regression trees to improve predictive analysis, solve tasks in uncertainty quantification, and provide interpretation of model behavior.">

In this paper, we propose an inference methodology for classical Kirchhoff-Love plates via physics-informed Gaussian Processes (GP). A probabilistic model is formulated as a multi-output GP by placing a GP prior on the deflection and deriving the covariance function using the linear differential operators of the plate governing equations. The posteriors of the flexural rigidity, hyperparameters, and plate response are inferred in a Bayesian manner using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from noisy measurements. We demonstrate the applicability with two examples: a simply supported plate subjected to a sinusoidal load and a fixed plate subjected to a uniform load. The results illustrate how the proposed methodology can be employed to perform stochastic inference for plate rigidity and physical quantities by integrating measurements from various sensor types and qualities. Potential applications of the presented methodology are in structural health monitoring and uncertainty quantification of plate-like structures.">

SPC integrates deep convolutional neural networks with physics-constrained methods based on the Euler equation to derive a new loss function that can accurately calculate the flow fields by considering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow fields at the previous moment. Compared to purely data-driven methods, SPC significantly reduces the dependency on training data volume by incorporating physical constraints. Additionally, the training process of SPC is more stable than that of data-driven methods. Taking the classic supersonic forward step flow as an example, SPC can accurately calculate strong discontinuities in the flow fields, while reducing the data volume by approximately 60%. In the generalization test experiment for forward step flow and compression ramp flow, SPC also demonstrates good predictive accuracy and generalization capability under different geometric configurations and inflow conditions.">

The key behind our approach is to connect the system under study to a positive nonlinear system through a “change of variables”. The positive invariance of the first orthant (Math 1) for a positive system guarantees, in turn, that the functions involved in the change of variables define a positive invariant for the original system. The challenge lies in discovering such functions for a given system. To this end, we characterize positive invariants as fixed points under an operator that is defined using the Lie derivative. Next, we use abstract-interpretation approaches to systematically compute this fixed point. Whereas abstract interpretation has been applied to the static analysis of programs, and invariant synthesis for hybrid systems to a limited extent, we show how these approaches can compute fixed points over cones generated by polynomials using sum-of-squares optimization and its relaxations. Our approach is shown to be promising over a set of small but hard-to-analyze nonlinear models, wherein it is able to generate positive invariants to place useful bounds on their reachable sets.">
