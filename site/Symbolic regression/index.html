        <tr id="Significance Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.">

        <tr id="Significance Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science. The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.">

        <tr id="Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.">

        <tr id="Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.">

        <tr id="Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.">

        <tr id="A key task in the field of modeling and analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems is the recovery of unknown governing equations from measurement data only. There is a wide range of application areas for this important instance of system identification, ranging from industrial engineering and acoustic signal processing to stock market models. In order to find appropriate representations of underlying dynamical systems, various data-driven methods have been proposed by different communities. However, if the given data sets are high-dimensional, then these methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To significantly reduce the computational costs and storage consumption, we propose the method multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems (MANDy) which combines data-driven methods with tensor network decompositions. The efficiency of the introduced approach will be illustrated with the aid of several high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="First principles modeling of physical systems has led to significant technological advances across all branches of science. For nonlinear systems, however, small modeling errors can lead to significant deviations from the true, measured behavior. Even in mechanical systems, where the equations are assumed to be well-known, there are often model discrepancies corresponding to nonlinear friction, wind resistance, etc. Discovering models for these discrepancies remains an open challenge for many complex systems. In this work, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to discover a model for the discrepancy between a simplified model and measurement data. In particular, we assume that the model mismatch can be sparsely represented in a library of candidate model terms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several examples including experimental data from a double pendulum on a cart. We further design and implement a feed-forward controller in simulations, showing improvement with a discrepancy model.">

However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further modification.">

        <tr id="Researchers propose sparse regression for identifying governing partial differential equations for spatiotemporal systems. We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.">

        <tr id="Sparse model identification enables the discovery of nonlinear dynamical systems purely from data; however, this approach is sensitive to noise, especially in the low-data limit. In this work, we leverage the statistical approach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to several synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate substantial improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected from 1900 to 1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be exploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.">

Sparse regression, in particular, has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: 1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning; 2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations; and 3) the methods apply to composite regularizers, essential for total variation (TV) as well as sparsity-promoting formulations using tight frames. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, and greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. Following standards of reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.">

However, it encounters challenges when modeling complex dynamical systems involving high-order derivatives or discontinuities, particularly in the presence of noise. These limitations restrict its applicability across various fields in applied mathematics and physics. To mitigate these, we propose Laplace-Enhanced SparSe Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (LES-SINDy). By transforming time-series measurements from the time domain to the Laplace domain using the Laplace transform and integration by parts, LES-SINDy enables more accurate approximations of derivatives and discontinuous terms. It also effectively handles unbounded growth functions and accumulated numerical errors in the Laplace domain, thereby overcoming challenges in the identification process. The model evaluation process selects the most accurate and parsimonious dynamical systems from multiple candidates. Experimental results across diverse ordinary and partial differential equations show that LES-SINDy achieves superior robustness, accuracy, and parsimony compared to existing methods.">

        <tr id="Effectively controlling systems governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is crucial in several fields of Applied Sciences and Engineering. These systems usually yield significant challenges to conventional control schemes due to their nonlinear dynamics, partial observability, high-dimensionality once discretized, distributed nature, and the requirement for low-latency feedback control. Reinforcement Learning (RL), particularly Deep RL (DRL), has recently emerged as a promising control paradigm for such systems, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in managing high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics. However, DRL faces challenges including sample inefficiency, robustness issues, and an overall lack of interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a data-efficient, interpretable, and scalable Dyna-style Model-Based RL framework for PDE control, combining the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Control (SINDy-C) algorithm and an autoencoder (AE) framework for the sake of dimensionality reduction of PDE states and actions. This novel approach enables fast rollouts, reducing the need for extensive environment interactions, and provides an interpretable latent space representation of the PDE forward dynamics. We validate our method on two PDE problems describing fluid flows - namely, the 1D Burgers equation and 2D Navier-Stokes equations - comparing it against a model-free baseline, and carrying out an extensive analysis of the learned dynamics.">

Machine learning has exhibited great success in learn and predicting dynamical systems from data. However, the fundamental challenges still exist: discovering the exact governing equations from highly noisy data. In the present work, we propose a compressive sensing‐assisted mixed integer optimization (CS‐MIO) method to make a step forward from a modern discrete optimization lens. In particular, we first formulate the problem into a mixed integer optimization model. The discrete optimization nature of the model leads to exact variable selection by means of cardinality constraint, and thereby powerful capability of exact discovery of governing equations from noisy data. Such capability is further enhanced by incorporating compressive sensing and regularization techniques for highly noisy data and high‐dimensional problems. The case studies on classical dynamical systems have shown that CS‐MIO can discover the exact governing equations from large‐noise data, with up to two orders of magnitude larger noise compared with state‐of‐the‐art methods. We also show its effectiveness for high‐dimensional dynamical system identification through the chaotic Lorenz 96 system.">

The main approach is to propose polynomial equations with unknown coefficients, and subsequently perform a parametric estimation using genetic algorithms. Some of the main contributions of the present study are an adequate modification of the genetic algorithm to remove terms with minimal contributions, and a mechanism to escape local optima during the search. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it to three dynamical systems: a linear model, a nonlinear model, and the Lorenz system.

However, determining an appropriate model structure and its parameters is often complex and highly uncertain. A promising alternative is to learn the model structure directly from time series data of both predator and prey. This study explores the capability of a data-driven algorithm, Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), to accurately capture the dynamics of a predator-prey system. We apply SINDy to derive a Learned Model (LM) from data generated by a Reference Model (RM), whose predator-prey dynamics are well understood. The study compares the dynamics of the LM to the RM using criteria such as equilibrium points, stability, sensitivity, and bifurcation analysis. Our results demonstrate general consistency between the RM and LM dynamics, though notable differences remain.

        <tr id="We propose the use of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for online data assimilation and update of a dynamic model, preliminary identified through the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). This data-driven technique may avoid biases due to incorrect modelling assumptions and exploits SINDy to approximate the system dynamics leveraging a predefined library of functions, where active terms are selected and weighted by a sparse set of coefficients. This results in a physically-sound and interpretable dynamic model allowing to reduce epistemic uncertainty often affecting machine learning approaches. Treating the SINDy model coefficients as random variables, we propose to update them while acquiring (possibly noisy) system measurements, thus enabling the online identification of time-varying systems. These changes can stem from, e.g., varying operational conditions or unforeseen events. The EKF performs model adaptation through joint state-parameters estimation, with the Jacobian matrices required to computed the model sensitivity inexpensively evaluated from the SINDy model formulation. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through three case studies: (i) a Lokta-Volterra model in which all parameters simultaneously evolve during the observation period; (ii) a Selkov model where the system undergoes a bifurcation not seen during the SINDy training; (iii) a MEMS arch exhibiting a 1:2 internal resonance. The ability of EKF of recovering inactivated functional terms from the SINDy library, or discarding unnecessary contribution, is also highlighted. Based on the presented applications, this method shows strong promise for handling time-varying nonlinear dynamic systems possibly experiencing bifurcating behaviours.">

        <tr id="This work explores the relationship between state space methods and Koopman operator-based methods for predicting the time-evolution of nonlinear dynamical systems. We demonstrate that extended dynamic mode decomposition with dictionary learning (EDMD-DL), when combined with a state space projection, is equivalent to a neural network representation of the nonlinear discrete-time flow map on the state space. We highlight how this projection step introduces nonlinearity into the evolution equations, enabling significantly improved EDMD-DL predictions. With this projection, EDMD-DL leads to a nonlinear dynamical system on the state space, which can be represented in either discrete or continuous time. This system has a natural structure for neural networks, where the state is first expanded into a high dimensional feature space followed by a linear mapping which represents the discrete-time map or the vector field as a linear combination of these features. Inspired by these observations, we implement several variations of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and EDMD-DL, developed by combining different aspects of their respective model structures and training procedures. We evaluate these methods using numerical experiments on chaotic dynamics in the Lorenz system and a nine-mode model of turbulent shear flow, showing comparable performance across methods in terms of short-time trajectory prediction, reconstruction of long-time statistics, and prediction of rare events. We also show that these methods provide comparable performance to a non-Markovian approach in terms of prediction of extreme events.">

        <tr id="Model reduction is a key technology for large-scale physical systems in science and engineering, as it brings behavior expressed in many degrees of freedom to a more manageable size that subsequently allows control, optimization, and analysis with multi-query algorithms. We introduce an enhanced regression technique tailored to uncover quadratic parametric reduced-order dynamical systems from data. Our method, termed Improved Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics (I-GILD), refines the learning phase of the original GILD approach. This refinement is achieved by reorganizing the quadratic model coefficients, allowing the minimum-residual problem to be reformulated using the Frobenius norm. Consequently, the optimality conditions lead to a generalized Sylvester equation, which is efficiently solved using the conjugate gradient method. Analysis of the convergence shows that I-GILD achieves superior convergence for quadratic model coefficients compared to GILD's steepest gradient descent, reducing both computational complexity and iteration count. Additionally, we derive an error bound for the model predictions, offering insights into error growth in time and ensuring controlled accuracy as long as the magnitudes of initial error is small and learning residuals are well minimized. The efficacy of I-GILD is demonstrated through its application to numerical and experimental tests, specifically the flow past Ahmed body with a variable rear slant angle, and the lid-driven cylindrical cavity problem with variable Reynolds numbers, utilizing particle-image velocimetry (PIV) data. These tests confirm I-GILD's ability to treat real-world dynamical system challenges and produce effective reduced-order models.">

        <tr id="Motivated by the surge of interest in Koopman operator theory, we propose a machine-learning alternative based on a functional Bayesian perspective for operator-theoretic modeling of unknown, data-driven, nonlinear dynamical systems. This formulation is directly done in an infinite-dimensional space of linear operators or Hilbert space with universal approximation property. The theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) allows the lifting of nonlinear dynamics to a potentially infinite-dimensional space via linear embeddings, where a general nonlinear function is represented as a set of linear functions or operators in the functional space. This allows us to apply classical linear Bayesian methods such as the Kalman filter directly in the Hilbert space, yielding nonlinear solutions in the original input space. This kernel perspective on the Koopman operator offers two compelling advantages. First, the Hilbert space can be constructed deterministically, agnostic to the nonlinear dynamics. The Gaussian kernel is universal, approximating uniformly an arbitrary continuous target function over any compact domain. Second, Bayesian filter is an adaptive, linear minimum-variance algorithm, allowing the system to update the Koopman operator and continuously track the changes across an extended period of time, ideally suited for modern data-driven applications such as real-time machine learning using streaming data. In this paper, we present several practical implementations to obtain a finite-dimensional approximation of the functional Bayesian filter (FBF). Due to the rapid decay of the Gaussian kernel, excellent approximation is obtained with a small dimension. We demonstrate that this practical approach can obtain accurate results and outperform finite-dimensional Koopman decomposition.">

        <tr id="System identification, the process of deriving mathematical models of dynamical systems from observed input-output data, has undergone a paradigm shift with the advent of learning-based methods. Addressing the intricate challenges of data-driven discovery in nonlinear dynamical systems, these methods have garnered significant attention. Among them, Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) has emerged as a transformative approach, distilling complex dynamical behaviors into interpretable linear combinations of basis functions. However, SINDy relies on domain-specific expertise to construct its foundational"library"of basis functions, which limits its adaptability and universality. In this work, we introduce a nonlinear system identification framework called LeARN that transcends the need for prior domain knowledge by learning the library of basis functions directly from data. To enhance adaptability to evolving system dynamics under varying noise conditions, we employ a novel meta-learning-based system identification approach that uses a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) to dynamically refine these basis functions. This not only captures intricate system behaviors but also adapts seamlessly to new dynamical regimes. We validate our framework on the Neural Fly dataset, showcasing its robust adaptation and generalization capabilities. Despite its simplicity, our LeARN achieves competitive dynamical error performance compared to SINDy. This work presents a step toward the autonomous discovery of dynamical systems, paving the way for a future where machine learning uncovers the governing principles of complex systems without requiring extensive domain-specific interventions.">

        <tr id="In applications, an anticipated situation is where the system of interest has never been encountered before and sparse observations can be made only once. Can the dynamics be faithfully reconstructed from the limited observations without any training data? This problem defies any known traditional methods of nonlinear time-series analysis as well as existing machine-learning methods that typically require extensive data from the target system for training. We address this challenge by developing a hybrid transformer and reservoir-computing machine-learning scheme. The key idea is that, for a complex and nonlinear target system, the training of the transformer can be conducted not using any data from the target system, but with essentially unlimited synthetic data from known chaotic systems. The trained transformer is then tested with the sparse data from the target system. The output of the transformer is further fed into a reservoir computer for predicting the long-term dynamics or the attractor of the target system. The power of the proposed hybrid machine-learning framework is demonstrated using a large number of prototypical nonlinear dynamical systems, with high reconstruction accuracy even when the available data is only 20% of that required to faithfully represent the dynamical behavior of the underlying system. The framework provides a paradigm of reconstructing complex and nonlinear dynamics in the extreme situation where training data does not exist and the observations are random and sparse.">

Our framework applies deep neural networks as surrogate models for denoising and reconstructing sparse and noisy observations while using Gaussian-Jacobi quadrature to handle the challenges posed by singularities in fractional derivatives. To optimize both the sparse coefficients and fractional order, we employ an alternating optimization approach that combines sparse regression with global optimization techniques.

        <tr id="Data-Driven Response Regime Exploration and Identification (DR2EI) is a novel and fully data-driven method for identifying and classifying response regimes of a dynamical system without requiring human intervention. This approach is a valuable tool for exploring and discovering response regimes in complex dynamical systems, especially when the governing equations and the number of distinct response regimes are unknown, and the system is expensive to sample. Additionally, the method is useful for order reduction, as it can be used to identify the most dominant response regimes of a given dynamical system. DR2EI utilizes unsupervised learning algorithms to transform the system's response into an embedding space that facilitates regime classification. An active sequential sampling approach based on Gaussian Process Regression is used to efficiently sample the parameter space, quantify uncertainty, and provide optimal trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. The performance of the DR2EI method was evaluated by analyzing three established dynamical systems: the mathematical pendulum, the Lorenz system, and the Duffing oscillator, and its robustness to noise was validated across a range of noise magnitudes. The method was shown to effectively identify a variety of response regimes with both similar and distinct topological features and frequency content, demonstrating its versatility in capturing a wide range of behaviors. While it may not be possible to guarantee that all possible regimes will be identified, the method provides an automated and efficient means for exploring the parameter space of a dynamical system and identifying its underlying "sufficiently dominant" response regimes without prior knowledge of the system's equations or behavior.">

        <tr id="Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years for identifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an infinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability guarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under conditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge within the existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and Lyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount of data sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively low sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed high-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system transitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov functions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less conservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing methods.">

The first framework integrates a popular neural operator, DeepONet, and a physics-informed neural network to capture the relationship between sparse data and the underlying physics, enabling the accurate discovery of a family of governing equations. The second framework focuses on system parameter identification, leveraging a DeepONet pre-trained on sparse sensor measurements to initialize a physics-constrained inverse model. Both frameworks excel in handling limited data and preserving physical consistency. Benchmarking on the Burgers' equation and reaction-diffusion system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving average $L_2$ errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ for hidden physics discovery and absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ for parameter identification.

However, real-world applications often present challenges such as the unknown dimensionality of the system and limited access to measurements, particularly in partially observed systems.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have made significant strides in modeling dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their generalization capabilities across varying scenarios remain limited. To overcome this limitation, we propose PIDO, a novel physics-informed neural PDE solver designed to generalize effectively across diverse PDE configurations, including varying initial conditions, PDE coefficients, and training time horizons. PIDO exploits the shared underlying structure of dynamical systems with different properties by projecting PDE solutions into a latent space using auto-decoding. It then learns the dynamics of these latent representations, conditioned on the PDE coefficients. Despite its promise, integrating latent dynamics models within a physics-informed framework poses challenges due to the optimization difficulties associated with physics-informed losses. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach that diagnoses and mitigates these issues within the latent space. This strategy employs straightforward yet effective regularization techniques, enhancing both the temporal extrapolation performance and the training stability of PIDO. We validate PIDO on a range of benchmarks, including 1D combined equations and 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we demonstrate the transferability of its learned representations to downstream applications such as long-term integration and inverse problems.">

To bridge this gap, we investigate hybrid reservoir computing, combining reservoir computing with"expert"analytical models. Simulating the absence of an exact model, we first test the surrogate models with parameter errors in their expert model. Second, we assess their performance when their expert model lacks key non-linear coupling terms present in an extended ground-truth model. We focus on short-term forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes, evaluating the use of these surrogates for control applications. We show that hybrid reservoir computers generally outperform standard reservoir computers and exhibit greater robustness to parameter tuning. Notably, unlike standard reservoir computers, the performance of the hybrid does not degrade when crossing an observed spectral radius threshold. Furthermore, there is good performance for dynamical regimes not accessible to the expert model, demonstrating the contribution of the reservoir.">

Such nontrivial wave responses can be exploited to design sound-focusing/scrambling devices, acoustic filters, and analog computational units. At high amplitude vibrations or low confinement pressures, the effect of nonlinear particle contacts becomes increasingly noticeable, and the interplay of nonlinearity, disorder, and discreteness in the system gives rise to remarkable properties, particularly useful in designing structures with exotic properties. In this paper, we build upon the data-driven methods in dynamical system analysis and show that the Koopman spectral theory can be applied to granular crystals, enabling their phase space analysis beyond the linearizable regime and without recourse to any approximations considered in the previous works. We show that a deep neural network can map the dynamics to a latent space where the essential nonlinearity of the granular system unfolds into a high-dimensional linear space. As a proof of concept, we use data from numerical simulations of a two-particle system and evaluate the accuracy of the trajectory predictions under various initial conditions. By incorporating data from experimental measurements, our proposed framework can directly capture the underlying dynamics without imposing any assumptions about the physics model. Spectral analysis of the trained surrogate system can help bridge the gap between the simulation results and the physical realization of granular crystals and facilitate the inverse design of materials with desired behaviors.">

Traditional feedback control design that relies on full-order models, such as high-dimensional state-space representations or partial differential equations, fails to meet these requirements due to the delay in the control computation, which requires multiple expensive simulations of the physical system. The computational bottleneck is even more severe when considering parametrized systems, as new strategies have to be determined for every new scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time closed-loop control strategy enhanced by nonlinear non-intrusive Deep Learning-based Reduced Order Models (DL-ROMs). Specifically, in the offline phase, (i) full-order state-control pairs are generated for different scenarios through the adjoint method, (ii) the essential features relevant for control design are extracted from the snapshots through a combination of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and deep autoencoders, and (iii) the low-dimensional policy bridging latent control and state spaces is approximated with a feedforward neural network. After data generation and neural networks training, the optimal control actions are retrieved in real-time for any observed state and scenario. In addition, the dynamics may be approximated through a cheap surrogate model in order to close the loop at the latent level, thus continuously controlling the system in real-time even when full-order state measurements are missing. The effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of computational speed, accuracy, and robustness against noisy data, is finally assessed on two different high-dimensional optimal transport problems, one of which also involving an underlying fluid flow.">

These challenges often cause identifiability issues and can confound model parameter initialization, both of which can lead to estimated models with unrealistic qualitative dynamics and induce deeper parameter estimation errors. The proposed methodology's objective function is constructed as a sum of components, each serving a different purpose: enforcing point-wise and distribution-wise agreement between data and model output, enforcing agreement of variables and parameters with a model provided, and penalizing unrealistic rapid parameter changes, unless they are due to external drivers or interventions. This methodology was motivated by, developed and evaluated in the context of estimating blood glucose levels in different medical settings. Both simulated and real data are used to evaluate the methodology from different perspectives, such as its ability to estimate unmeasured variables, its ability to reproduce the correct qualitative blood glucose dynamics, how it manages known non-stationarity, and how it performs when given a range of dense and severely sparse data. The results show that a multicomponent cost function can balance the minimization of point-wise errors with global properties, robustly preserving correct qualitative dynamics and managing data sparsity.">

        <tr id="Differential equations offer a foundational yet powerful framework for modeling interactions within complex dynamic systems and are widely applied across numerous scientific fields. One common challenge in this area is estimating the unknown parameters of these dynamic relationships. However, traditional numerical optimization methods rely on the selection of initial parameter values, making them prone to local optima. Meanwhile, deep learning and Bayesian methods require training models on specific differential equations, resulting in poor versatility. This paper reformulates the parameter estimation problem of differential equations as an optimization problem by introducing the concept of particles from the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Building on reinforcement learning-based particle swarm optimization (RLLPSO), this paper proposes a novel method, DERLPSO, for estimating unknown parameters of differential equations. We compared its performance on three typical ordinary differential equations with the state-of-the-art methods, including the RLLPSO algorithm, traditional numerical methods, deep learning approaches, and Bayesian methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our DERLPSO consistently outperforms other methods in terms of performance, achieving an average Mean Square Error of 1.13e-05, which reduces the error by approximately 4 orders of magnitude compared to other methods. Apart from ordinary differential equations, our DERLPSO also show great promise for estimating unknown parameters of partial differential equations. The DERLPSO method proposed in this paper has high accuracy, is independent of initial parameter values, and possesses strong versatility and stability. This work provides new insights into unknown parameter estimation for differential equations.">

In tests on several challenging examples, including chaotic dynamical systems and state-of-the-art power grid models, PNDEs outperform existing methods while requiring fewer hyperparameters.

        <tr id="When solving partial differential equations (PDEs), classical numerical methods often require fine mesh grids and small time stepping to meet stability, consistency, and convergence conditions, leading to high computational cost. Recently, machine learning has been increasingly utilized to solve PDE problems, but they often encounter challenges related to interpretability, generalizability, and strong dependency on rich labeled data. Hence, we introduce a new PDE-Preserved Coarse Correction Network (P$^2$C$^2$Net) to efficiently solve spatiotemporal PDE problems on coarse mesh grids in small data regimes. The model consists of two synergistic modules: (1) a trainable PDE block that learns to update the coarse solution (i.e., the system state), based on a high-order numerical scheme with boundary condition encoding, and (2) a neural network block that consistently corrects the solution on the fly. In particular, we propose a learnable symmetric Conv filter, with weights shared over the entire model, to accurately estimate the spatial derivatives of PDE based on the neural-corrected system state. The resulting physics-encoded model is capable of handling limited training data (e.g., 3--5 trajectories) and accelerates the prediction of PDE solutions on coarse spatiotemporal grids while maintaining a high accuracy. P$^2$C$^2$Net achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance with over 50\% gain (e.g., in terms of relative prediction error) across four datasets covering complex reaction-diffusion processes and turbulent flows.">

        <tr id="A semigroup characterization, or equivalently, a characterization by the generator, is a classical technique used to describe continuous-time nonlinear dynamical systems. In the realm of data-driven learning for an unknown nonlinear system, one must estimate the generator of the semigroup of the system's transfer operators (also known as the semigroup of Koopman operators) based on discrete-time observations and verify convergence to the true generator in an appropriate sense. As the generator encodes essential transient transitional information of the system, challenges arise for some existing methods that rely on accurately estimating the time derivatives of the state with constraints on the observation rate. Recent literature develops a technique that avoids the use of time derivatives by employing the logarithm of a Koopman operator. However, the validity of this method has been demonstrated only within a restrictive function space and requires knowledge of the operator's spectral properties. In this paper, we propose a resolvent-type method for learning the system generator to relax the requirements on the observation frequency and overcome the constraints of taking operator logarithms. We also provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness in applications of system identification and constructing Lyapunov functions.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces an online approach for identifying time-varying subspaces defined by linear dynamical systems, leveraging optimization on the Grassmannian manifold leading to the Grassmannian Recursive Algorithm for Tracking (GREAT) method. The approach of representing linear systems by non-parametric subspace models has received significant interest in the field of data-driven control recently. We view subspaces as points on the Grassmannian manifold, and therefore, tracking is achieved by performing optimization on the manifold. At each time step, a single measurement from the current subspace corrupted by a bounded error is available. The subspace estimate is updated online using Grassmannian gradient descent on a cost function incorporating a window of the most recent data. Under suitable assumptions on the signal-to-noise ratio of the online data and the subspace's rate of change, we establish theoretical guarantees for the resulting algorithm. More specifically, we prove an exponential convergence rate and provide a consistent uncertainty quantification of the estimates in terms of an upper bound on their distance to the true subspace. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by means of numerical examples, and it is shown to compare favorably with competing parametric system identification methods.">

        <tr id="Prediction of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is crucial across various fields, requiring extensive high-fidelity data. However, experimental data are often sparse and noisy, while simulated data may lack credibility due to discrepancies with real-world configurations and parameters. This underscores the need for field reconstruction and parameter inference from sparse, noisy data, which constitutes inverse problems. Based on the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the KH-PINN framework is established in this work to solve the inverse problems of KHI flows. By incorporating the governing physical equations, KH-PINN reconstructs continuous flow fields and infer unknown transport parameters from sparse, noisy observed data. The 2D unsteady incompressible flows with both constant and variable densities are studied. To our knowledge, this is the first application of PINNs to unsteady incompressible flows with variable densities. To address the spatiotemporal multiscale issue and enhance the reconstruction accuracy of small-scale structures, the multiscale embedding (ME) strategy is adopted. To address the magnitude multiscale issue and enhance the reconstruction accuracy of small-magnitude velocities, which are critical for KHI problems, the small-velocity amplification (SVA) strategy is proposed. The results demonstrate that KH-PINN can accurately reconstruct the fields with complex, evolving vortices and infer unknown parameters across a broad range of Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the energy-decaying and entropy-increasing curves are accurately obtained. The effectiveness of ME and SVA is validated through comparative studies, and the anti-noise and few-shot learning capabilities of KH-PINN are also validated.

The Lotka-Volterra model is critical for understanding ecological dynamics, population control, and species interactions, as it is represented by a system of differential equations. In this work, we aim to uncover the underlying differential equations without prior knowledge of the system, relying solely on training data and neural networks. Using robust modeling in the Julia programming language, we demonstrate that both Neural ODEs and UDEs can be effectively utilized for prediction and forecasting of the Lotka-Volterra system. More importantly, we introduce the forecasting breakdown point: the time at which forecasting fails for both Neural ODEs and UDEs. We observe how UDEs outperform Neural ODEs by effectively recovering the underlying dynamics and achieving accurate forecasting with significantly less training data. Additionally, we introduce Gaussian noise of varying magnitudes (from mild to high) to simulate real-world data perturbations and show that UDEs exhibit superior robustness, effectively recovering the underlying dynamics even in the presence of noisy data, while Neural ODEs struggle with high levels of noise. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we offer insights into neural network architectures, activation functions, and optimizers that yield the best results. This study opens the door to applying Scientific Machine Learning frameworks for forecasting tasks across a wide range of ecological and scientific domains.">

Cleverly applied sensor motion can be exploited to enrich the quality of sensory data and improve estimation. However, a major barrier to modeling such active sensing problems is the lack of empirical, yet rigorous, tools for quantifying the relationship between movement and estimation performance. Here, we introduce “BOUNDS: Bounding Observability for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamic Systems”. BOUNDS can discover patterns of sensor motion that increase information and reduce uncertainty in either real or simulated data. Crucially, it is suitable for high dimensional and partially observable nonlinear systems with sensor noise. We demonstrate BOUNDS through a case study on how flying insects estimate wind properties, showing that specific active sensing motifs improve estimation. Additionally, we present a framework to refine sporadic estimates from active sensing. When combined with an artificial neural network, we show that the information gained via active sensing in real Drosophila flight trajectories is suitable for precise wind direction estimation. Collectively, our work will help decode active sensing in organisms and inform the design of estimation algorithms for machines.">

        <tr id="The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is an innovative approach to solve a diverse array of partial differential equations (PDEs) leveraging the power of neural networks. This is achieved by minimizing the residual loss associated with the explicit physical information, usually coupled with data derived from initial and boundary conditions. However, a challenge arises in the context of nonlinear conservation laws where derivatives are undefined at shocks, leading to solutions that deviate from the true physical phenomena. To solve this issue, the physical solution must be extracted from the weak formulation of the PDE and is typically further bounded by entropy conditions. Within the numerical framework, finite volume methods (FVM) are employed to address conservation laws. These methods resolve the integral form of conservation laws and delineate the shock characteristics. Inspired by the principles underlying FVM, this paper introduces a novel Coupled Integrated PINN methodology that involves fitting the integral solutions of equations using additional neural networks. This technique not only augments the conventional PINN's capability in modeling shock waves, but also eliminates the need for spatial and temporal discretization. As such, it bypasses the complexities of numerical integration and reconstruction associated with non-convex fluxes. Finally, we show that the proposed new Integrated PINN performs well in conservative law and outperforms the vanilla PINN when tackle the challenging shock problems using examples of Burger's equation, Buckley-Leverett Equation and Euler System.">

For bounded uncertainties, we apply robust control techniques to derive a guaranteed upper bound on the H2-norm of the unknown true system. To this end, a single semidefinite program (SDP) needs to be solved, with complexity that is independent of the amount of data. Furthermore, we exploit the signal-to-noise ratio to provide a data-dependent condition, that characterizes whether the proposed parametrization can be employed. The modular formulation allows to extend this framework to controller synthesis with different performance criteria, input-output settings, and various system properties.

They have advantages in learning and understanding the evolution of complex real dynamics. Many previous works have focused on NODEs in concise forms, while numerous physical systems taking straightforward forms, in fact, belong to their more complex quasi-classes, thus appealing to a class of general NODEs with high scalability and flexibility to model those systems. This, however, may result in intricate nonlinear properties. In this paper, we introduce ControlSynth Neural ODEs (CSODEs). We show that despite their highly nonlinear nature, convergence can be guaranteed via tractable linear inequalities. In the composition of CSODEs, we introduce an extra control term for learning the potential simultaneous capture of dynamics at different scales, which could be particularly useful for partial differential equation-formulated systems. Finally, we compare several representative NNs with CSODEs on important physical dynamics under the inductive biases of CSODEs, and illustrate that CSODEs have better learning and predictive abilities in these settings.">
