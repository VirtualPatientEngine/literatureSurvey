        <tr id="Significance Governing equations are essential to the study of physical systems, providing models that can generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors. There are many systems of interest across disciplines where large quantities of data have been collected, but the underlying governing equations remain unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover governing models from data. The proposed method addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious and interpretable governing models has the potential to transform our understanding of complex systems, including in neuroscience, biology, and climate science. The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.">

        <tr id="Machine learning models have emerged as powerful tools in physics and engineering. In this work, we use an autoencoder with latent space penalization to discover approximate finite-dimensional manifolds of two canonical partial differential equations. We test this method on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (K-S), Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), and damped KdV equations. We show that the resulting optimal latent space of the K-S equation is consistent with the dimension of the inertial manifold. We then uncover a nonlinear basis representing the manifold of the latent space for the K-S equation. The results for the KdV equation show that it is more difficult to recover a reduced latent space, which is consistent with the truly infinite-dimensional dynamics of the KdV equation. In the case of the damped KdV equation, we find that the number of active dimensions decreases with increasing damping coefficient.">

We learn encoders and decoders for the system states and evolution based on deep neural network architectures that include general Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transpose CNNs (T-CNNs). Motivated by problems arising in parameterized PDEs and physics, we investigate the performance of our methods on tasks for learning low dimensional representations of the nonlinear Burgers equations, constrained mechanical systems, and spatial fields of reaction-diffusion systems.

        <tr id="A long-standing problem at the interface of artificial intelligence and applied mathematics is to devise an algorithm capable of achieving human level or even superhuman proficiency in transforming observed data into predictive mathematical models of the physical world. In the current era of abundance of data and advanced machine learning capabilities, the natural question arises: How can we automatically uncover the underlying laws of physics from high-dimensional data generated from experiments? In this work, we put forth a deep learning approach for discovering nonlinear partial differential equations from scattered and potentially noisy observations in space and time. Specifically, we approximate the unknown solution as well as the nonlinear dynamics by two deep neural networks. The first network acts as a prior on the unknown solution and essentially enables us to avoid numerical differentiations which are inherently ill-conditioned and unstable. The second network represents the nonlinear dynamics and helps us distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given spatiotemporal data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems spanning a number of scientific domains and demonstrate how the proposed framework can help us accurately learn the underlying dynamics and forecast future states of the system. In particular, we study the Burgers', Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger, and Navier-Stokes equations.">

We wish to promote the (internal) symmetry as a new desirable property for a neural network, and to draw attention to the PDE perspective in analyzing and interpreting ConvNets in the broader Deep Learning community.">

We introduce a network that incorporates a difference approximation for the second order derivative in terms of residual connections between convolutional blocks, whose shared weights represent the coefficients of a second order ordinary differential equation. We further combine this solver-like architecture with a convolutional network, capable of learning the relation between trajectories of coupled oscillators and therefore allows us to make a stable forecast even if the system is only partially observed. We optimize this map together with the solver network, while sharing their weights, to form a powerful framework capable of learning the complex physical properties of a dissipative dynamical system.">

They are powerful tools for modeling continuous-time dynamical systems, enabling the analysis and prediction of complex temporal behaviors. However, how to improve the model's stability and physical interpretability remains a challenge. This paper introduces new conservation relations in Neural ODEs using Lie symmetries in both the hidden state dynamics and the back propagation dynamics. These conservation laws are then incorporated into the loss function as additional regularization terms, potentially enhancing the physical interpretability and generalizability of the model. To illustrate this method, the paper derives Lie symmetries and conservation laws in a simple Neural ODE designed to monitor charged particles in a sinusoidal electric field. New loss functions are constructed from these conservation relations, demonstrating the applicability symmetry-regularized Neural ODE in typical modeling tasks, such as data-driven discovery of dynamical systems.">
