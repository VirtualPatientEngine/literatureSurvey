        <tr id="Simulating rigid collisions among arbitrary shapes is notoriously difficult due to complex geometry and the strong non-linearity of the interactions. While graph neural network (GNN)-based models are effective at learning to simulate complex physical dynamics, such as fluids, cloth and articulated bodies, they have been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very simple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes are often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far from nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with many particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes. Here we introduce the Face Interaction Graph Network (FIGNet) which extends beyond GNN-based methods, and computes interactions between mesh faces, rather than nodes. Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around 4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more computationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn frictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate than analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data. FIGNet represents a key step forward in one of the few remaining physical domains which have seen little competition from learned simulators, and offers allied fields such as robotics, graphics and mechanical design a new tool for simulation and model-based planning.">

        <tr id=": Recent years have seen a rise in techniques for modeling discontinuous dynamics, such as rigid contact or switching motion modes, using deep learning. A common claim is that deep networks are incapable of accurately modeling rigid-body dynamics without explicit modules for handling contacts, due to the continuous nature of how deep networks are parameterized. Here we investigate this claim with experiments on established real and simulated datasets and show that general-purpose graph network simulators, with no contact-speciﬁc assumptions, can learn and predict contact discontinuities. Furthermore, contact dynamics learned by graph network simulators capture real-world cube tossing trajectories more accurately than highly engineered robotics simulators, even when provided with only 8 – 16 trajectories. Overall, this suggests that rigid-body dynamics do not pose a fundamental challenge for deep networks with the appropriate general architecture and parameterization. Instead, our work opens new directions for considering when deep learning-based models might be preferable to traditional simulation environments for accurately modeling real-world contact dynamics.">

        <tr id="Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.">

        <tr id="Designing physical artifacts that serve a purpose - such as tools and other functional structures - is central to engineering as well as everyday human behavior. Though automating design has tremendous promise, general-purpose methods do not yet exist. Here we explore a simple, fast, and robust approach to inverse design which combines learned forward simulators based on graph neural networks with gradient-based design optimization. Our approach solves high-dimensional problems with complex physical dynamics, including designing surfaces and tools to manipulate fluid flows and optimizing the shape of an airfoil to minimize drag. This framework produces high-quality designs by propagating gradients through trajectories of hundreds of steps, even when using models that were pre-trained for single-step predictions on data substantially different from the design tasks. In our fluid manipulation tasks, the resulting designs outperformed those found by sampling-based optimization techniques. In airfoil design, they matched the quality of those obtained with a specialized solver. Our results suggest that despite some remaining challenges, machine learning-based simulators are maturing to the point where they can support general-purpose design optimization across a variety of domains.">

        <tr id="In the area of physical simulations, nearly all neural-network-based methods directly predict future states from the input states. However, many traditional simulation engines instead model the constraints of the system and select the state which satisfies them. Here we present a framework for constraint-based learned simulation, where a scalar constraint function is implemented as a graph neural network, and future predictions are computed by solving the optimization problem defined by the learned constraint. Our model achieves comparable or better accuracy to top learned simulators on a variety of challenging physical domains, and offers several unique advantages. We can improve the simulation accuracy on a larger system by applying more solver iterations at test time. We also can incorporate novel hand-designed constraints at test time and simulate new dynamics which were not present in the training data. Our constraint-based framework shows how key techniques from traditional simulation and numerical methods can be leveraged as inductive biases in machine learning simulators.">

        <tr id="Realistic simulation is critical for applications ranging from robotics to animation. Traditional analytic simulators sometimes struggle to capture sufficiently realistic simulation which can lead to problems including the well known"sim-to-real"gap in robotics. Learned simulators have emerged as an alternative for better capturing real-world physical dynamics, but require access to privileged ground truth physics information such as precise object geometry or particle tracks. Here we propose a method for learning simulators directly from observations. Visual Particle Dynamics (VPD) jointly learns a latent particle-based representation of 3D scenes, a neural simulator of the latent particle dynamics, and a renderer that can produce images of the scene from arbitrary views. VPD learns end to end from posed RGB-D videos and does not require access to privileged information. Unlike existing 2D video prediction models, we show that VPD's 3D structure enables scene editing and long-term predictions. These results pave the way for downstream applications ranging from video editing to robotic planning.">

Our model takes graphs as input, performs object- and relation-centric reasoning in a way that is analogous to a simulation, and is implemented using deep neural networks. We evaluate its ability to reason about several challenging physical domains: n-body problems, rigid-body collision, and non-rigid dynamics. Our results show it can be trained to accurately simulate the physical trajectories of dozens of objects over thousands of time steps, estimate abstract quantities such as energy, and generalize automatically to systems with different numbers and configurations of objects and relations. Our interaction network implementation is the first general-purpose, learnable physics engine, and a powerful general framework for reasoning about object and relations in a wide variety of complex real-world domains.">

Here we introduce a new class of learnable models--based on graph networks--which implement an inductive bias for object- and relation-centric representations of complex, dynamical systems. Our results show that as a forward model, our approach supports accurate predictions from real and simulated data, and surprisingly strong and efficient generalization, across eight distinct physical systems which we varied parametrically and structurally. We also found that our inference model can perform system identification. Our models are also differentiable, and support online planning via gradient-based trajectory optimization, as well as offline policy optimization. Our framework offers new opportunities for harnessing and exploiting rich knowledge about the world, and takes a key step toward building machines with more human-like representations of the world.">

        <tr id="Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. 
The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.">

Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework advances the state-of-the-art in learned physical simulation, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.">

The technique works as follows: we first encourage sparse latent representations when we train a GNN in a supervised setting, then we apply symbolic regression to components of the learned model to extract explicit physical relations. We find the correct known equations, including force laws and Hamiltonians, can be extracted from the neural network. We then apply our method to a non-trivial cosmology example-a detailed dark matter simulation-and discover a new analytic formula which can predict the concentration of dark matter from the mass distribution of nearby cosmic structures. The symbolic expressions extracted from the GNN using our technique also generalized to out-of-distribution data better than the GNN itself. Our approach offers alternative directions for interpreting neural networks and discovering novel physical principles from the representations they learn.">

We then use symbolic regression to correctly infer an analytical expression for the force law implicitly learned by the neural network, which our results showed is equivalent to Newton’s law of gravitation. The key assumptions our method makes are translational and rotational equivariance, and Newton’s second and third laws of motion. It did not, however, require any assumptions about the masses of planets and moons or physical constants, but nonetheless, they, too, were accurately inferred with our method.

        <tr id="Simulating large scenes with many rigid objects is crucial for a variety of applications, such as robotics, engineering, film and video games. Rigid interactions are notoriously hard to model: small changes to the initial state or the simulation parameters can lead to large changes in the final state. Recently, learned simulators based on graph networks (GNNs) were developed as an alternative to hand-designed simulators like MuJoCo and PyBullet. They are able to accurately capture dynamics of real objects directly from real-world observations. However, current state-of-the-art learned simulators operate on meshes and scale poorly to scenes with many objects or detailed shapes. Here we present SDF-Sim, the first learned rigid-body simulator designed for scale. We use learned signed-distance functions (SDFs) to represent the object shapes and to speed up distance computation. We design the simulator to leverage SDFs and avoid the fundamental bottleneck of the previous simulators associated with collision detection. For the first time in literature, we demonstrate that we can scale the GNN-based simulators to scenes with hundreds of objects and up to 1.1 million nodes, where mesh-based approaches run out of memory. Finally, we show that SDF-Sim can be applied to real world scenes by extracting SDFs from multi-view images.">

The technical core of \moniker{} is a novel intersection contour loss that penalizes interpenetrations and encourages rapid resolution thereof. We integrate our intersection loss with a collision-avoiding repulsion objective into a neural cloth simulation method based on graph neural networks (GNNs).

The ability to accurately predict these topological changes that a specific action might incur is critical for planning interactions with elastoplastic objects. We present DoughNet, a Transformer-based architecture for handling these challenges, consisting of two components. First, a denoising autoencoder represents deformable objects of varying topology as sets of latent codes. Second, a visual predictive model performs autoregressive set prediction to determine long-horizon geometrical deformation and topological changes purely in latent space. Given a partial initial state and desired manipulation trajectories, it infers all resulting object geometries and topologies at each step. DoughNet thereby allows to plan robotic manipulation; selecting a suited tool, its pose and opening width to recreate robot- or human-made goals. Our experiments in simulated and real environments show that DoughNet is able to significantly outperform related approaches that consider deformation only as geometrical change.">

Inspired by the empirical success of causal language modelling and next-token prediction in language modelling, we explore the extent to which next-frame prediction serves as a strong foundational learning strategy (analogous to language modelling) for inducing an understanding of the visual world. In order to quantify the specific visual understanding induced by next-frame prediction, we introduce six diagnostic simulation video datasets derived from fundamental physical laws created by varying physical constants such as gravity and mass. We demonstrate that our models trained only on next-frame prediction are capable of predicting the value of these physical constants (e.g. gravity) without having been trained directly to learn these constants via a regression task. We find that the generative training phase alone induces a model state that can predict physical constants significantly better than that of a random model, improving the loss by a factor of between 1.28 to 6.24. We conclude that next-frame prediction shows great promise as a general learning strategy to induce understanding of the many `laws' that govern the visual domain without the need for explicit labelling.">

        <tr id="Deformable object manipulation is a long-standing challenge in robotics. While existing approaches often focus narrowly on a specific type of object, we seek a general-purpose algorithm, capable of manipulating many different types of objects: beans, rope, cloth, liquid, . . . . One key difficulty is a suitable representation, rich enough to capture object shape, dynamics for manipulation and yet simple enough to be acquired effectively from sensor data. Specifically, we propose Differentiable Particles (DiPac), a new algorithm for deformable object manipulation. DiPac represents a deformable object as a set of particles and uses a differentiable particle dynamics simulator to reason about robot manipulation. To find the best manipulation action, DiPac combines learning, planning, and trajectory optimization through differentiable trajectory tree optimization. Differentiable dynamics provides significant benefits and enable DiPac to (i) estimate the dynamics parameters efficiently, thereby narrowing the sim-to-real gap, and (ii) choose the best action by backpropagating the gradient along sampled trajectories. Both simulation and real-robot experiments show promising results. DiPac handles a variety of object types. By combining planning and learning, DiPac outperforms both pure model-based planning methods and pure data-driven learning methods. In addition, DiPac is robust and adapts to changes in dynamics, thereby enabling the transfer of an expert policy from one object to another with different physical properties, e.g., from a rigid rod to a deformable rope.">

        <tr id="Constructing simulation scenes that are both visually and physically realistic is a problem of practical interest in domains ranging from robotics to computer vision. This problem has become even more relevant as researchers wielding large data-hungry learning methods seek new sources of training data for physical decision-making systems. However, building simulation models is often still done by hand. A graphic designer and a simulation engineer work with predefined assets to construct rich scenes with realistic dynamic and kinematic properties. While this may scale to small numbers of scenes, to achieve the generalization properties that are required for data-driven robotic control, we require a pipeline that is able to synthesize large numbers of realistic scenes, complete with 'natural' kinematic and dynamic structures. To attack this problem, we develop models for inferring structure and generating simulation scenes from natural images, allowing for scalable scene generation from web-scale datasets. To train these image-to-simulation models, we show how controllable text-to-image generative models can be used in generating paired training data that allows for modeling of the inverse problem, mapping from realistic images back to complete scene models. We show how this paradigm allows us to build large datasets of scenes in simulation with semantic and physical realism. We present an integrated end-to-end pipeline that generates simulation scenes complete with articulated kinematic and dynamic structures from real-world images and use these for training robotic control policies. We then robustly deploy in the real world for tasks like articulated object manipulation. In doing so, our work provides both a pipeline for large-scale generation of simulation environments and an integrated system for training robust robotic control policies in the resulting environments.">

        <tr id="Thermodynamics-informed neural networks employ inductive biases for the enforcement of the first and second principles of thermodynamics. To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.">

        <tr id="Since loose-fitting clothing contains dynamic modes that have proven to be difficult to predict via neural networks, we first illustrate how to coarsely approximate these modes with a real-time numerical algorithm specifically designed to mimic the most important ballistic features of a classical numerical simulation. Although there is some flexibility in the choice of the numerical algorithm used as a proxy for full simulation, it is essential that the stability and accuracy be independent from any time step restriction or similar requirements in order to facilitate real-time performance. In order to reduce the number of degrees of freedom that require approximations to their dynamics, we simulate rigid frames and use skinning to reconstruct a rough approximation to a desirable mesh; as one might expect, neural-network-based skinning seems to perform better than linear blend skinning in this scenario. Improved high frequency deformations are subsequently added to the skinned mesh via a quasistatic neural network (QNN). In contrast to recurrent neural networks that require a plethora of training data in order to adequately generalize to new examples, QNNs perform well with significantly less training data.">

        <tr id="Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment. This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains. Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems. To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation. We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training. Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision. Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs. We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/">

        <tr id="Spatial understanding from vision is crucial for robots operating in unstructured environments. In the real world, spatial understanding is often an ill-posed problem. There are a number of powerful classical methods that accurately regress relative pose, however, these approaches often lack the ability to leverage data-derived priors to resolve ambiguities. In multi-robot systems, these challenges are exacerbated by the need for accurate and frequent position estimates of cooperating agents. To this end, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot, visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data. Unlike prior work evaluated primarily on offline datasets, we design our model specifically for online evaluation and real-world deployment on cooperative robots. Our model is completely decentralized, platform agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing network infrastructure. In this work, we focus on relative pose estimation and local Bird's Eye View (BEV) prediction tasks. Unlike classical approaches, we show that our model can accurately predict relative poses without requiring camera overlap, and predict BEVs of regions not visible to the ego-agent. We demonstrate our model on a multi-robot formation control task outside the confines of the laboratory.">

        <tr id="Many robot manipulation tasks can be framed as geometric reasoning tasks, where an agent must be able to precisely manipulate an object into a position that satisfies the task from a set of initial conditions. Often, task success is defined based on the relationship between two objects - for instance, hanging a mug on a rack. In such cases, the solution should be equivariant to the initial position of the objects as well as the agent, and invariant to the pose of the camera. This poses a challenge for learning systems which attempt to solve this task by learning directly from high-dimensional demonstrations: the agent must learn to be both equivariant as well as precise, which can be challenging without any inductive biases about the problem. In this work, we propose a method for precise relative pose prediction which is provably SE(3)-equivariant, can be learned from only a few demonstrations, and can generalize across variations in a class of objects. We accomplish this by factoring the problem into learning an SE(3) invariant task-specific representation of the scene and then interpreting this representation with novel geometric reasoning layers which are provably SE(3) equivariant. We demonstrate that our method can yield substantially more precise placement predictions in simulated placement tasks than previous methods trained with the same amount of data, and can accurately represent relative placement relationships data collected from real-world demonstrations.

Importantly, our approach requires only the observation of the manipulated object's state, paving the way for the development of physical systems that enable contactless manipulation of objects using air streams.">

        <tr id="Utilizing machine learning to address partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges due to the diversity of spatial domains and their corresponding state configurations, which complicates the task of encompassing all potential scenarios through data-driven methodologies alone. Moreover, there are legitimate concerns regarding the generalization and reliability of such approaches, as they often overlook inherent physical constraints. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel machine-learning architecture that is highly generalizable and adheres to conservation laws and physical symmetries, thereby ensuring greater reliability. The foundation of this architecture is graph neural networks (GNNs), which are adept at accommodating a variety of shapes and forms. Additionally, we explore the parallels between GNNs and traditional numerical solvers, facilitating a seamless integration of conservative principles and symmetries into machine learning models. Our findings from experiments demonstrate that the model's inclusion of physical laws significantly enhances its generalizability, i.e., no significant accuracy degradation for unseen spatial domains while other models degrade.

        <tr id="For partial differential equations on domains of arbitrary shapes, existing works of neural operators attempt to learn a mapping from geometries to solutions. It often requires a large dataset of geometry-solution pairs in order to obtain a sufficiently accurate neural operator. However, for many industrial applications, e.g., engineering design optimization, it can be prohibitive to satisfy the requirement since even a single simulation may take hours or days of computation. To address this issue, we propose reference neural operators (RNO), a novel way of implementing neural operators, i.e., to learn the smooth dependence of solutions on geometric deformations. Specifically, given a reference solution, RNO can predict solutions corresponding to arbitrary deformations of the referred geometry. This approach turns out to be much more data efficient. Through extensive experiments, we show that RNO can learn the dependence across various types and different numbers of geometry objects with relatively small datasets. RNO outperforms baseline models in accuracy by a large lead and achieves up to 80% error reduction.">

In this paper, we propose SAM-E, a novel architecture for robot manipulation by leveraging a vision-foundation model for generalizable scene understanding and sequence imitation for long-term action reasoning. Specifically, we adopt Segment Anything (SAM) pre-trained on a huge number of images and promptable masks as the foundation model for extracting task-relevant features, and employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on robot data for a better understanding of embodied scenarios. To address long-horizon reasoning, we develop a novel multi-channel heatmap that enables the prediction of the action sequence in a single pass, notably enhancing execution efficiency. Experimental results from various instruction-following tasks demonstrate that SAM-E achieves superior performance with higher execution efficiency compared to the baselines, and also significantly improves generalization in few-shot adaptation to new tasks.">

We present an exhaustive survey of existing classical methods for doing correspondence via feature-matching, including SIFT, SURF, and ORB, and two recently published learning-based methods including TimeCycle and Dense Object Nets. We make three main contributions: (1) a framework for simulating and rendering synthetic images of deformable objects, with qualitative results demonstrating transfer between our simulated and real domains (2) a new learning-based correspondence method extending Dense Object Nets, and (3) a standardized comparison across state-of-the-art correspondence methods. Our proposed method provides a flexible, general formulation for learning temporally and spatially continuous correspondences for nonrigid (and rigid) objects. We report root mean squared error statistics for all methods and find that Dense Object Nets outperforms baseline classical methods for correspondence, and our proposed extension of Dense Object Nets performs similarly.">

We introduce parameterized quasi-physical simulators and a physics curriculum to overcome these limitations. The key ideas are 1) balancing between fidelity and optimizability of the simulation via a curriculum of parameterized simulators, and 2) solving the problem in each of the simulators from the curriculum, with properties ranging from high task optimizability to high fidelity. We successfully enable a dexterous hand to track complex and diverse manipulations in high-fidelity simulated environments, boosting the success rate by 11\%+ from the best-performed baseline.

        <tr id="Of all the vector fields surrounding the minima of recurrent learning setups, the gradient field with its exploding and vanishing updates appears a poor choice for optimization, offering little beyond efficient computability. We seek to improve this suboptimal practice in the context of physics simulations, where backpropagating feedback through many unrolled time steps is considered crucial to acquiring temporally coherent behavior. The alternative vector field we propose follows from two principles: physics simulators, unlike neural networks, have a balanced gradient flow, and certain modifications to the backpropagation pass leave the positions of the original minima unchanged. As any modification of backpropagation decouples forward and backward pass, the rotation-free character of the gradient field is lost. Therefore, we discuss the negative implications of using such a rotational vector field for optimization and how to counteract them. Our final procedure is easily implementable via a sequence of gradient stopping and component-wise comparison operations, which do not negatively affect scalability. Our experiments on three control problems show that especially as we increase the complexity of each task, the unbalanced updates from the gradient can no longer provide the precise control signals necessary while our method still solves the tasks.

        <tr id="In autonomous driving, accurately interpreting the movements of other road users and leveraging this knowledge to forecast future trajectories is crucial. This is typically achieved through the integration of map data and tracked trajectories of various agents. Numerous methodologies combine this information into a singular embedding for each agent, which is then utilized to predict future behavior. However, these approaches have a notable drawback in that they may lose exact location information during the encoding process. The encoding still includes general map information. However, the generation of valid and consistent trajectories is not guaranteed. This can cause the predicted trajectories to stray from the actual lanes. This paper introduces a new refinement module designed to project the predicted trajectories back onto the actual map, rectifying these discrepancies and leading towards more consistent predictions. This versatile module can be readily incorporated into a wide range of architectures. Additionally, we propose a novel scene encoder that handles all relations between agents and their environment in a single unified heterogeneous graph attention network. By analyzing the attention values on the different edges in this graph, we can gain unique insights into the neural network's inner workings leading towards a more explainable prediction.">

Using this joint observation-action representation it computes low-level robot actions using a learnt diffusion process that iteratively updates the virtual renders of the robot. This space unification simplifies the learning problem and introduces inductive biases that are crucial for sample efficiency and spatial generalisation.

In this work, we introduce discrete abstract representations for transformer-based learning (DART), a sample-efficient method utilizing discrete representations for modeling both the world and learning behavior.

We then employ these approaches to create SIMPLER, a collection of simulated environments for manipulation policy evaluation on common real robot setups. Through paired sim-and-real evaluations of manipulation policies, we demonstrate strong correlation between policy performance in SIMPLER environments and in the real world. Additionally, we find that SIMPLER evaluations accurately reflect real-world policy behavior modes such as sensitivity to various distribution shifts.

        <tr id="Given the task of positioning a ball-like object to a goal region beyond direct reach, humans can often throw, slide, or rebound objects against the wall to attain the goal. However, enabling robots to reason similarly is non-trivial. Existing methods for physical reasoning are data-hungry and struggle with complexity and uncertainty inherent in the real world. This paper presents PhyPlan, a novel physics-informed planning framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable embodied agents to perform dynamic physical tasks. PhyPlan leverages PINNs to simulate and predict outcomes of actions in a fast and accurate manner and uses MCTS for planning. It dynamically determines whether to consult a PINN-based simulator (coarse but fast) or engage directly with the actual environment (fine but slow) to determine optimal policy. Given an unseen task, PhyPlan can infer the sequence of actions and learn the latent parameters, resulting in a generalizable approach that can rapidly learn to perform novel physical tasks. Evaluation with robots in simulated 3D environments demonstrates the ability of our approach to solve 3D-physical reasoning tasks involving the composition of dynamic skills. Quantitatively, PhyPlan excels in several aspects: (i) it achieves lower regret when learning novel tasks compared to the state-of-the-art, (ii) it expedites skill learning and enhances the speed of physical reasoning, (iii) it demonstrates higher data efficiency compared to a physics un-informed approach.">

Central to our approach is a neuro-symbolic state representation, in the form of dense scene graph, structured based on the objects present within the environment. This enables efficient learning of the transition function and a discriminator that not only identifies failures but also localizes them facilitating fast re-planning via computation of heuristic distance function. We also present an anytime version of our algorithm, where instead of recovering to the last correct state, we search for a sub-goal in the original plan minimizing the total distance to the goal given a re-planning budget. Experiments on a physics simulator with a variety of simulated failures show the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing baselines, both in terms of efficiency as well as accuracy of our recovery mechanism.">

Existing leading simulators primarily use an encoder-decoder structure to encode the historical trajectories for future simulation. However, such a paradigm complicates the model architecture, and the manual separation of history and future trajectories leads to low data utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Behavior Generative Pre-trained Transformers (BehaviorGPT), a decoder-only, autoregressive architecture designed to simulate the sequential motion of multiple agents. Crucially, our approach discards the traditional separation between"history"and"future,"treating each time step as the"current"one, resulting in a simpler, more parameter- and data-efficient design that scales seamlessly with data and computation. Additionally, we introduce the Next-Patch Prediction Paradigm (NP3), which enables models to reason at the patch level of trajectories and capture long-range spatial-temporal interactions. BehaviorGPT ranks first across several metrics on the Waymo Sim Agents Benchmark, demonstrating its exceptional performance in multi-agent and agent-map interactions.

        <tr id="Dynamic 3D interaction has witnessed great interest in recent works, while creating such 4D content remains challenging. One solution is to animate 3D scenes with physics-based simulation, and the other is to learn the deformation of static 3D objects with the distillation of video generative models. The former one requires assigning precise physical properties to the target object, otherwise the simulated results would become unnatural. The latter tends to formulate the video with minor motions and discontinuous frames, due to the absence of physical constraints in deformation learning. We think that video generative models are trained with real-world captured data, capable of judging physical phenomenon in simulation environments. To this end, we propose DreamPhysics in this work, which estimates physical properties of 3D Gaussian Splatting with video diffusion priors. DreamPhysics supports both image- and text-conditioned guidance, optimizing physical parameters via score distillation sampling with frame interpolation and log gradient. Based on a material point method simulator with proper physical parameters, our method can generate 4D content with realistic motions. Experimental results demonstrate that, by distilling the prior knowledge of video diffusion models, inaccurate physical properties can be gradually refined for high-quality simulation.

        <tr id="Generating diverse and realistic human motion that can physically interact with an environment remains a challenging research area in character animation. Meanwhile, diffusion-based methods, as proposed by the robotics community, have demonstrated the ability to capture highly diverse and multi-modal skills. However, naively training a diffusion policy often results in unstable motions for high-frequency, under-actuated control tasks like bipedal locomotion due to rapidly accumulating compounding errors, pushing the agent away from optimal training trajectories. The key idea lies in using RL policies not just for providing optimal trajectories but for providing corrective actions in sub-optimal states, giving the policy a chance to correct for errors caused by environmental stimulus, model errors, or numerical errors in simulation. Our method, Physics-Based Character Animation via Diffusion Policy (PDP), combines reinforcement learning (RL) and behavior cloning (BC) to create a robust diffusion policy for physics-based character animation. We demonstrate PDP on perturbation recovery, universal motion tracking, and physics-based text-to-motion synthesis.">

Binding site identification methods can now profit from the availability of large amounts of 3D structures in protein structure databases or from AlphaFold predictions. Current binding site identification methods heavily rely on graph neural networks (GNNs), usually designed to output E(3)-equivariant predictions. Such methods turned out to be very beneficial for physics-related tasks like binding energy or motion trajectory prediction. However, the performance of GNNs at binding site identification is still limited potentially due to the lack of dedicated nodes that model hidden geometric entities, such as binding pockets. In this work, we extend E(n)-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) by adding virtual nodes and applying an extended message passing scheme. The virtual nodes in these graphs are dedicated quantities to learn representations of binding sites, which leads to improved predictive performance. In our experiments, we show that our proposed method VN-EGNN sets a new state-of-the-art at locating binding site centers on COACH420, HOLO4K and PDBbind2020.">

        <tr id="Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.">

This approach constructs relevant features via projection onto learnable grids and interpolating adjacent vertices. However, it has limitations in capturing low-frequency details and tends to overuse parameters for low-frequency features due to its bias toward fine details, despite its multi-resolution concept. This phenomenon leads to instability and inefficiency when training poses are sparse. In this work, we propose a method that synergistically integrates multi-plane representation with a coordinate-based MLP network known for strong bias toward low-frequency signals. The coordinate-based network is responsible for capturing low-frequency details, while the multi-plane representation focuses on capturing fine-grained details. We demonstrate that using residual connections between them seamlessly preserves their own inherent properties. Additionally, the proposed progressive training scheme accelerates the disentanglement of these two features. We demonstrate empirically that our proposed method not only outperforms baseline models for both static and dynamic NeRFs with sparse inputs, but also achieves comparable results with fewer parameters.">

To this end, neural operators, which learn mappings from parameters to solutions, have been successfully used. However, the training of neural operators typically demands large training datasets, the acquisition of which can be prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, physics-informed training can offer a cost-effective strategy. However, current physics-informed neural operators face limitations, either in handling irregular domain shapes or in generalization to various discretizations of PDE parameters with variable mesh sizes. In this research, we introduce a novel physics-informed model architecture which can generalize to parameter discretizations of variable size and irregular domain shapes. Particularly, inspired by deep operator neural networks, our model involves a discretization-independent learning of parameter embedding repeatedly, and this parameter embedding is integrated with the response embeddings through multiple compositional layers, for more expressivity. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.">

Prior works studied this problem in high-dimensional Markovian environments, when the current observation may be a complex object but is sufficient to decode the informative state. In this work, we consider the problem of discovering the agent-centric state in the more challenging high-dimensional non-Markovian setting, when the state can be decoded from a sequence of past observations. We establish that generalized inverse models can be adapted for learning agent-centric state representation for this task. Our results include asymptotic theory in the deterministic dynamics setting as well as counter-examples for alternative intuitive algorithms. We complement these findings with a thorough empirical study on the agent-centric state discovery abilities of the different alternatives we put forward. Particularly notable is our analysis of past actions, where we show that these can be a double-edged sword: making the algorithms more successful when used correctly and causing dramatic failure when used incorrectly.">

        <tr id="A good initialization of deep learning models is essential since it can help them converge better and faster. However, pretraining large models is unaffordable for many researchers, which makes a desired prediction for initial parameters more necessary nowadays. Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), one approach to predicting model parameters, have recently shown strong performance in initializing large vision models. Unfortunately, predicting parameters of very wide networks relies on copying small chunks of parameters multiple times and requires an extremely large number of parameters to support full prediction, which greatly hinders its adoption in practice. To address this limitation, we propose LoGAH (Low-rank GrAph Hypernetworks), a GHN with a low-rank parameter decoder that expands to significantly wider networks without requiring as excessive increase of parameters as in previous attempts. LoGAH allows us to predict the parameters of 774-million large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner. We show that vision and language models (i.e., ViT and GPT-2) initialized with LoGAH achieve better performance than those initialized randomly or using existing hypernetworks. Furthermore, we show promising transfer learning results w.r.t. training LoGAH on small datasets and using the predicted parameters to initialize for larger tasks.

While this is appealing due to the lack of modeling requirements, such methods can be sample inefficient, making them impractical in many real-world domains. On the other hand, model-based control techniques leveraging accurate simulators can circumvent these challenges and use a large amount of cheap simulation data to learn controllers that can effectively transfer to the real world. The challenge with such model-based techniques is the requirement for an extremely accurate simulation, requiring both the specification of appropriate simulation assets and physical parameters. This requires considerable human effort to design for every environment being considered. In this work, we propose a learning system that can leverage a small amount of real-world data to autonomously refine a simulation model and then plan an accurate control strategy that can be deployed in the real world. Our approach critically relies on utilizing an initial (possibly inaccurate) simulator to design effective exploration policies that, when deployed in the real world, collect high-quality data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this paradigm in identifying articulation, mass, and other physical parameters in several challenging robotic manipulation tasks, and illustrate that only a small amount of real-world data can allow for effective sim-to-real transfer.

However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 highly competitive downstream tasks, outclassing previous large models. This gives rise to MolGPS, a new graph foundation model that allows to navigate the chemical space, outperforming the previous state-of-the-arts on 26 out the 38 downstream tasks.

        <tr id="Generating robot demonstrations through simulation is widely recognized as an effective way to scale up robot data. Previous work often trained reinforcement learning agents to generate expert policies, but this approach lacks sample efficiency. Recently, a line of work has attempted to generate robot demonstrations via differentiable simulation, which is promising but heavily relies on reward design, a labor-intensive process. In this paper, we propose DiffGen, a novel framework that integrates differentiable physics simulation, differentiable rendering, and a vision-language model to enable automatic and efficient generation of robot demonstrations. Given a simulated robot manipulation scenario and a natural language instruction, DiffGen can generate realistic robot demonstrations by minimizing the distance between the embedding of the language instruction and the embedding of the simulated observation after manipulation. The embeddings are obtained from the vision-language model, and the optimization is achieved by calculating and descending gradients through the differentiable simulation, differentiable rendering, and vision-language model components, thereby accomplishing the specified task. Experiments demonstrate that with DiffGen, we could efficiently and effectively generate robot data with minimal human effort or training time.">

        <tr id="Our work explores the task of generating future sensor observations conditioned on the past. We are motivated by `predictive coding' concepts from neuroscience as well as robotic applications such as self-driving vehicles. Predictive video modeling is challenging because the future may be multi-modal and learning at scale remains computationally expensive for video processing. To address both challenges, our key insight is to leverage the large-scale pretraining of image diffusion models which can handle multi-modality. We repurpose image models for video prediction by conditioning on new frame timestamps. Such models can be trained with videos of both static and dynamic scenes. To allow them to be trained with modestly-sized datasets, we introduce invariances by factoring out illumination and texture by forcing the model to predict (pseudo) depth, readily obtained for in-the-wild videos via off-the-shelf monocular depth networks. In fact, we show that simply modifying networks to predict grayscale pixels already improves the accuracy of video prediction. Given the extra controllability with timestamp conditioning, we propose sampling schedules that work better than the traditional autoregressive and hierarchical sampling strategies. Motivated by probabilistic metrics from the object forecasting literature, we create a benchmark for video prediction on a diverse set of videos spanning indoor and outdoor scenes and a large vocabulary of objects. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of learning to condition on timestamps, and show the importance of predicting the future with invariant modalities.">

        <tr id="Visual perception and navigation have emerged as major focus areas in the field of embodied artificial intelligence. We consider the task of image-goal navigation, where an agent is tasked to navigate to a goal specified by an image, relying only on images from an onboard camera. This task is particularly challenging since it demands robust scene understanding, goal-oriented planning and long-horizon navigation. Most existing approaches typically learn navigation policies reliant on recurrent neural networks trained via online reinforcement learning. However, training such policies requires substantial computational resources and time, and performance of these models is not reliable on long-horizon navigation. In this work, we present a generative Transformer based model that jointly models image goals, camera observations and the robot's past actions to predict future actions. We use state-of-the-art perception models and navigation policies to learn robust goal conditioned policies without the need for real-time interaction with the environment. Our model demonstrates capability in capturing and associating visual information across long time horizons, helping in effective navigation.

        <tr id="Human motion synthesis is an important task in computer graphics and computer vision. While focusing on various conditioning signals such as text, action class, or audio to guide the generation process, most existing methods utilize skeleton-based pose representation, requiring additional skinning to produce renderable meshes. Given that human motion is a complex interplay of bones, joints, and muscles, considering solely the skeleton for generation may neglect their inherent interdependency, which can limit the variability and precision of the generated results. To address this issue, we propose a Shape-conditioned Motion Diffusion model (SMD), which enables the generation of motion sequences directly in mesh format, conditioned on a specified target mesh. In SMD, the input meshes are transformed into spectral coefficients using graph Laplacian, to efficiently represent meshes. Subsequently, we propose a Spectral-Temporal Autoencoder (STAE) to leverage cross-temporal dependencies within the spectral domain. Extensive experimental evaluations show that SMD not only produces vivid and realistic motions but also achieves competitive performance in text-to-motion and action-to-motion tasks when compared to state-of-the-art methods.">

This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation.

Combinatorial optimization problems, which arise when considering an objective function related to a process of interest on discrete structures, are often challenging due to the rapid growth of the solution space. The trial-and-error paradigm of Reinforcement Learning has recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional methods, such as exact algorithms and (meta)heuristics, for discovering better decision-making strategies in a variety of disciplines including chemistry, computer science, and statistics. Despite the fact that they arose in markedly different fields, these techniques share significant commonalities. Therefore, we set out to synthesize this work in a unifying perspective that we term Graph Reinforcement Learning, interpreting it as a constructive decision-making method for graph problems. After covering the relevant technical background, we review works along the dividing line of whether the goal is to optimize graph structure given a process of interest, or to optimize the outcome of the process itself under fixed graph structure. Finally, we discuss the common challenges facing the field and open research questions. In contrast with other surveys, the present work focuses on non-canonical graph problems for which performant algorithms are typically not known and Reinforcement Learning is able to provide efficient and effective solutions.">

Background planning with learned models is often worse than model-free alternatives, such as Double DQN, even though the former uses significantly more memory and computation. The fundamental problem is that learned models can be inaccurate and often generate invalid states, especially when iterated many steps. In this paper, we avoid this limitation by constraining background planning to a set of (abstract) subgoals and learning only local, subgoal-conditioned models. This goal-space planning (GSP) approach is more computationally efficient, naturally incorporates temporal abstraction for faster long-horizon planning and avoids learning the transition dynamics entirely. We show that our GSP algorithm can propagate value from an abstract space in a manner that helps a variety of base learners learn significantly faster in different domains.">

Within this realm, coarse-grained (CG) techniques have emerged as invaluable tools to sample large-scale systems and reach extended timescales by simplifying system representation. However, CG approaches come with a trade-off: they sacrifice atomistic details that might hold significant relevance in deciphering the investigated process. Therefore, a recommended approach is to identify key CG conformations and process them using backmapping methods, which retrieve atomistic coordinates. Currently, rule-based methods yield subpar geometries and rely on energy relaxation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. Conversely, machine learning techniques offer higher accuracy but are either limited in transferability between systems or tied to specific CG mappings. In this work, we introduce HEroBM, a dynamic and scalable method that employs deep equivariant graph neural networks and a hierarchical approach to achieve high-resolution backmapping. HEroBM handles any type of CG mapping, offering a versatile and efficient protocol for reconstructing atomistic structures with high accuracy. Focused on local principles, HEroBM spans the entire chemical space and is transferable to systems of varying sizes. We illustrate the versatility of our framework through diverse biological systems, including a complex real-case scenario.

In this paper, we present FeNNol, a new library for building, training and running force-field-enhanced neural network potentials. It provides a flexible and modular system for building hybrid models, allowing to easily combine state-of-the-art embeddings with ML-parameterized physical interaction terms without the need for explicit programming. Furthermore, FeNNol leverages the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation features of the Jax Python library to enable fast evaluation of NNPs, shrinking the performance gap between ML potentials and standard force-fields. This is demonstrated with the popular ANI-2x model reaching simulation speeds nearly on par with the AMOEBA polarizable force-field on commodity GPUs (GPU=Graphics processing unit).

        <tr id="The automatic design of robots has existed for 30 years but has been constricted by serial non-differentiable design evaluations, premature convergence to simple bodies or clumsy behaviors, and a lack of sim2real transfer to physical machines. Thus, here we employ massively-parallel differentiable simulations to rapidly and simultaneously optimize individual neural control of behavior across a large population of candidate body plans and return a fitness score for each design based on the performance of its fully optimized behavior. Non-differentiable changes to the mechanical structure of each robot in the population -- mutations that rearrange, combine, add, or remove body parts -- were applied by a genetic algorithm in an outer loop of search, generating a continuous flow of novel morphologies with highly-coordinated and graceful behaviors honed by gradient descent. This enabled the exploration of several orders-of-magnitude more designs than all previous methods, despite the fact that robots here have the potential to be much more complex, in terms of number of independent motors, than those in prior studies. We found that evolution reliably produces ``increasingly differentiable'' robots: body plans that smooth the loss landscape in which learning operates and thereby provide better training paths toward performant behaviors. Finally, one of the highly differentiable morphologies discovered in simulation was realized as a physical robot and shown to retain its optimized behavior. This provides a cyberphysical platform to investigate the relationship between evolution and learning in biological systems and broadens our understanding of how a robot's physical structure can influence the ability to train policies for it.

To address this challenge, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach together with Graph Neural Network. We thus propose Neural Bond Graph Encoder (NBgE), a model agnostic physical-informed encoder tailored for multi-physics systems. It provides an unified framework for any multi-physics informed AI with a graph encoder readable for any deep learning model. Our experiments on two challenging multi-domain physical systems - a Direct Current Motor and the Respiratory system - demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a multi-variate time series forecasting task.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we introduce a physics and geometry informed neural operator network with application to the forward simulation of acoustic scattering. The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries. These results highlight the unique generalization capability of the proposed operator learning approach.">

Yet, existing methods either oversimplify cost assumptions or scale poorly with the number of observed trajectories. This paper introduces DataSP, a differentiable all-to-all shortest path algorithm to facilitate learning latent costs from trajectories. It allows to learn from a large number of trajectories in each learning step without additional computation. Complex latent cost functions from contextual features can be represented in the algorithm through a neural network approximation. We further propose a method to sample paths from DataSP in order to reconstruct/mimic observed paths' distributions. We prove that the inferred distribution follows the maximum entropy principle.

However, the computational complexity of online optimization can be problematic on embedded devices. Especially, when we need to guarantee fixed control frequencies. Thus, previous work proposed to reduce the computational burden using imitation learning (IL) approximating the MPC policy by a neural network. In this work, we instead learn the whole planned trajectory of the MPC. We introduce a combination of a novel neural network architecture PlanNetX and a simple loss function based on the state trajectory that leverages the parameterized optimal control structure of the MPC. We validate our approach in the context of autonomous driving by learning a longitudinal planner and benchmarking it extensively in the CommonRoad simulator using synthetic scenarios and scenarios derived from real data. Our experimental results show that we can learn the open-loop MPC trajectory with high accuracy while improving the closed-loop performance of the learned control policy over other baselines like behavior cloning.">

These include linear mode connectivity, model merging, Bayesian neural network inference, metanetworks, and several other characteristics of optimization or loss-landscapes. However, theoretical analysis of the relationship between parameter space symmetries and these phenomena is difficult. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of neural parameter symmetries by introducing new neural network architectures that have reduced parameter space symmetries. We develop two methods, with some provable guarantees, of modifying standard neural networks to reduce parameter space symmetries. With these new methods, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study consisting of multiple tasks aimed at assessing the effect of removing parameter symmetries. Our experiments reveal several interesting observations on the empirical impact of parameter symmetries; for instance, we observe linear mode connectivity between our networks without alignment of weight spaces, and we find that our networks allow for faster and more effective Bayesian neural network training.">

Offline learning at scale has led to breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic manipulation domains. However, scaling up learning for legged robot locomotion, especially with multiple skills in a single policy, presents significant challenges for prior online reinforcement learning methods. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, scalable framework that leverages diffusion models to directly learn from offline multimodal datasets with a diverse set of locomotion skills. With design choices tailored for real-time control in dynamical systems, including receding horizon control and delayed inputs, DiffuseLoco is capable of reproducing multimodality in performing various locomotion skills, zero-shot transfer to real quadrupedal robots, and it can be deployed on edge computing devices. Furthermore, DiffuseLoco demonstrates free transitions between skills and robustness against environmental variations. Through extensive benchmarking in real-world experiments, DiffuseLoco exhibits better stability and velocity tracking performance compared to prior reinforcement learning and non-diffusion-based behavior cloning baselines. The design choices are validated via comprehensive ablation studies. This work opens new possibilities for scaling up learning-based legged locomotion controllers through the scaling of large, expressive models and diverse offline datasets.">

        <tr id="Infants learn actively in their environments, shaping their own learning curricula. They learn about their environments' affordances, that is, how local circumstances determine how their behavior can affect the environment. Here we model this type of behavior by means of a deep learning architecture. The architecture mediates between global cognitive map exploration and local affordance learning. Inference processes actively move the simulated agent towards regions where they expect affordance-related knowledge gain. We contrast three measures of uncertainty to guide this exploration: predicted uncertainty of a model, standard deviation between the means of several models (SD), and the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between several models. We show that the first measure gets fooled by aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the environment, while the two other measures focus learning on epistemic uncertainty. JSD exhibits the most balanced exploration strategy. From a computational perspective, our model suggests three key ingredients for coordinating the active generation of learning curricula: (1) Navigation behavior needs to be coordinated with local motor behavior for enabling active affordance learning. (2) Affordances need to be encoded locally for acquiring generalized knowledge. (3) Effective active affordance learning mechanisms should use density comparison techniques for estimating expected knowledge gain. Future work may seek collaborations with developmental psychology to model active play in children in more realistic scenarios.">

The differentiation of this forward kinematic mapping is usually employed to solve the inverse kinematic problem for determining the actuation parameters that can realize a target shape. However, the free-form surfaces obtained from simulators are always different from the physically deformed shapes due to the errors introduced by hardware and the simplification adopted in physical simulation. To fill the gap, we propose a novel deformation function based sim-to-real learning method that can map the geometric shape of a simulated model into its corresponding shape of the physical model. Unlike the existing sim-to-real learning methods that rely on completely acquired dense markers, our method accommodates sparsely distributed markers and can resiliently use all captured frames -- even for those in the presence of missing markers. To demonstrate its effectiveness, our sim-to-real method has been integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline designed to tackle the inverse kinematic problem on a pneumatically actuated deformable mannequin.">

Resorting only to classical methods to reliably model a quadrotor carrying a cable-slung load poses significant challenges. On the other hand, purely data-driven learning methods do not comply by design with the problem's physical constraints, especially in states that are not densely represented in training data. In this work, we explore the use of physics informed neural networks to learn an end-to-end model of the multirotor-slung-load system and, at a given time, estimate a sequence of the future system states. An LSTM encoder decoder with an attention mechanism is used to capture the dynamics of the system. To guarantee the cohesiveness between the multiple predicted states of the system, we propose the use of a physics-based term in the loss function, which includes a discretized physical model derived from first principles together with slack variables that allow for a small mismatch between expected and predicted values. To train the model, a dataset using a real-world quadrotor carrying a slung load was curated and is made available. Prediction results are presented and corroborate the feasibility of the approach. The proposed method outperforms both the first principles physical model and a comparable neural network model trained without the physics regularization proposed.">

        <tr id="Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often suffer from low training efficiency. A strategy to mitigate this issue is to incorporate a model-based planning algorithm, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) or Value Iteration (VI), into the environmental model. The major limitation of VI is the need to iterate over a large tensor. These still lead to intensive computations. We focus on improving the training efficiency of RL algorithms by improving the efficiency of the value learning process. For the deterministic environments with discrete state and action spaces, a non-branching sequence of transitions moves the agent without deviating from intermediate states, which we call a highway. On such non-branching highways, the value-updating process can be merged as a one-step process instead of iterating the value step-by-step. Based on this observation, we propose a novel graph structure, named highway graph, to model the state transition. Our highway graph compresses the transition model into a concise graph, where edges can represent multiple state transitions to support value propagation across multiple time steps in each iteration. We thus can obtain a more efficient value learning approach by facilitating the VI algorithm on highway graphs. By integrating the highway graph into RL (as a model-based off-policy RL method), the RL training can be remarkably accelerated in the early stages (within 1 million frames). Comparison against various baselines on four categories of environments reveals that our method outperforms both representative and novel model-free and model-based RL algorithms, demonstrating 10 to more than 150 times more efficiency while maintaining an equal or superior expected return, as confirmed by carefully conducted analyses. Moreover, a deep neural network-based agent is trained using the highway graph, resulting in better generalization and lower storage costs.">

In this work, we present RUMOR, a novel planner for differential-drive robots that uses deep reinforcement learning to navigate in highly dynamic environments. Unlike other end-to-end DRL planners, it uses a descriptive robocentric velocity space model to extract the dynamic environment information, enhancing training effectiveness and scenario interpretation.

We extensively compare RUMOR with other state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating a better performance, and provide a detailed analysis of the results. Finally, we validate RUMOR's performance in real-world settings by deploying it on a ground robot.

Hence, the capability to automatically detect and self-correct failure action is essential for a practical robotic system. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual instruction following and demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in various tasks. To unleash general MLLMs as an end-to-end robotic agent, we introduce a Self-Corrected (SC)-MLLM, equipping our model not only to predict end-effector poses but also to autonomously recognize and correct failure actions. Specifically, we first conduct parameter-efficient fine-tuning to empower MLLM with pose prediction ability, which is reframed as a language modeling problem. When facing execution failures, our model learns to identify low-level action error causes (i.e., position and rotation errors) and adaptively seeks prompt feedback from experts. Based on the feedback, SC-MLLM rethinks the current failure scene and generates the corrected actions. Furthermore, we design a continuous policy learning method for successfully corrected samples, enhancing the model's adaptability to the current scene configuration and reducing the frequency of expert intervention. To evaluate our SC-MLLM, we conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings. SC-MLLM agent significantly improve manipulation accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art robotic MLLM (ManipLLM), increasing from 57\% to 79\% on seen object categories and from 47\% to 69\% on unseen novel categories.">

Quick adaptability and long-term information retention are essential to operate in dynamic environments typical of humans' everyday lives. A lifelong learning paradigm is thus required, but it is scarcely addressed by current robotics literature. This study empirically investigates the impact of catastrophic forgetting and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer in neural networks trained continuously in an embodied setting. We focus on the task of visual odometry, which holds primary importance for embodied agents in enabling their self-localization. We experiment on the simple continual scenario of discrete transitions between indoor locations, akin to a robot navigating different apartments. In this regime, we observe initial satisfactory performance with high transferability between environments, followed by a specialization phase where the model prioritizes current environment-specific knowledge at the expense of generalization. Conventional regularization strategies and increased model capacity prove ineffective in mitigating this phenomenon. Rehearsal is instead mildly beneficial but with the addition of a substantial memory cost. Incorporating action information, as commonly done in embodied settings, facilitates quicker convergence but exacerbates specialization, making the model overly reliant on its motion expectations and less adept at correctly interpreting visual cues. These findings emphasize the open challenges of balancing adaptation and memory retention in lifelong robotics and contribute valuable insights into the application of a lifelong paradigm on embodied agents.">

Recent diffusion-based methods show impressive performance in 3D robotic manipulation tasks, whereas they suffer from severe runtime inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps, especially with high-dimensional observations. To this end, we propose a real-time robotic manipulation model named ManiCM that imposes the consistency constraint to the diffusion process, so that the model can generate robot actions in only one-step inference. Specifically, we formulate a consistent diffusion process in the robot action space conditioned on the point cloud input, where the original action is required to be directly denoised from any point along the ODE trajectory. To model this process, we design a consistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly instead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast convergence in the low-dimensional action manifold. We evaluate ManiCM on 31 robotic manipulation tasks from Adroit and Metaworld, and the results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the state-of-the-art method by 10 times in average inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rate.">

Finite element (FE) models allow for more efficient behavioral prediction, but often require onerous setup, especially for large systems. We present a physics-informed neural network model formed by combining a low fidelity analytical model and input-convex neural networks to learn an underlying energy potential for the actuator from experimental and finite element simulation data. In doing this, the neural network can provide sufficiently accurate predictions about systems made up of multiple units, essentially scaling the model from a single unit to an assembly of many. To test this concept, we compare predictions of the deformation of a 5-actuator system from an FE model and from the physics-informed neural network. The neural network, which provides a prediction similar in accuracy to the FE equivalent, can more easily be adjusted to execute systems of greater quantities of units without drastic increases in computational consumption. In this way, we can scale our predictive understanding with adequate accuracy without compounding resources.">

Classical force field methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network force field models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface instead of the complex physical potential energy surface. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical force fields, equivariant neural network force fields trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their DFT energies.">

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently shown promising advancements, delivering state-of-the-art performance with rather lightweight architectures. In the context of graph-structured data, leveraging the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix for positional encoding is effective. Yet, the approach does not specify how to handle scenarios where edges in the input graph are missing. To this end, we propose a novel positional encoding technique, PerturbPE, that extracts consistent and regular components from the eigenbasis. Our method involves applying multiple perturbations and taking their average to extract the consistent and regular component from the eigenbasis. PerturbPE leverages the Rayleigh-Schrodinger Perturbation Theorem (RSPT) for calculating the perturbed eigenvectors. Employing this labeling technique enhances the robustness and generalizability of the model. Our results support our theoretical findings, e.g. our experimental analysis observed a performance enhancement of up to $12\%$ on the Human3.6M dataset in instances where occlusion resulted in the absence of one edge. Furthermore, our novel approach significantly enhances performance in scenarios where two edges are missing, setting a new benchmark for state-of-the-art.">

Learned dynamic models are incredibly useful because they do not require derivation of an analytical model, they can represent complex, nonlinear behavior directly from data, and they can be evaluated quickly on graphics-processing units (GPUs). In this paper, we present an open-source Python library to further current research in model-based control of soft robot systems.

The issue gets worse when the changing parameters are unobserved, i.e., their value or influence is not directly measurable when collecting data. We introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a framework that encodes said unobserved parameters in a latent context vector as input to a vector field. NCFs leverage differentiability of the vector field with respect to the parameters, along with first-order Taylor expansion to allow any context vector to influence trajectories from other parameters. We validate our method and compare it to established Multi-Task and Meta-Learning alternatives, showing competitive performance in mean squared error for in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluation on the Lotka-Volterra, Glycolytic Oscillator, and Gray-Scott problems.

While prior methods in scene synthesis have prioritized the naturalness and realism of the generated scenes, the physical plausibility and interactivity of scenes have been largely left unexplored. To address this disparity, we introduce PhyScene, a novel method dedicated to generating interactive 3D scenes characterized by realistic layouts, articulated objects, and rich physical interactivity tailored for embodied agents. Based on a conditional diffusion model for capturing scene layouts, we devise novel physics- and interactivity-based guidance mechanisms that integrate constraints from object collision, room layout, and object reachability. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PhyScene effectively leverages these guidance functions for physically interactable scene synthesis, outperforming existing state-of-the-art scene synthesis methods by a large margin. Our findings suggest that the scenes generated by PhyScene hold considerable potential for facilitating diverse skill acquisition among agents within interactive environments, thereby catalyzing further advancements in embodied AI research.

        <tr id="Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved great success in image generation and other fields. By fine sampling through the trajectory defined by the SDE/ODE solver based on a well-trained score model, DMs can generate remarkable high-quality results. However, this precise sampling often requires multiple steps and is computationally demanding. To address this problem, instance-based distillation methods have been proposed to distill a one-step generator from a DM by having a simpler student model mimic a more complex teacher model. Yet, our research reveals an inherent limitations in these methods: the teacher model, with more steps and more parameters, occupies different local minima compared to the student model, leading to suboptimal performance when the student model attempts to replicate the teacher. To avoid this problem, we introduce a novel distributional distillation method, which uses an exclusive distributional loss. This method exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) results while requiring significantly fewer training images. Additionally, we show that DMs' layers are activated differently at different time steps, leading to an inherent capability to generate images in a single step. Freezing most of the convolutional layers in a DM during distributional distillation leads to further performance improvements. Our method achieves the SOTA results on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.54), AFHQv2 64x64 (FID 1.23), FFHQ 64x64 (FID 0.85) and ImageNet 64x64 (FID 1.16) with great efficiency. Most of those results are obtained with only 5 million training images within 6 hours on 8 A100 GPUs. This breakthrough not only enhances the understanding of efficient image generation models but also offers a scalable framework for advancing the state of the art in various applications.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a novel knowledge-informed graph neural planner (KG-Planner) to address the challenge of efficiently planning collision-free motions for robots in high-dimensional spaces, considering both static and dynamic environments involving humans. Unlike traditional motion planners that struggle with finding a balance between efficiency and optimality, the KG-Planner takes a different approach. Instead of relying solely on a neural network or imitating the motions of an oracle planner, our KG-Planner integrates explicit physical knowledge from the workspace. The integration of knowledge has two key aspects: (1) we present an approach to design a graph that can comprehensively model the workspace's compositional structure. The designed graph explicitly incorporates critical elements such as robot joints, obstacles, and their interconnections. This representation allows us to capture the intricate relationships between these elements. (2) We train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that excels at generating nearly optimal robot motions. In particular, the GNN employs a layer-wise propagation rule to facilitate the exchange and update of information among workspace elements based on their connections. This propagation emphasizes the influence of these elements throughout the planning process. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of our KG-Planner, we conduct extensive experiments in both static and dynamic environments.

        <tr id="In numerous artificial intelligence applications, the collaborative efforts of multiple intelligent agents are imperative for the successful attainment of target objectives. To enhance coordination among these agents, a distributed communication framework is often employed. However, information sharing among all agents proves to be resource-intensive, while the adoption of a manually pre-defined communication architecture imposes limitations on inter-agent communication, thereby constraining the potential for collaborative efforts. In this study, we introduce a novel approach wherein we conceptualize the communication architecture among agents as a learnable graph. We formulate this problem as the task of determining the communication graph while enabling the architecture parameters to update normally, thus necessitating a bi-level optimization process. Utilizing continuous relaxation of the graph representation and incorporating attention units, our proposed approach, CommFormer, efficiently optimizes the communication graph and concurrently refines architectural parameters through gradient descent in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on a variety of cooperative tasks substantiate the robustness of our model across diverse cooperative scenarios, where agents are able to develop more coordinated and sophisticated strategies regardless of changes in the number of agents.">

        <tr id="Autonomous systems often encounter environments and scenarios beyond the scope of their training data, which underscores a critical challenge: the need to generalize and adapt to unseen scenarios in real time. This challenge necessitates new mathematical and algorithmic tools that enable adaptation and zero-shot transfer. To this end, we leverage the theory of function encoders, which enables zero-shot transfer by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical principles of Hilbert spaces. Using this theory, we first present a method for learning a space of dynamics spanned by a set of neural ODE basis functions. After training, the proposed approach can rapidly identify dynamics in the learned space using an efficient inner product calculation. Critically, this calculation requires no gradient calculations or retraining during the online phase. This method enables zero-shot transfer for autonomous systems at runtime and opens the door for a new class of adaptable control algorithms. We demonstrate state-of-the-art system modeling accuracy for two MuJoCo robot environments and show that the learned models can be used for more efficient MPC control of a quadrotor.">

Traditional methods rely on training with large-scale labeled data, but in environments with continuous and high-dimensional state spaces, the data become sparse, leading to weak generalization ability of the trained models when transferred to real-world applications. To address this challenge, we present an innovative maximum entropy Deep Q-Network (ME-DQN), which leverages an attention mechanism. The framework solves complex and sparse reward tasks through probabilistic reasoning while eliminating the trouble of adjusting hyper-parameters. This approach aims to merge the robust feature extraction capabilities of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) with the efficient feature selection of the attention mechanism across diverse task scenarios. By integrating an advantage function with the reasoning and decision-making of deep reinforcement learning, ME-DQN propels the frontier of robotic grasping and expands the boundaries of intelligent perception and grasping decision-making in unstructured environments. Our simulations demonstrate a remarkable grasping success rate of 91.6%, while maintaining excellent generalization performance in the real world.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how several E(n) equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different nature: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The experiment results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, highlighting the benefits of principled geometric inductive bias.">

This work describes a data-driven technique to create high-fidelity low-dimensional models of flexible fiber dynamics using machine learning; the technique is applied to sedimentation in a quiescent, viscous Newtonian fluid, using results from detailed simulations as the data set. The approach combines an autoencoder neural network architecture to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the filament shape, with a neural ODE that learns the evolution of the particle in the latent state. The model was designed to model filaments of varying flexibility, characterized by an elasto-gravitational number $\mathcal{B}$, and was trained on a data set containing the evolution of fibers beginning at set angles of inclination. For the range of $\mathcal{B}$ considered here (100-10000), the filament shape dynamics can be represented with high accuracy with only four degrees of freedom, in contrast to the 93 present in the original bead-spring model used to generate the dynamic trajectories. We predict the evolution of fibers set at arbitrary angles and demonstrate that our data-driven model can accurately forecast the evolution of a fiber at both trained and untrained elasto-gravitational numbers.">

By learning from high-quality data, machine-learned interatomic potentials achieve accuracy on par with ab initio and first-principles methods at a fraction of their computational cost. The success of machine-learned interatomic potentials arises from integrating inductive biases such as equivariance to group actions on an atomic system, e.g., equivariance to rotations and reflections. In particular, the field has notably advanced with the emergence of equivariant message-passing architectures. Most of these models represent an atomic system using spherical tensors, tensor products of which require complicated numerical coefficients and can be computationally demanding. This work introduces higher-rank irreducible Cartesian tensors as an alternative to spherical tensors, addressing the above limitations. We integrate irreducible Cartesian tensor products into message-passing neural networks and prove the equivariance of the resulting layers. Through empirical evaluations on various benchmark data sets, we consistently observe on-par or better performance than that of state-of-the-art spherical models.">

        <tr id="Predicting the future trajectories of dynamic traffic actors is a cornerstone task in autonomous driving. Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.">

Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.">

Another approach is to take advantage of small graph neural networks (GNNs) to construct preconditioners of the predefined sparsity pattern. In our work, we recall well-established preconditioners from linear algebra and use them as a starting point for training the GNN.

        <tr id="Learning-based methods have become increasingly popular for solving vehicle routing problems due to their near-optimal performance and fast inference speed. Among them, the combination of deep reinforcement learning and graph representation allows for the abstraction of node topology structures and features in an encoder-decoder style. Such an approach makes it possible to solve routing problems end-to-end without needing complicated heuristic operators designed by domain experts. Existing research studies have been focusing on novel encoding and decoding structures via various neural network models to enhance the node embedding representation. Despite the sophisticated approaches applied, there is a noticeable lack of consideration for the graph-theoretic properties inherent to routing problems. Moreover, the potential ramifications of inter-nodal interactions on the decision-making efficacy of the models have not been adequately explored. To bridge this gap, we propose an adaptive Graph Attention Sampling with the Edges Fusion framework (GASE),where nodes' embedding is determined through attention calculation from certain highly correlated neighbourhoods and edges, utilizing a filtered adjacency matrix. In detail, the selections of particular neighbours and adjacency edges are led by a multi-head attention mechanism, contributing directly to the message passing and node embedding in graph attention sampling networks. Furthermore, we incorporate an adaptive actor-critic algorithm with policy improvements to expedite the training convergence. We then conduct comprehensive experiments against baseline methods on learning-based VRP tasks from different perspectives. Our proposed model outperforms the existing methods by 2.08\%-6.23\% and shows stronger generalization ability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on randomly generated instances and real-world datasets.">

This advancement not only boosts sampling efficiency but also maintains the fidelity of prediction accuracy. Our method meets the rigorous real-time operational standards essential for autonomous vehicles, enabling prompt trajectory generation that is vital for secure and efficient navigation.

Augmenting MPNNs with a virtual node (VN) removes the locality constraint of the layer aggregation and has been found to improve performance on a range of benchmarks. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the role of VNs and benefits thereof, through the lenses of oversmoothing, oversquashing, and sensitivity analysis. First, in contrast to prior belief, we find that VNs typically avoid replicating anti-smoothing approaches to maintain expressive power. Second, we characterize, precisely, how the improvement afforded by VNs on the mixing abilities of the network and hence in mitigating oversquashing, depends on the underlying topology. Finally, we highlight that, unlike Graph-Transformers (GT), classical instantiations of the VN are often constrained to assign uniform importance to different nodes. Consequently, we propose a variant of VN with the same computational complexity, which can have different sensitivity to nodes based on the graph structure. We show that this is an extremely effective and computationally efficient baseline on graph-level tasks.">

Despite specified models have been proposed for different small- or macro-molecules, few have attempted to unify the learning process, resulting in redundant efforts. Complementary to recent advancements in molecular structure prediction, such as RoseTTAFold All-Atom and AlphaFold3, we propose the unified model UniIF for the inverse folding of all molecules. We do such unification in two levels: 1) Data-Level: We propose a unified block graph data form for all molecules, including the local frame building and geometric feature initialization. 2) Model-Level: We introduce a geometric block attention network, comprising a geometric interaction, interactive attention and virtual long-term dependency modules, to capture the 3D interactions of all molecules. Through comprehensive evaluations across various tasks such as protein design, RNA design, and material design, we demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all tasks. UniIF offers a versatile and effective solution for general molecule inverse folding.">

        <tr id="Task planning is emerging as an important research topic alongside the development of large language models (LLMs). It aims to break down complex user requests into solvable sub-tasks, thereby fulfilling the original requests. In this context, the sub-tasks can be naturally viewed as a graph, where the nodes represent the sub-tasks, and the edges denote the dependencies among them. Consequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves selecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and invoking it. In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task planning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt design. Our interest in graph learning stems from a theoretical discovery: the biases of attention and auto-regressive loss impede LLMs' ability to effectively navigate decision-making on graphs, which is adeptly addressed by graph neural networks (GNNs). This theoretical insight led us to integrate GNNs with LLMs to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNN-based methods surpass existing solutions even without training, and minimal training can further enhance their performance. Additionally, our approach complements prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques, with performance further enhanced by improved prompts or a fine-tuned model.">

Recent advances attempt to incorporate prior physical knowledge into the deep learning framework to estimate the unknown governing partial differential equations (PDEs), which have shown promising results in spatiotemporal prediction tasks. However, previous approaches only restrict neural network architectures or loss functions to acquire physical or PDE features, which decreases the representative capacity of a neural network. Meanwhile, the updating process of the physical state cannot be effectively estimated. To solve the above mentioned problems, this paper proposes a physical-guided neural network, which utilizes the frequency-enhanced Fourier module and moment loss to strengthen the model's ability to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive second-order Runge-Kutta method with physical constraints to model the physical states more precisely. We evaluate our model on both spatiotemporal and video prediction tasks. The experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and performs best in several datasets, with a much smaller parameter count.">

        <tr id="Whether rigid or compliant, contact interactions are inherent to robot motions, enabling them to move or manipulate things. Contact interactions result from complex physical phenomena, that can be mathematically cast as Nonlinear Complementarity Problems (NCPs) in the context of rigid or compliant point contact interactions. Such a class of complementarity problems is, in general, difficult to solve both from an optimization and numerical perspective. Over the past decades, dedicated and specialized contact solvers, implemented in modern robotics simulators (e.g., Bullet, Drake, MuJoCo, DART, Raisim) have emerged. Yet, most of these solvers tend either to solve a relaxed formulation of the original contact problems (at the price of physical inconsistencies) or to scale poorly with the problem dimension or its numerical conditioning (e.g., a robotic hand manipulating a paper sheet). In this paper, we introduce a unified and efficient approach to solving NCPs in the context of contact simulation. It relies on a sound combination of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and proximal algorithms to account for both compliant and rigid contact interfaces in a unified way. To handle ill-conditioned problems and accelerate the convergence rate, we also propose an efficient update strategy to adapt the ADMM hyperparameters automatically. By leveraging proximal methods, we also propose new algorithmic solutions to efficiently evaluate the inverse dynamics involving rigid and compliant contact interactions, extending the approach developed in MuJoCo. We validate the efficiency and robustness of our contact solver against several alternative contact methods of the literature and benchmark them on various robotics and granular mechanics scenarios.

However, existing GFlowNets often suffer from low data efficiency due to the direct parameterization of edge flows or reliance on backward policies that may struggle to scale up to large action spaces. In this paper, we introduce Bifurcated GFlowNets (BN), a novel approach that employs a bifurcated architecture to factorize the flows into separate representations for state flows and edge-based flow allocation. This factorization enables BN to learn more efficiently from data and better handle large-scale problems while maintaining the convergence guarantee. Through extensive experiments on standard evaluation benchmarks, we demonstrate that BN significantly improves learning efficiency and effectiveness compared to strong baselines.">

Complex Network Theory (CNT), merging statistical physics with graph theory, provides a method for interpreting neural networks by analysing their weights and neuron structures. However, classic works adapt CNT metrics that only permit a topological analysis as they do not account for the effect of the input data. In addition, CNT metrics have been applied to a limited range of architectures, mainly including Fully Connected neural networks. In this work, we extend the existing CNT metrics with measures that sample from the DNNs' training distribution, shifting from a purely topological analysis to one that connects with the interpretability of deep learning. For the novel metrics, in addition to the existing ones, we provide a mathematical formalisation for Fully Connected, AutoEncoder, Convolutional and Recurrent neural networks, of which we vary the activation functions and the number of hidden layers. We show that these metrics differentiate DNNs based on the architecture, the number of hidden layers, and the activation function. Our contribution provides a method rooted in physics for interpreting DNNs that offers insights beyond the traditional input-output relationship and the CNT topological analysis.">

Prior work that studied how to predict accurate short-term human trajectories with only unimodal features often failed in long-term prediction. Reinforcement learning provides a good solution for learning human long-term behaviors but can suffer from challenges in data efficiency and optimization. In this work, we propose a long-term human trajectory forecasting framework that leverages a guided diffusion model to generate diverse long-term human behaviors in a high-level latent action space, obtained via a hierarchical action quantization scheme using a VQ-VAE to discretize continuous trajectories and the available context. The latent actions are predicted by our guided diffusion model, which uses physics-inspired guidance at test time to constrain generated multimodal action distributions. Specifically, we use reachability analysis during the reverse denoising process to guide the diffusion steps toward physically feasible latent actions. We evaluate our framework on two publicly available human trajectory forecasting datasets: SFU-Store-Nav and JRDB, and extensive experimental results show that our framework achieves superior performance in long-term human trajectory forecasting.">

We find that, with the right action space, LLMs are capable of successfully generating policies for a variety of contact-rich and high-precision manipulation tasks, even under noisy conditions, such as perceptual errors or grasping inaccuracies. Specifically, we reparameterize the action space to include compliance with constraints on the interaction forces and stiffnesses involved in reaching a target pose. We validate this approach on subtasks derived from the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB) and NIST Task Board Benchmarks.

In this work, we present the first machine learning approach to generate a new class of low-discrepancy point sets named Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) points. Motivated by the geometric nature of generating low-discrepancy point sets, we leverage tools from Geometric Deep Learning and base our model on Graph Neural Networks. We further provide an extension of our framework to higher dimensions, which flexibly allows the generation of custom-made points that emphasize the uniformity in specific dimensions that are primarily important for the particular problem at hand. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance superior to previous methods by a significant margin.

These constraints prevent these systems from leveraging recent developments in visuomotor policy architectures that require high-end GPUs to achieve fast policy inference. In this paper, we propose Consistency Policy, a faster and similarly powerful alternative to Diffusion Policy for learning visuomotor robot control. By virtue of its fast inference speed, Consistency Policy can enable low latency decision making in resource-constrained robotic setups. A Consistency Policy is distilled from a pretrained Diffusion Policy by enforcing self-consistency along the Diffusion Policy's learned trajectories. We compare Consistency Policy with Diffusion Policy and other related speed-up methods across 6 simulation tasks as well as two real-world tasks where we demonstrate inference on a laptop GPU. For all these tasks, Consistency Policy speeds up inference by an order of magnitude compared to the fastest alternative method and maintains competitive success rates. We also show that the Conistency Policy training procedure is robust to the pretrained Diffusion Policy's quality, a useful result that helps practioners avoid extensive testing of the pretrained model. Key design decisions that enabled this performance are the choice of consistency objective, reduced initial sample variance, and the choice of preset chaining steps.

Traditional machine learning frameworks for guided design use a generative model and a surrogate model (discriminator), requiring large datasets. However, real-world scientific applications often have limited data and complex landscapes, making data-hungry models inefficient or impractical. We propose a new framework, PropEn, inspired by ``matching'', which enables implicit guidance without training a discriminator. By matching each sample with a similar one that has a better property value, we create a larger training dataset that inherently indicates the direction of improvement. Matching, combined with an encoder-decoder architecture, forms a domain-agnostic generative framework for property enhancement. We show that training with a matched dataset approximates the gradient of the property of interest while remaining within the data distribution, allowing efficient design optimization. Extensive evaluations in toy problems and scientific applications, such as therapeutic protein design and airfoil optimization, demonstrate PropEn's advantages over common baselines.

        <tr id="Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world.">

Large-scale perception and long-horizon decision-making are the keys to solving this task as the operation scope expands or complexity rises. Existing navigation methods may suffer from degraded performance in complicated environments induced by scalability-limited map representation or greedy decision strategy. We propose the path-extended graph as a compact map representation providing sufficient structural information within a reasonable receptive field and incorporate it into a hierarchical policy for higher efficiency and generalizability. The path-extended graph contains the concise topology of environment structure and frontier layout for large-scale perception, avoiding the impact of redundant information. The hierarchical policy solves long-horizon non-myopic decision-making through a high-level frontier selection policy using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and a low-level motion controller that handles path planning and collision avoidance. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other competitive approaches in avoiding redundant movement and achieves efficient goal-reaching, especially in complex environments.">

        <tr id="In this study, we address the limitations inherent in most existing vehicle trajectory prediction methodologies that indiscriminately incorporate all agents within a predetermined proximity when accounting for inter-agent interactions. These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.">

        <tr id="Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) hold immense potential for computations due to their Turing completeness and sequential processing capabilities, yet existing methods for their training encounter efficiency challenges. Backpropagation through time (BPTT), the prevailing method, extends the backpropagation (BP) algorithm by unrolling the RNN over time. However, this approach suffers from significant drawbacks, including the need to interleave forward and backward phases and store exact gradient information. Furthermore, BPTT has been shown to struggle with propagating gradient information for long sequences, leading to vanishing gradients. An alternative strategy to using gradient-based methods like BPTT involves stochastically approximating gradients through perturbation-based methods. This learning approach is exceptionally simple, necessitating only forward passes in the network and a global reinforcement signal as feedback. Despite its simplicity, the random nature of its updates typically leads to inefficient optimization, limiting its effectiveness in training neural networks. In this study, we present a new approach to perturbation-based learning in RNNs whose performance is competitive with BPTT, while maintaining the inherent advantages over gradient-based learning. To this end, we extend the recently introduced activity-based node perturbation (ANP) method to operate in the time domain, leading to more efficient learning and generalization. Subsequently, we conduct a range of experiments to validate our approach. Our results show similar performance, convergence time and scalability when compared to BPTT, strongly outperforming standard node perturbation and weight perturbation methods. These findings suggest that perturbation-based learning methods offer a versatile alternative to gradient-based methods for training RNNs which can be ideally suited for neuromorphic applications">

While modern DRL approaches achieved remarkable successes in many robotic scenarios (including mobile robotics, surgical assistance, and autonomous driving) unpredictable and non-stationary environments can pose critical challenges to such methods. These features can significantly undermine fundamental requirements for a successful training process, such as the Markovian properties of the transition model. To address this challenge, we propose a new benchmarking environment for aquatic navigation using recent advances in the integration between game engines and DRL. In more detail, we show that our benchmarking environment is problematic even for state-of-the-art DRL approaches that may struggle to generate reliable policies in terms of generalization power and safety. Specifically, we focus on PPO, one of the most widely accepted algorithms, and we propose advanced training techniques (such as curriculum learning and learnable hyperparameters). Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that a well-designed combination of these ingredients can achieve promising results.

Traditional approaches for creating these environments with surgical scene involve a labor-intensive process where designers hand-craft tissues models with textures and geometries for soft body simulations. This manual approach is not only time-consuming but also limited in the scalability and realism. In contrast, data-driven simulation offers a compelling alternative. It has the potential to automatically reconstruct 3D surgical scenes from real-world surgical video data, followed by the application of soft body physics. This area, however, is relatively uncharted. In our research, we introduce 3D Gaussian as a learnable representation for surgical scene, which is learned from stereo endoscopic video. To prevent over-fitting and ensure the geometrical correctness of these scenes, we incorporate depth supervision and anisotropy regularization into the Gaussian learning process. Furthermore, we apply the Material Point Method, which is integrated with physical properties, to the 3D Gaussians to achieve realistic scene deformations. Our method was evaluated on our collected in-house and public surgical videos datasets. Results show that it can reconstruct and simulate surgical scenes from endoscopic videos efficiently-taking only a few minutes to reconstruct the surgical scene-and produce both visually and physically plausible deformations at a speed approaching real-time. The results demonstrate great potential of our proposed method to enhance the efficiency and variety of simulations available for surgical education and robot learning.">

However, innovations in all areas of jet physics are proceeding in parallel.

This is demonstrated by training on a particular multiclass classification task and then using the learned representation for different classification tasks, for datasets with a different (full) detector simulation, for jets from a different collision system ($pp$ versus $ep$), for generative models, for likelihood ratio estimation, and for anomaly detection. Our OmniLearn approach is thus a foundation model and is made publicly available for use in any area where state-of-the-art precision is required for analyses involving jets and their substructure.">

        <tr id="Biological motion perception (BMP) refers to humans' ability to perceive and recognize the actions of living beings solely from their motion patterns, sometimes as minimal as those depicted on point-light displays. While humans excel at these tasks without any prior training, current AI models struggle with poor generalization performance. To close this research gap, we propose the Motion Perceiver (MP). MP solely relies on patch-level optical flows from video clips as inputs. During training, it learns prototypical flow snapshots through a competitive binding mechanism and integrates invariant motion representations to predict action labels for the given video. During inference, we evaluate the generalization ability of all AI models and humans on 62,656 video stimuli spanning 24 BMP conditions using point-light displays in neuroscience. Remarkably, MP outperforms all existing AI models with a maximum improvement of 29% in top-1 action recognition accuracy on these conditions. Moreover, we benchmark all AI models in point-light displays of two standard video datasets in computer vision. MP also demonstrates superior performance in these cases. More interestingly, via psychophysics experiments, we found that MP recognizes biological movements in a way that aligns with human behavioural data. All data and code will be made public.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we develop SE3Set, an SE(3) equivariant hypergraph neural network architecture tailored for advanced molecular representation learning. Hypergraphs are not merely an extension of traditional graphs; they are pivotal for modeling high-order relationships, a capability that conventional equivariant graph-based methods lack due to their inherent limitations in representing intricate many-body interactions. To achieve this, we first construct hypergraphs via proposing a new fragmentation method that considers both chemical and three-dimensional spatial information of molecular system. We then design SE3Set, which incorporates equivariance into the hypergragh neural network. This ensures that the learned molecular representations are invariant to spatial transformations, thereby providing robustness essential for accurate prediction of molecular properties. SE3Set has shown performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for small molecule datasets like QM9 and MD17. It excels on the MD22 dataset, achieving a notable improvement of approximately 20% in accuracy across all molecules, which highlights the prevalence of complex many-body interactions in larger molecules. This exceptional performance of SE3Set across diverse molecular structures underscores its transformative potential in computational chemistry, offering a route to more accurate and physically nuanced modeling.">

More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training.

        <tr id="Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.

        <tr id="Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators in vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in downstream tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper studies amortized sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free learning objective, relative trajectory balance, for training a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning.">

        <tr id="We present a method to integrate real-time out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for neural network trajectory predictors, and to adapt the control strategy of a robot (e.g., a self-driving car or drone) to preserve safety while operating in OOD regimes. Specifically, we use a neural network ensemble to predict the trajectory for a dynamic obstacle (such as a pedestrian), and use the maximum singular value of the empirical covariance among the ensemble as a signal for OOD detection. We calibrate this signal with a small fraction of held-out training data using the methodology of conformal prediction, to derive an OOD detector with probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate of the detector, given a user-specified confidence level. During in-distribution operation, we use an MPC controller to avoid collisions with the obstacle based on the trajectory predicted by the neural network ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, we switch to a reachability-based controller to guarantee safety under the worst-case actions of the obstacle. We verify our method in extensive autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian crossing scenario, showing that our OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted range. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with real pedestrian data. We show improved safety and less conservatism in comparison with two state-of-the-art methods that also use conformal prediction, but without OOD adaptation.">

        <tr id="Reduced order modeling lowers the computational cost of solving PDEs by learning a low-order spatial representation from data and dynamically evolving these representations using manifold projections of the governing equations. While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.">

        <tr id="The well-established modular autonomous driving system is decoupled into different standalone tasks, e.g. perception, prediction and planning, suffering from information loss and error accumulation across modules. In contrast, end-to-end paradigms unify multi-tasks into a fully differentiable framework, allowing for optimization in a planning-oriented spirit. Despite the great potential of end-to-end paradigms, both the performance and efficiency of existing methods are not satisfactory, particularly in terms of planning safety. We attribute this to the computationally expensive BEV (bird's eye view) features and the straightforward design for prediction and planning. To this end, we explore the sparse representation and review the task design for end-to-end autonomous driving, proposing a new paradigm named SparseDrive. Concretely, SparseDrive consists of a symmetric sparse perception module and a parallel motion planner. The sparse perception module unifies detection, tracking and online mapping with a symmetric model architecture, learning a fully sparse representation of the driving scene. For motion prediction and planning, we review the great similarity between these two tasks, leading to a parallel design for motion planner. Based on this parallel design, which models planning as a multi-modal problem, we propose a hierarchical planning selection strategy , which incorporates a collision-aware rescore module, to select a rational and safe trajectory as the final planning output. With such effective designs, SparseDrive surpasses previous state-of-the-arts by a large margin in performance of all tasks, while achieving much higher training and inference efficiency.

Our aim is to leverage bio-inspired methods from computational neuroscience to better understand the neural activity of robust robot locomotion controllers.

We study the biomechanical responses and neural activity within our neural network controller by simultaneously pairing physical disturbances with targeted neural ablations. We identify an agile hip reflex that enables the robot to regain its balance and recover from lateral perturbations. Model gradients are employed to quantify the relative degree that various sensory feedback channels drive this reflexive behavior. We also find recurrent dynamics are implicated in robust behavior, and utilize sampling-based ablation methods to identify these key neurons. Our framework combines model-based and sampling-based methods for drawing causal relationships between neural network activity and robust embodied robot behavior.">

        <tr id="Pose estimation methods and motion capture systems have opened doors to quan- titative measurements of animal kinematics. However, these methods are not perfect and contain missing data. Our method, Deep Imputation for Skeleton data (DISK), leverages deep learning algorithms to learn dependencies between keypoints and their dynamics to impute missing tracking data. We developed an unsupervised training scheme, which does not rely on manual annotations, and tested several neural network architectures for the imputation task. We found that transformer outperforms other architectures including graph con- volutional networks that were developed specifically for skeleton-based action recognition. We demonstrate the usability and performance of our imputation method on seven different animal skeletons including two multi-animal set-ups. With an optional estimated imputation error, DISK enables behavior scien- tists to assess the reliability of the imputed data. The imputed recordings allow to detect more episodes of motion, such as steps, and to obtain more sta- tistically robust results when comparing these episodes between experimental conditions. While animal behavior experiments are expensive and complex, track- ing errors make sometimes large portions of the experimental data unusable. DISK allows for filling in the missing information and for taking full advantage of the rich behavioral data. This stand-alone imputation package, freely available at https://github.com/bozeklab/DISK.git, is applicable to results of any track- ing method (marker-based or markerless) and allows for any type of downstream analysis.">

        <tr id="Deep Ensemble (DE) approach is a straightforward technique used to enhance the performance of deep neural networks by training them from different initial points, converging towards various local optima. However, a limitation of this methodology lies in its high computational overhead for inference, arising from the necessity to store numerous learned parameters and execute individual forward passes for each parameter during the inference stage. We propose a novel approach called Diffusion Bridge Network (DBN) to address this challenge. Based on the theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge, this method directly learns to simulate an Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that connects the output distribution of a single ensemble member to the output distribution of the ensembled model, allowing us to obtain ensemble prediction without having to invoke forward pass through all the ensemble models. By substituting the heavy ensembles with this lightweight neural network constructing DBN, we achieved inference with reduced computational cost while maintaining accuracy and uncertainty scores on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet.

        <tr id="Machine learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool for generating new molecular and material structures. The success of state-of-the-art models stems from their ability to incorporate physical symmetries, such as translation, rotation, and periodicity. Here, we present a novel generative method called Response Matching (RM), which leverages the fact that each stable material or molecule exists at the minimum of its potential energy surface. Consequently, any perturbation induces a response in energy and stress, driving the structure back to equilibrium. Matching to such response is closely related to score matching in diffusion models. By employing the combination of a machine learning interatomic potential and random structure search as the denoising model, RM exploits the locality of atomic interactions, and inherently respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. RM is the first model to handle both molecules and bulk materials under the same framework. We demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of RM across three systems: a small organic molecular dataset, stable crystals from the Materials Project, and one-shot learning on a single diamond configuration.">

Traditional parameterization approaches are designed for high-quality meshes laboriously created by specialized 3D modelers, thus unable to meet the processing demand for the current explosion of ordinary 3D data. Moreover, their working mechanisms are typically restricted to certain simple topologies, thus relying on cumbersome manual efforts (e.g., surface cutting, part segmentation) for pre-processing. In this paper, we introduce the Flatten Anything Model (FAM), an unsupervised neural architecture to achieve global free-boundary surface parameterization via learning point-wise mappings between 3D points on the target geometric surface and adaptively-deformed UV coordinates within the 2D parameter domain. To mimic the actual physical procedures, we ingeniously construct geometrically-interpretable sub-networks with specific functionalities of surface cutting, UV deforming, unwrapping, and wrapping, which are assembled into a bi-directional cycle mapping framework. Compared with previous methods, our FAM directly operates on discrete surface points without utilizing connectivity information, thus significantly reducing the strict requirements for mesh quality and even applicable to unstructured point cloud data. More importantly, our FAM is fully-automated without the need for pre-cutting and can deal with highly-complex topologies, since its learning process adaptively finds reasonable cutting seams and UV boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the universality, superiority, and inspiring potential of our proposed neural surface parameterization paradigm. The code will be publicly available.">

        <tr id="Learning from Interactive Demonstrations has revolutionized the way non-expert humans teach robots. It is enough to kinesthetically move the robot around to teach pick-and-place, dressing, or cleaning policies. However, the main challenge is correctly generalizing to novel situations, e.g., different surfaces to clean or different arm postures to dress. This article proposes a novel task parameterization and generalization to transport the original robot policy, i.e., position, velocity, orientation, and stiffness. Unlike the state of the art, only a set of points are tracked during the demonstration and the execution, e.g., a point cloud of the surface to clean. We then propose to fit a non-linear transformation that would deform the space and then the original policy using the paired source and target point sets. The use of function approximators like Gaussian Processes allows us to generalize, or transport, the policy from every space location while estimating the uncertainty of the resulting policy due to the limited points in the task parameterization point set and the reduced number of demonstrations. We compare the algorithm's performance with state-of-the-art task parameterization alternatives and analyze the effect of different function approximators. We also validated the algorithm on robot manipulation tasks, i.e., different posture arm dressing, different location product reshelving, and different shape surface cleaning.">

In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.">

This is because surgical tasks often involve sequential decision-making processes with complex interactions of physical objects and have low tolerance for mistakes. Prior works assume that all demonstrations are fully observable and optimal, which might not be practical in the real world. This paper introduces a sample-efficient method that learns a robust reward function from a limited amount of ranked suboptimal demonstrations consisting of partial-view point cloud observations. The method then learns a policy by optimizing the learned reward function using reinforcement learning (RL). We show that using a learned reward function to obtain a policy is more robust than pure imitation learning. We apply our approach on a physical surgical electrocautery task and demonstrate that our method can perform well even when the provided demonstrations are suboptimal and the observations are high-dimensional point clouds.

        <tr id="Robotics policies are always subjected to complex, second order dynamics that entangle their actions with resulting states. In reinforcement learning (RL) contexts, policies have the burden of deciphering these complicated interactions over massive amounts of experience and complex reward functions to learn how to accomplish tasks. Moreover, policies typically issue actions directly to controllers like Operational Space Control (OSC) or joint PD control, which induces straightline motion towards these action targets in task or joint space. However, straightline motion in these spaces for the most part do not capture the rich, nonlinear behavior our robots need to exhibit, shifting the burden of discovering these behaviors more completely to the agent. Unlike these simpler controllers, geometric fabrics capture a much richer and desirable set of behaviors via artificial, second order dynamics grounded in nonlinear geometry. These artificial dynamics shift the uncontrolled dynamics of a robot via an appropriate control law to form behavioral dynamics. Behavioral dynamics unlock a new action space and safe, guiding behavior over which RL policies are trained. Behavioral dynamics enable bang-bang-like RL policy actions that are still safe for real robots, simplify reward engineering, and help sequence real-world, high-performance policies. We describe the framework more generally and create a specific instantiation for the problem of dexterous, in-hand reorientation of a cube by a highly actuated robot hand.">

Decades of neurophysiological experiments have shed light on how brain regions [e.g., medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), hippocampus] encode the self’s position and trajectory. However, it has only recently been discovered that MEC and hippocampus are modulated by the positions and trajectories of others. To understand how encoding spatial information of multiple agents shapes neural representations, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that captures properties of MEC to path integrate trajectories of two agents simultaneously navigating the same environment. We find significant differences between these RNNs and those trained to path integrate only a single agent. At the individual unit level, RNNs trained to path integrate more than one agent develop weaker grid responses, stronger border responses, and tuning for the relative position of the two agents. At the population level, they develop more distributed and robust representations, with changes in network dynamics and manifold topology. Our results provide testable predictions and open new directions with which to study the neural computations supporting spatial navigation.">

        <tr id="Value iteration networks (VINs) enable end-to-end learning for planning tasks by employing a differentiable"planning module"that approximates the value iteration algorithm. However, long-term planning remains a challenge because training very deep VINs is difficult. To address this problem, we embed highway value iteration -- a recent algorithm designed to facilitate long-term credit assignment -- into the structure of VINs. This improvement augments the"planning module"of the VIN with three additional components: 1) an"aggregate gate,"which constructs skip connections to improve information flow across many layers; 2) an"exploration module,"crafted to increase the diversity of information and gradient flow in spatial dimensions; 3) a"filter gate"designed to ensure safe exploration. The resulting novel highway VIN can be trained effectively with hundreds of layers using standard backpropagation. In long-term planning tasks requiring hundreds of planning steps, deep highway VINs outperform both traditional VINs and several advanced, very deep NNs.">

        <tr id="Intrinsically disordered proteins have dynamic structures through which they play key biological roles. The elucidation of their conformational ensembles is a challenging problem requiring an integrated use of computational and experimental methods. Molecular simulations are a valuable computational strategy for constructing structural ensembles of disordered proteins but are highly resource-intensive. Recently, machine learning approaches based on deep generative models that learn from simulation data have emerged as an efficient alternative for generating structural ensembles. However, such methods currently suffer from limited transferability when modeling sequences and conformations absent in the training data. Here, we develop a novel generative model that achieves high levels of transferability for intrinsically disordered protein ensembles. The approach, named idpSAM, is a latent diffusion model based on transformer neural networks. It combines an autoencoder to learn a representation of protein geometry and a diffusion model to sample novel conformations in the encoded space. IdpSAM was trained on a large dataset of simulations of disordered protein regions performed with the ABSINTH implicit solvent model. Thanks to the expressiveness of its neural networks and its training stability, idpSAM faithfully captures 3D structural ensembles of test sequences with no similarity in the training set. Our study also demonstrates the potential for generating full conformational ensembles from datasets with limited sampling and underscores the importance of training set size for generalization. We believe that idpSAM represents a significant progress in transferable protein ensemble modeling through machine learning.">

        <tr id="We report on the development of an implementable physics-data hybrid dynamic model for an articulated manipulator to plan and operate in various scenarios. Meanwhile, the physics-based and data-driven dynamic models are studied in this research to select the best model for planning. The physics-based model is constructed using the Lagrangian method, and the loss terms include inertia loss, viscous loss, and friction loss. As for the data-driven model, three methods are explored, including DNN, LSTM, and XGBoost. Our modeling results demonstrate that, after comprehensive hyperparameter optimization, the XGBoost architecture outperforms DNN and LSTM in accurately representing manipulator dynamics. The hybrid model with physics-based and data-driven terms has the best performance among all models based on the RMSE criteria, and it only needs about 24k of training data. In addition, we developed a virtual force sensor of a manipulator using the observed external torque derived from the dynamic model and designed a motion planner through the physics-data hybrid dynamic model. The external torque contributes to forces and torque on the end effector, facilitating interaction with the surroundings, while the internal torque governs manipulator motion dynamics and compensates for internal losses. By estimating external torque via the difference between measured joint torque and internal losses, we implement a sensorless control strategy which is demonstrated through a peg-in-hole task. Lastly, a learning-based motion planner based on the hybrid dynamic model assists in planning time-efficient trajectories for the manipulator. This comprehensive approach underscores the efficacy of integrating physics-based and data-driven models for advanced manipulator control and planning in industrial environments.">

        <tr id="Robot motion planning has made vast advances over the past decades, but the challenge remains: robot mobile manipulators struggle to plan long-range whole-body motion in common household environments in real time, because of high-dimensional robot configuration space and complex environment geometry. To tackle the challenge, this paper proposes Neural Randomized Planner (NRP), which combines a global sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) algorithm and a local neural sampler. Intuitively, NRP uses the search structure inside the global planner to stitch together learned local sampling distributions to form a global sampling distribution adaptively. It benefits from both learning and planning. Locally, it tackles high dimensionality by learning to sample in promising regions from data, with a rich neural network representation. Globally, it composes the local sampling distributions through planning and exploits local geometric similarity to scale up to complex environments. Experiments both in simulation and on a real robot show \NRP yields superior performance compared to some of the best classical and learning-enhanced SBMP algorithms. Further, despite being trained in simulation, NRP demonstrates zero-shot transfer to a real robot operating in novel household environments, without any fine-tuning or manual adaptation.">

        <tr id="Reasoning about large numbers of diverse plans to achieve high speed navigation in cluttered environments remains a challenge for robotic systems even in the case of perfect perceptual information. Often, this is tackled by methods that iteratively optimize around a prior seeded trajectory and consequently restrict to local optima. We present a novel planning method using normalizing flows (NFs) to encode expert-styled motion primitives. We also present an accelerated collision checking framework that enables rejecting samples from the prior distribution before running them through the NF model for rapid sampling of collision-free trajectories. The choice of an NF as the generator permits a flexible way to encode diverse multi-modal behavior distributions while maintaining a smooth relation to the input space which allows approximating collision checks on NF inputs rather than outputs. We show comparable performance to model predictive path integral control in random cluttered environments and improved exit rates in a cul-de-sac environment. We conclude by discussing our plans for future work to improve both safety and performance of our controller.">

The proposed method is demonstrated with two challenging examples -- a double pendulum and a reaction-diffusion system. Results show that our framework is capable of (i) denoising and reconstructing measurements, (ii) learning compact representations of system states, (iii) predicting system evolution in low-dimensional latent spaces, and (iv) quantifying modeling uncertainties.">

        <tr id="There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in robot skill learning have unlocked the potential to construct task-agnostic skill libraries, facilitating the seamless sequencing of multiple simple manipulation primitives (aka. skills) to tackle significantly more complex tasks. Nevertheless, determining the optimal sequence for independently learned skills remains an open problem, particularly when the objective is given solely in terms of the final geometric configuration rather than a symbolic goal. To address this challenge, we propose Logic-Skill Programming (LSP), an optimization-based approach that sequences independently learned skills to solve long-horizon tasks. We formulate a first-order extension of a mathematical program to optimize the overall cumulative reward of all skills within a plan, abstracted by the sum of value functions. To solve such programs, we leverage the use of tensor train factorization to construct the value function space, and rely on alternations between symbolic search and skill value optimization to find the appropriate skill skeleton and optimal subgoal sequence. Experimental results indicate that the obtained value functions provide a superior approximation of cumulative rewards compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods. Furthermore, we validate LSP in three manipulation domains, encompassing both prehensile and non-prehensile primitives. The results demonstrate its capability to identify the optimal solution over the full logic and geometric path. The real-robot experiments showcase the effectiveness of our approach to cope with contact uncertainty and external disturbances in the real world.">

        <tr id="Extrinsic manipulation, the use of environment contacts to achieve manipulation objectives, enables strategies that are otherwise impossible with a parallel jaw gripper. However, orchestrating a long-horizon sequence of contact interactions between the robot, object, and environment is notoriously challenging due to the scene diversity, large action space, and difficult contact dynamics. We observe that most extrinsic manipulation are combinations of short-horizon primitives, each of which depend strongly on initializing from a desirable contact configuration to succeed. Therefore, we propose to generalize one extrinsic manipulation trajectory to diverse objects and environments by retargeting contact requirements. We prepare a single library of robust short-horizon, goal-conditioned primitive policies, and design a framework to compose state constraints stemming from contacts specifications of each primitive. Given a test scene and a single demo prescribing the primitive sequence, our method enforces the state constraints on the test scene and find intermediate goal states using inverse kinematics. The goals are then tracked by the primitive policies. Using a 7+1 DoF robotic arm-gripper system, we achieved an overall success rate of 80.5% on hardware over 4 long-horizon extrinsic manipulation tasks, each with up to 4 primitives. Our experiments cover 10 objects and 6 environment configurations. We further show empirically that our method admits a wide range of demonstrations, and that contact retargeting is indeed the key to successfully combining primitives for long-horizon extrinsic manipulation.

Here, we present a novel deep learning framework to estimate the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the function of two-body interactions, thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.">

        <tr id="We tackle the problem of policy learning from expert demonstrations without a reward function. A central challenge in this space is that these policies fail upon deployment due to issues of distributional shift, environment stochasticity, or compounding errors. Adversarial imitation learning alleviates this issue but requires additional on-policy training samples for stability, which presents a challenge in realistic domains due to inefficient learning and high sample complexity. One approach to this issue is to learn a world model of the environment, and use synthetic data for policy training. While successful in prior works, we argue that this is sub-optimal due to additional distribution shifts between the learned model and the real environment. Instead, we re-frame imitation learning as a fine-tuning problem, rather than a pure reinforcement learning one. Drawing theoretical connections to offline RL and fine-tuning algorithms, we argue that standard online world model algorithms are not well suited to the imitation learning problem. We derive a principled conservative optimization bound and demonstrate empirically that it leads to improved performance on two very challenging manipulation environments from high-dimensional raw pixel observations. We set a new state-of-the-art performance on the Franka Kitchen environment from images, requiring only 10 demos on no reward labels, as well as solving a complex dexterity manipulation task.">

Existing studies primarily focus on uncovering equations that govern nonlinear dynamics based on direct measurement of the system states (e.g., trajectories). Limited efforts have been placed on distilling governing laws of dynamics directly from videos for moving targets in a 3D space. To this end, we propose a vision-based approach to automatically uncover governing equations of nonlinear dynamics for 3D moving targets via raw videos recorded by a set of cameras. The approach is composed of three key blocks: (1) a target tracking module that extracts plane pixel motions of the moving target in each video, (2) a Rodrigues' rotation formula-based coordinate transformation learning module that reconstructs the 3D coordinates with respect to a predefined reference point, and (3) a spline-enhanced library-based sparse regressor that uncovers the underlying governing law of dynamics. This framework is capable of effectively handling the challenges associated with measurement data, e.g., noise in the video, imprecise tracking of the target that causes data missing, etc. The efficacy of our method has been demonstrated through multiple sets of synthetic videos considering different nonlinear dynamics.">

        <tr id="Network control theory (NCT) offers a robust analytical framework for understanding the influence of network topology on dynamic behaviors, enabling researchers to decipher how certain patterns of external control measures can steer system dynamics towards desired states. Distinguished from other structure-function methodologies, NCT's predictive capabilities can be coupled with deploying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have demonstrated exceptional utility in various network-based learning tasks. However, the performance of GNNs heavily relies on the expressiveness of node features, and the lack of node features can greatly degrade their performance. Furthermore, many real-world systems may lack node-level information, posing a challenge for GNNs.To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, NCT-based Enhanced Feature Augmentation (NCT-EFA), that assimilates average controllability, along with other centrality indices, into the feature augmentation pipeline to enhance GNNs performance. Our evaluation of NCT-EFA, on six benchmark GNN models across two experimental setting. solely employing average controllability and in combination with additional centrality metrics. showcases an improved performance reaching as high as 11%. Our results demonstrate that incorporating NCT into feature enrichment can substantively extend the applicability and heighten the performance of GNNs in scenarios where node-level information is unavailable.">

        <tr id="Thanks to the powerful generative capacity of diffusion models, recent years have witnessed rapid progress in human motion generation. Existing diffusion-based methods employ disparate network architectures and training strategies. The effect of the design of each component is still unclear. In addition, the iterative denoising process consumes considerable computational overhead, which is prohibitive for real-time scenarios such as virtual characters and humanoid robots. For this reason, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation into network architectures, training strategies, and inference processs. Based on the profound analysis, we tailor each component for efficient high-quality human motion generation. Despite the promising performance, the tailored model still suffers from foot skating which is an ubiquitous issue in diffusion-based solutions. To eliminate footskate, we identify foot-ground contact and correct foot motions along the denoising process. By organically combining these well-designed components together, we present StableMoFusion, a robust and efficient framework for human motion generation. Extensive experimental results show that our StableMoFusion performs favorably against current state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://h-y1heng.github.io/StableMoFusion-page/">

However, its performance often degrades under vast combinatorial action space, especially where an action is composed of multiple sub-actions. In this work, we propose an action abstraction based on the compositional structure between a state and sub-actions for improving the efficiency of MCTS under a factored action space. Our method learns a latent dynamics model with an auxiliary network that captures sub-actions relevant to the transition on the current state, which we call state-conditioned action abstraction. Notably, it infers such compositional relationships from high-dimensional observations without the known environment model. During the tree traversal, our method constructs the state-conditioned action abstraction for each node on-the-fly, reducing the search space by discarding the exploration of redundant sub-actions. Experimental results demonstrate the superior sample efficiency of our method compared to vanilla MuZero, which suffers from expansive action space.">

        <tr id="Spatiotemporal Traffic Data (STTD) measures the complex dynamical behaviors of the multiscale transportation system. Existing methods aim to reconstruct STTD using low-dimensional models. However, they are limited to data-specific dimensions or source-dependent patterns, restricting them from unifying representations. Here, we present a novel paradigm to address the STTD learning problem by parameterizing STTD as an implicit neural representation. To discern the underlying dynamics in low-dimensional regimes, coordinate-based neural networks that can encode high-frequency structures are employed to directly map coordinates to traffic variables. To unravel the entangled spatial-temporal interactions, the variability is decomposed into separate processes. We further enable modeling in irregular spaces such as sensor graphs using spectral embedding. Through continuous representations, our approach enables the modeling of a variety of STTD with a unified input, thereby serving as a generalized learner of the underlying traffic dynamics. It is also shown that it can learn implicit low-rank priors and smoothness regularization from the data, making it versatile for learning different dominating data patterns. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments in real-world scenarios, showcasing applications from corridor to network scales. Empirical results not only indicate that our model has significant superiority over conventional low-rank models, but also highlight that the versatility of the approach extends to different data domains, output resolutions, and network topologies. Comprehensive model analyses provide further insight into the inductive bias of STTD. We anticipate that this pioneering modeling perspective could lay the foundation for universal representation of STTD in various real-world tasks.">

However, currently available neural network-based modeling approaches fall short when faced with data collected randomly over time and space, as is often the case with sensor networks in real-world applications like crowdsourced earthquake detection or pollution monitoring. In response, we developed a new spatiotemporal method that effectively handles such randomly sampled data. Our model integrates techniques from amortized variational inference, neural differential equations, neural point processes, and implicit neural representations to predict both the dynamics of the system and the probabilistic locations and timings of future observations.

We present Generative Observation Monte Carlo Tree Search (GO-MCTS), which utilizes MCTS on observation sequences generated by a game specific model. This method performs the search within the observation space and advances the search using a model that depends solely on the agent's observations. Additionally, we demonstrate that transformers are well-suited as the generative model in this context, and we demonstrate a process for iteratively training the transformer via population-based self-play.

Numerical results also illustrate the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy, time extrapolability, generalizability and scalability.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

However, this approach can be time-consuming and heavily dependent on prior knowledge and experience. While numerous machine learning models have been developed to streamline this intensive and expert-driven iterative process, these methods typically demand extensive training data and considerable computational resources. Furthermore, methods based on deep learning are usually restricted to the specific domains and tasks for which they were trained, limiting their applicability across different tasks. This creates a trade-off between the efficiency of automation and the demand for resources. In this study, we present a novel approach that integrates pre-trained LLMs with a FEM module. The FEM module evaluates each design and provides essential feedback, guiding the LLMs to continuously learn, plan, generate, and optimize designs without the need for domain-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in managing the iterative optimization of truss structures, showcasing its capability to reason about and refine designs according to structured feedback and criteria. Our results reveal that these LLM-based agents can successfully generate truss designs that comply with natural language specifications with a success rate of up to 90%, which varies according to the applied constraints. By employing prompt-based optimization techniques we show that LLM based agents exhibit optimization behavior when provided with solution-score pairs to iteratively refine designs to meet specifications. This ability of LLM agents to produce viable designs and optimize them based on their inherent reasoning capabilities highlights their potential to develop and implement effective design strategies autonomously.">

The local-dependency of generic transport PDEs implies that it only involves local information to predict the physical properties at a location in the next time step. However, the deep learning architecture will inevitably increase the scope of information to make such predictions as the number of layers increases, which can cause sluggish convergence and compromise generalizability. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a distributed data scoping method with linear time complexity to strictly limit the scope of information to predict the local properties. The numerical experiments over multiple physics show that our data scoping method significantly accelerates training convergence and improves the generalizability of benchmark models on large-scale engineering simulations. Specifically, over the geometries not included in the training data for heat transferring simulation, it can increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 21.7 \% and that of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by 38.5 \% on average.">

        <tr id="With the flourishing development of intelligent warehousing systems, the technology of Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) has experienced rapid growth. Within intelligent warehousing environments, AGV is required to safely and rapidly plan an optimal path in complex and dynamic environments. Most research has studied deep reinforcement learning to address this challenge. However, in the environments with sparse extrinsic rewards, these algorithms often converge slowly, learn inefficiently or fail to reach the target. Random Network Distillation (RND), as an exploration enhancement, can effectively improve the performance of proximal policy optimization, especially enhancing the additional intrinsic rewards of the AGV agent which is in sparse reward environments. Moreover, most of the current research continues to use 2D grid mazes as experimental environments. These environments have insufficient complexity and limited action sets. To solve this limitation, we present simulation environments of AGV path planning with continuous actions and positions for AGVs, so that it can be close to realistic physical scenarios. Based on our experiments and comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, the results demonstrate that our proposed method enables AGV to more rapidly complete path planning tasks with continuous actions in our environments.

        <tr id="Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called"seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.">

Their inherent invariance under symmetries of the input graphs endows them with superior generalization capabilities, compared to their symmetry-oblivious counterparts. However, this comes at the cost of limited expressive power. Particularly, GNNs cannot distinguish between graphs that satisfy identical sentences of C2 logic.

To leverage GNNs for learning policies in PDDL domains, one needs to encode the contextual representation of the planning states as graphs. The expressiveness of this encoding, coupled with a specific GNN architecture, then hinges on the absence of indistinguishable states necessitating distinct actions. This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical and statistical exploration of such situations in PDDL domains across diverse natural encoding schemes and GNN models.">

First, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used to extract geometric features of assembly parts. Then, we combine the extracted features with physical knowledge to derive the parameters of a contact model using our newly proposed neural network structure. The measured force from real experiments is used to supervise the predicted forces, thus avoiding the need for ground truth model parameters. Although trained only on a small set of assembly parts, good contact model estimation for unknown objects were achieved. Our main contribution is the network structure that allows us to estimate contact models of assembly tasks depending on the geometry of the part to be joined. Where current system identification processes have to record new data for a new assembly process, our method only requires the 3D model of the assembly part. We evaluate our method by estimating contact models for robot-guided assembly tasks of pin connectors as well as electronic plugs and compare the results with real experiments.">

Deep learning has emerged as the predominant technique due to its superior modeling capability for trajectory data. However, deep learning‐based models face challenges in effectively utilizing scene information and accurately modeling agent interactions, largely due to the complexity and uncertainty of real‐world scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, this study presents a novel multiagent trajectory prediction model, termed the global‐local scene‐enhanced social interaction graph network (GLSESIGN), which incorporates two pivotal strategies: global‐local scene information utilization and a social adaptive attention graph network. The model hierarchically learns scene information relevant to multiple intelligent agents, thereby enhancing the understanding of complex scenes. Additionally, it adaptively captures social interactions, improving adaptability to diverse interaction patterns through sparse graph structures. This model not only improves the understanding of complex scenes but also accurately predicts future trajectories of multiple intelligent agents by flexibly modeling intricate interactions. Experimental validation on public datasets substantiates the efficacy of the proposed model. This research offers a novel model to address the complexity and uncertainty in multiagent trajectory prediction, providing more accurate predictive support in practical application scenarios.">

        <tr id="We uncover a surprising phenomenon in deep reinforcement learning: training a diverse ensemble of data-sharing agents -- a well-established exploration strategy -- can significantly impair the performance of the individual ensemble members when compared to standard single-agent training. Through careful analysis, we attribute the degradation in performance to the low proportion of self-generated data in the shared training data for each ensemble member, as well as the inefficiency of the individual ensemble members to learn from such highly off-policy data. We thus name this phenomenon the curse of diversity. We find that several intuitive solutions -- such as a larger replay buffer or a smaller ensemble size -- either fail to consistently mitigate the performance loss or undermine the advantages of ensembling. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of representation learning to counteract the curse of diversity with a novel method named Cross-Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) in both discrete and continuous control domains. Our work offers valuable insights into an unexpected pitfall in ensemble-based exploration and raises important caveats for future applications of similar approaches.">

        <tr id="Automatic differentiation is a key feature of present deep learning frameworks. Moreover, they typically provide various ways to specify custom gradients within the computation graph, which is of particular importance for defining surrogate gradients in the realms of non-differentiable operations such as the Heaviside function in spiking neural networks (SNNs). PyTorch, for example, allows the custom specification of the backward pass of an operation by overriding its backward method. Other frameworks provide comparable options. While these methods are common practice and usually work well, they also have several disadvantages such as limited flexibility, additional source code overhead, poor usability, or a potentially strong negative impact on the effectiveness of automatic model optimization procedures. In this paper, an alternative way to formulate surrogate gradients is presented, namely, forward gradient injection (FGI). FGI applies a simple but effective combination of basic standard operations to inject an arbitrary gradient shape into the computational graph directly within the forward pass. It is demonstrated that using FGI is straightforward and convenient. Moreover, it is shown that FGI can significantly increase the model performance in comparison to custom backward methods in SNNs when using TorchScript. These results are complemented with a general performance study on recurrent SNNs with TorchScript and torch.compile, revealing the potential for a training speedup of more than 7x and an inference speedup of more than 16x in comparison with pure PyTorch.">

        <tr id="Autonomous mobile agents often operate in hazardous environments, necessitating an awareness of safety. These agents can have non-linear, stochastic dynamics that must be considered during planning to guarantee bounded risk. Most state of the art methods require closed-form dynamics to verify plan correctness and safety however modern robotic systems often have dynamics that are learned from data. Thus, there is a need to perform efficient trajectory planning with guarantees on risk for agents without known dynamics models. We propose a"generate-and-test"approach to risk-bounded planning in which a planner generates a candidate trajectory using an approximate linear dynamics model and a validator assesses the risk of the trajectory, computing additional safety constraints for the planner if the candidate does not satisfy the desired risk bound. To acquire the approximate model, we use a variational autoencoder to learn a latent linear dynamics model and encode the planning problem into the latent space to generate the candidate trajectory. The VAE also serves to sample trajectories around the candidate to use in the validator. We demonstrate that our algorithm, LaPlaSS, is able to generate trajectory plans with bounded risk for a real-world agent with learned dynamics and is an order of magnitude more efficient than the state of the art.">

        <tr id="Accurately simulating diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents in various scenarios is fundamental to autonomous driving simulation. This task is challenging due to the multi-modality of behavior distribution, the high-dimensionality of driving scenarios, distribution shift, and incomplete information. Our first insight is to leverage state-matching through differentiable simulation to provide meaningful learning signals and achieve efficient credit assignment for the policy. This is demonstrated by revealing the existence of gradient highways and interagent gradient pathways. However, the issues of gradient explosion and weak supervision in low-density regions are discovered. Our second insight is that these issues can be addressed by applying dual policy regularizations to narrow the function space. Further considering diversity, our third insight is that the behaviors of heterogeneous agents in the dataset can be effectively compressed as a series of prototype vectors for retrieval. These lead to our model-based reinforcement-imitation learning framework with temporally abstracted mixture-of-codebooks (MRIC). MRIC introduces the open-loop modelbased imitation learning regularization to stabilize training, and modelbased reinforcement learning (RL) regularization to inject domain knowledge. The RL regularization involves differentiable Minkowskidifference-based collision avoidance and projection-based on-road and traffic rule compliance rewards. A dynamic multiplier mechanism is further proposed to eliminate the interference from the regularizations while ensuring their effectiveness. Experimental results using the largescale Waymo open motion dataset show that MRIC outperforms state-ofthe-art baselines on diversity, behavioral realism, and distributional realism, with large margins on some key metrics (e.g., collision rate, minSADE, and time-to-collision JSD).">

        <tr id="Understanding multi-agent behavior is critical across various fields. The conventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary tasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most existing methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in real-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously. Consequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others, resulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer encoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively scan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within the sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses this unified problem through a versatile generative framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of multi-agent movement.

In this paper, we propose a novel and general Structural Information principles-based framework for effective Decision-Making, namely SIDM, approached from an information-theoretic perspective. This paper presents a specific unsupervised partitioning method that forms vertex communities in the state and action spaces based on their feature similarities. An aggregation function, which utilizes structural entropy as the vertex weight, is devised within each community to obtain its embedding, thereby facilitating hierarchical state and action abstractions. By extracting abstract elements from historical trajectories, a directed, weighted, homogeneous transition graph is constructed. The minimization of this graph's high-dimensional entropy leads to the generation of an optimal encoding tree. An innovative two-layer skill-based learning mechanism is introduced to compute the common path entropy of each state transition as its identified probability, thereby obviating the requirement for expert knowledge. Moreover, SIDM can be flexibly incorporated into various single-agent and multi-agent RL algorithms, enhancing their performance. Finally, extensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that, compared with SOTA baselines, our framework significantly and consistently improves the policy's quality, stability, and efficiency up to 32.70%, 88.26%, and 64.86%, respectively.">

A GNN with shallow layer architectures can only learn short-term relation or localized structure information, limiting its power of learning long-term connection, evidenced by their inferior learning performance on heterophilous graphs. Tackling oversmoothing is crucial to harness deep-layer architectures for GNNs. To date, many methods have been proposed to alleviate oversmoothing. The vast difference behind their design principles, combined with graph complications, make it difficult to understand and even compare their difference in tackling the oversmoothing. In this paper, we propose ATNPA, a unified view with five key steps: Augmentation, Transformation, Normalization, Propagation, and Aggregation, to summarize GNN oversmoothing alleviation approaches. We first outline three themes to tackle oversmoothing, and then separate all methods into six categories, followed by detailed reviews of representative methods, including their relation to the ATNPA, and discussion about their niche, strength, and weakness. The review not only draws in-depth understanding of existing methods in the field, but also shows a clear road map for future study.">

To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness.

Then, a high-level reactive system using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) prevents unsafe execution in the current state of the dynamic environment based on a discrete set of decisions. We first validate our LfD representation in simulation, then experimentally assess the entire framework using a legged mobile manipulator in 36 real-world scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the proposed framework under different dynamic changes in the environment. Our results show that the proposed framework produces robust and stable adaptive behaviors.">

        <tr id="This paper explores the efficacy of diffusion-based generative models as neural operators for partial differential equations (PDEs). Neural operators are neural networks that learn a mapping from the parameter space to the solution space of PDEs from data, and they can also solve the inverse problem of estimating the parameter from the solution. Diffusion models excel in many domains, but their potential as neural operators has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we show that diffusion-based generative models exhibit many properties favourable for neural operators, and they can effectively generate the solution of a PDE conditionally on the parameter or recover the unobserved parts of the system. We propose to train a single model adaptable to multiple tasks, by alternating between the tasks during training. In our experiments with multiple realistic dynamical systems, diffusion models outperform other neural operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the probabilistic diffusion model can elegantly deal with systems which are only partially identifiable, by producing samples corresponding to the different possible solutions.">

        <tr id="While originally developed for continuous control problems, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as the work-horse of a variety of reinforcement learning (RL) applications, including the fine-tuning of generative models. Unfortunately, PPO requires multiple heuristics to enable stable convergence (e.g. value networks, clipping), and is notorious for its sensitivity to the precise implementation of these components. In response, we take a step back and ask what a minimalist RL algorithm for the era of generative models would look like. We propose REBEL, an algorithm that cleanly reduces the problem of policy optimization to regressing the relative reward between two completions to a prompt in terms of the policy, enabling strikingly lightweight implementation. In theory, we prove that fundamental RL algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient can be seen as variants of REBEL, which allows us to match the strongest known theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence and sample complexity in the RL literature. REBEL can also cleanly incorporate offline data and be extended to handle the intransitive preferences we frequently see in practice. Empirically, we find that REBEL provides a unified approach to language modeling and image generation with stronger or similar performance as PPO and DPO, all while being simpler to implement and more computationally efficient than PPO. When fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Instruct, REBEL achieves strong performance in AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and Open LLM Leaderboard.">

        <tr id="The residual loss in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) alters the simple recursive relation of layers in a feed-forward neural network by applying a differential operator, resulting in a loss landscape that is inherently different from those of common supervised problems. Therefore, relying on the existing theory leads to unjustified design choices and suboptimal performance. In this work, we analyze the residual loss by studying its characteristics at critical points to find the conditions that result in effective training of PINNs. Specifically, we first show that under certain conditions, the residual loss of PINNs can be globally minimized by a wide neural network. Furthermore, our analysis also reveals that an activation function with well-behaved high-order derivatives plays a crucial role in minimizing the residual loss. In particular, to solve a $k$-th order PDE, the $k$-th derivative of the activation function should be bijective. The established theory paves the way for designing and choosing effective activation functions for PINNs and explains why periodic activations have shown promising performance in certain cases. Finally, we verify our findings by conducting a set of experiments on several PDEs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nimahsn/pinns_tf2.">

Existing paradigms tackle the issue of learning efficiency over massive datasets from the perspective of self-supervised learning and dataset distillation independently, while neglecting the untapped potential of accelerating representation learning from an intermediate standpoint. In this work, we delve into defining the ideal data properties from both optimization and generalization perspectives. We propose that model-generated representations, despite being trained on diverse tasks and architectures, converge to a shared linear space, facilitating effective linear transport between models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these representations exhibit properties conducive to the formation of ideal data. The theoretical/empirical insights therein inspire us to propose a Representation Learning Accelerator (ReLA), which leverages a task- and architecture-agnostic, yet publicly available, free model to form a dynamic data subset and thus accelerate (self-)supervised learning. For instance, employing a CLIP ViT B/16 as a prior model for dynamic data generation, ReLA-aided BYOL can train a ResNet-50 from scratch with 50% of ImageNet-1K, yielding performance surpassing that of training on the full dataset. Additionally, employing a ResNet-18 pre-trained on CIFAR-10 can enhance ResNet-50 training on 10% of ImageNet-1K, resulting in a 7.7% increase in accuracy.">

        <tr id="AI-driven design problems, such as DNA/protein sequence design, are commonly tackled from two angles: generative modeling, which efficiently captures the feasible design space (e.g., natural images or biological sequences), and model-based optimization, which utilizes reward models for extrapolation. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we adopt a hybrid method that fine-tunes cutting-edge diffusion models by optimizing reward models through RL. Although prior work has explored similar avenues, they primarily focus on scenarios where accurate reward models are accessible. In contrast, we concentrate on an offline setting where a reward model is unknown, and we must learn from static offline datasets, a common scenario in scientific domains. In offline scenarios, existing approaches tend to suffer from overoptimization, as they may be misled by the reward model in out-of-distribution regions. To address this, we introduce a conservative fine-tuning approach, BRAID, by optimizing a conservative reward model, which includes additional penalization outside of offline data distributions. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to outperform the best designs in offline data, leveraging the extrapolation capabilities of reward models while avoiding the generation of invalid designs through pre-trained diffusion models.">

We propose a new method for direct multi-scale topology optimization using neural networks. Our approach focuses on inverse homogenization that seamlessly maintains compatibility across neighboring microstructure cells. Our approach consists of a topology neural network that optimizes the microstructure shape and distribution across the design domain as a continuous field. Each microstructure cell is optimized based on a specified elasticity tensor that also accommodates in-plane rotations. The neural network takes as input the local coordinates within a cell to represent the density distribution within a cell, as well as the global coordinates of each cell to design spatially varying microstructure cells. As such, our approach models an n-dimensional multi-scale optimization problem as a 2n-dimensional inverse homogenization problem using neural networks. During the inverse homogenization of each unit cell, we extend the boundary of each cell by scaling the input coordinates such that the boundaries of neighboring cells are combined. Inverse homogenization on the combined cell improves connectivity. We demonstrate our method through the design and optimization of graded multi-scale structures.">

To overcome this limitation, we propose \textit{Neural Polarization}, a novel method extending equivariant network by embedding each atom as a pair of fixed and moving points.

However, this feedback loop is often slow, including delayed community interactions and the gradual integration of experimental data into theoretical frameworks. This challenge is particularly exacerbated in domains dealing with high-dimensional object spaces, such as molecules and complex microstructures. Hence, the integration of theory within automated and autonomous experimental setups, or theory in the loop automated experiment, is emerging as a crucial objective for accelerating scientific research. The critical aspect is not only to use theory but also on-the-fly theory updates during the experiment. Here, we introduce a method for integrating theory into the loop through Bayesian co-navigation of theoretical model space and experimentation. Our approach leverages the concurrent development of surrogate models for both simulation and experimental domains at the rates determined by latencies and costs of experiments and computation, alongside the adjustment of control parameters within theoretical models to minimize epistemic uncertainty over the experimental object spaces. This methodology facilitates the creation of digital twins of material structures, encompassing both the surrogate model of behavior that includes the correlative part and the theoretical model itself. While demonstrated here within the context of functional responses in ferroelectric materials, our approach holds promise for broader applications, the exploration of optical properties in nanoclusters, microstructure-dependent properties in complex materials, and properties of molecular systems.

In contrast to this paradigm, it is often significantly easier to provide raw, action-free visual data of tasks being performed. Moreover, this data can even be mined from video datasets or the web. Ideally, this data can serve to guide robot learning for new tasks in novel environments, informing both"what"to do and"how"to do it. A powerful way to encode both the"what"and the"how"is to infer a well-shaped reward function for reinforcement learning. The challenge is determining how to ground visual demonstration inputs into a well-shaped and informative reward function. We propose a technique Rank2Reward for learning behaviors from videos of tasks being performed without access to any low-level states and actions. We do so by leveraging the videos to learn a reward function that measures incremental"progress"through a task by learning how to temporally rank the video frames in a demonstration. By inferring an appropriate ranking, the reward function is able to guide reinforcement learning by indicating when task progress is being made. This ranking function can be integrated into an adversarial imitation learning scheme resulting in an algorithm that can learn behaviors without exploiting the learned reward function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Rank2Reward at learning behaviors from raw video on a number of tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulations and on a real-world robotic arm. We also demonstrate how Rank2Reward can be easily extended to be applicable to web-scale video datasets.">

In this letter, we design a method that integrates RL skills into TAMP pipelines. Besides the policy, a RL skill is defined with data-driven logical components that enable the skill to be deployed by symbolic planning. A plan refinement sub-routine is designed to further tackle the inevitable effect uncertainties.

To address this, the paper introduces a learning-based approach supported by a Neural Network-based Generative Model designed to address the inherent stochastic nature of such robots in visual servoing tasks. By generating large quantities of synthetic data that represent the stochastic effects, another learning model used for control can be trained to mitigate them. The method's efficacy is demonstrated in visual servoing tasks by significantly improving the accuracy of the robot.

Learning automated pick-and-place operations can be efficiently done by introducing collaborative autonomous systems (e.g. manipulators) in the workplace and among human operators. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning strategy to learn the place task of multi-categorical items from a shared workspace between dual-manipulators and to multi-goal destinations, assuming the pick has been already completed. The learning strategy leverages first a stochastic actor-critic framework to train an agent's policy network, and second, a dynamic 3D Gym environment where both static and dynamic obstacles (e.g. human factors and robot mate) constitute the state space of a Markov decision process. Learning is conducted in a Gazebo simulator and experiments show an increase in cumulative reward function for the agent further away from human factors. Future investigations will be conducted to enhance the task performance for both agents simultaneously.">

However, it still faces significant challenges, e.g., extrapolating to uncharted chemical spaces, interpreting long-range electrostatics, and mapping complex macroscopic properties. To address these issues, we advocate for a synergistic integration of physical principles and machine learning techniques within the framework of a physically informed neural network (PINN). This innovative approach involves the incorporation of physical constraints directly into the parameters of the neural network, coupled with the implementation of a global optimization strategy. We choose the AMOEBA+ force field as the physics-based model for embedding, and then train and test it using the diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) dataset as a case study. The results reveal a significant breakthrough in constructing a precise and noise-robust machine learning force field. Utilizing two training sets with hundreds of samples, our model exhibits remarkable generalization and DFT accuracy in describing molecular interactions and enables a precise prediction of the macroscopic properties such as diffusion coefficient with minimal cost. This work provides a crucial insight into establishing a fundamental framework of PINN.">

Hitherto, it has been separately addressed by employing operator learning surrogates for field prediction while using simulation-based inference (and its variants) for statistical parameter determination. Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.">

Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model, inspired by electrostatic fields in physics that, instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.">

Existing work either generates diffusion models one-time prior to training or requires additional interaction data to update it. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for offline reinforcement learning with closed-loop policy evaluation and world-model adaptation. It iteratively leverages a guided diffusion world model to directly evaluate the offline target policy with actions drawn from it, and then performs an importance-sampled world model update to adaptively align the world model with the updated policy. We analyzed the performance of the proposed method and provided an upper bound on the return gap between our method and the real environment under an optimal policy. The result sheds light on various factors affecting learning performance. Evaluations in the D4RL environment show significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, especially when only random or medium-expertise demonstrations are available -- thus requiring improved alignment between the world model and offline policy evaluation.">

Our contributions are of computational interest, where we demonstrate the ability to efficiently compute geodesics and amortize spline-based paths, which has not been done before, even in low dimensional problems.

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing relational data in applications. However, GNNs suffer from the problem of oversmoothing, the property that the features of all nodes exponentially converge to the same vector over layers, prohibiting the design of deep GNNs. In this work we study oversmoothing in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by using their Gaussian process (GP) equivalence in the limit of infinitely many hidden features. By generalizing methods from conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), we can describe the distribution of features at the output layer of deep GCNs in terms of a GP: as expected, we find that typical parameter choices from the literature lead to oversmoothing. The theory, however, allows us to identify a new, nonoversmoothing phase: if the initial weights of the network have sufficiently large variance, GCNs do not oversmooth, and node features remain informative even at large depth. We demonstrate the validity of this prediction in finite-size GCNs by training a linear classifier on their output. Moreover, using the linearization of the GCN GP, we generalize the concept of propagation depth of information from DNNs to GCNs. This propagation depth diverges at the transition between the oversmoothing and non-oversmoothing phase. We test the predictions of our approach and find good agreement with finite-size GCNs. Initializing GCNs near the transition to the non-oversmoothing phase, we obtain networks which are both deep and expressive.">

        <tr id="Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective method of finding reasoning pathways in incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). To overcome the challenges of a large action space, a self-supervised pre-training method is proposed to warm up the policy network before the RL training stage. To alleviate the distributional mismatch issue in general self-supervised RL (SSRL), in our supervised learning (SL) stage, the agent selects actions based on the policy network and learns from generated labels; this self-generation of labels is the intuition behind the name self-supervised. With this training framework, the information density of our SL objective is increased and the agent is prevented from getting stuck with the early rewarded paths. Our self-supervised RL (SSRL) method improves the performance of RL by pairing it with the wide coverage achieved by SL during pretraining, since the breadth of the SL objective makes it infeasible to train an agent with that alone. We show that our SSRL model meets or exceeds current state-of-the-art results on all Hits@k and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) metrics on four large benchmark KG datasets. This SSRL method can be used as a plug-in for any RL architecture for a KGR task. We adopt two RL architectures, i.e., MINERVA and MultiHopKG as our baseline RL models and experimentally show that our SSRL model consistently outperforms both baselines on all of these four KG reasoning tasks.

        <tr id="In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have had a dramatic impact on various sub-fields of AI, most notably on natural language understanding tasks. However, there is widespread agreement that the logical reasoning capabilities of contemporary LLMs are, at best, fragmentary (i.e., may work well on some problem instances but fail dramatically on others). While traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches (e.g., those that use human feedback) do address this problem to some degree, they suffer from many issues, including unsound black-box reward models, difficulties in collecting preference data, and sparse scalar reward values. To address these challenges, we propose a new training/fine-tuning paradigm we refer to as Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), which is aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In the RLSF setting, the LLM that is being trained/fine-tuned is considered as the RL agent, while the environment is allowed access to reasoning or domain knowledge tools (e.g., solvers, algebra systems). Crucially, in RLSF, these reasoning tools can provide feedback to the LLMs via poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs), that characterize errors in the LLM-generated object with respect to some correctness specification. The ability of RLSF-based training/fine-tuning to leverage certificate-generating symbolic tools enables sound fine-grained (token-level) reward signals to LLMs, and thus addresses the limitations of traditional reward models mentioned above. Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs outperforms traditional approaches on two different applications, namely, program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language (C++) and solving the Game of 24.">

To achieve our goal, we design several domain-aware motion field adapters (\ie, MOFA-Adapters) to control the generated motions in the video generation pipeline. For MOFA-Adapters, we consider the temporal motion consistency of the video and generate the dense motion flow from the given sparse control conditions first, and then, the multi-scale features of the given image are wrapped as a guided feature for stable video diffusion generation. We naively train two motion adapters for the manual trajectories and the human landmarks individually since they both contain sparse information about the control.

This makes it difficult to judge a planner's capabilities to generalize to rarely-seen situations. Therefore, we propose a novel closed-loop benchmark interPlan containing several edge cases and challenging driving scenarios.

Current methods struggle with accurately interpreting geometry diagrams, which hinders effective problem-solving. To tackle this issue, we present the Geometry problem sOlver with natural Language Description (GOLD) model. GOLD enhances the extraction of geometric relations by separately processing symbols and geometric primitives within the diagram. Subsequently, it converts the extracted relations into natural language descriptions, efficiently utilizing large language models to solve geometry math problems. Experiments show that the GOLD model outperforms the Geoformer model, the previous best method on the UniGeo dataset, by achieving accuracy improvements of 12.7% and 42.1% in calculation and proving subsets. Additionally, it surpasses the former best model on the PGPS9K and Geometry3K datasets, PGPSNet, by obtaining accuracy enhancements of 1.8% and 3.2%, respectively.">

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation.

Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand.

To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.">

A less explored avenue is their application to discriminative tasks involving regression or classification problems. The cornerstone of modern cosmology is the ability to generate predictions for observed astrophysical fields from theory and constrain physical models from observations using these predictions. This work uses a single diffusion generative model to address these interlinked objectives -- as a surrogate model or emulator for cold dark matter density fields conditional on input cosmological parameters, and as a parameter inference model that solves the inverse problem of constraining the cosmological parameters of an input field. The model is able to emulate fields with summary statistics consistent with those of the simulated target distribution. We then leverage the approximate likelihood of the diffusion generative model to derive tight constraints on cosmology by using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior on cosmological parameters for a given test image. Finally, we demonstrate that this parameter inference approach is more robust to the addition of noise than baseline parameter inference networks.">

        <tr id="Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically parameterize the policy as a deep network that outputs either a deterministic action or a stochastic one modeled as a Gaussian distribution, hence restricting learning to a single behavioral mode. Meanwhile, diffusion models emerged as a powerful framework for multimodal learning. However, the use of diffusion policies in online RL is hindered by the intractability of policy likelihood approximation, as well as the greedy objective of RL methods that can easily skew the policy to a single mode. This paper presents Deep Diffusion Policy Gradient (DDiffPG), a novel actor-critic algorithm that learns from scratch multimodal policies parameterized as diffusion models while discovering and maintaining versatile behaviors. DDiffPG explores and discovers multiple modes through off-the-shelf unsupervised clustering combined with novelty-based intrinsic motivation. DDiffPG forms a multimodal training batch and utilizes mode-specific Q-learning to mitigate the inherent greediness of the RL objective, ensuring the improvement of the diffusion policy across all modes. Our approach further allows the policy to be conditioned on mode-specific embeddings to explicitly control the learned modes. Empirical studies validate DDiffPG's capability to master multimodal behaviors in complex, high-dimensional continuous control tasks with sparse rewards, also showcasing proof-of-concept dynamic online replanning when navigating mazes with unseen obstacles.">

We seek to determine which model best captures temporal dependent behavior. We find that, depending on the robot's design, choosing different kinematic inputs can alter whether hysteresis is exhibited by the system.

However, it is equally important to find deep local minima of losses (i.e., produce outputs with much smaller loss values compared to other minima), even when architectures cannot express global minima. In this work we introduce the architectural property of attracting optimization trajectories to local minima as a means of achieving smaller loss values. We take first steps in satisfying this property for losses defined over attributed undirected unweighted graphs with an architecture called universal local attractor (ULA). This refines each dimension of end-to-end-trained node feature embeddings based on graph structure to track the optimization trajectories of losses satisfying some mild conditions. The refined dimensions are then linearly pooled to create predictions. We experiment on 11 tasks, from node classification to clique detection, on which ULA is comparable with or outperforms popular alternatives of similar or greater theoretical expressive power.">

Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.">

        <tr id="Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.">

Maintaining accuracy over multiple reasoning steps remains a primary challenge, as current models often rely on shortcuts rather than genuine multi-step reasoning, leading to performance degradation as task complexity increases. Existing research highlights these shortcomings but lacks comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis for SSMs. Our contributions address this gap by providing a theoretical framework based on complexity theory to explain SSMs' limitations. Moreover, we present extensive empirical evidence demonstrating how these limitations impair function composition and algorithmic task performance. Our experiments reveal significant performance drops as task complexity increases, even with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.">

        <tr id="Pretrained Optimization Models (POMs) leverage knowledge gained from optimizing various tasks, providing efficient solutions for new optimization challenges through direct usage or fine-tuning. Despite the inefficiencies and limited generalization abilities observed in current POMs, our proposed model, the general pre-trained optimization model (GPOM), addresses these shortcomings. GPOM constructs a population-based pretrained Black-Box Optimization (BBO) model tailored for continuous optimization. Evaluation on the BBOB benchmark and two robot control tasks demonstrates that GPOM outperforms other pretrained BBO models significantly, especially for high-dimensional tasks. Its direct optimization performance exceeds that of state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms and POMs. Furthermore, GPOM exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse task distributions, dimensions, population sizes, and optimization horizons.">

        <tr id="The identification of substructures within halos in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations is a fundamental step to identify the simulated counterparts of real objects, namely galaxies. For this reason, substructure finders play a crucial role in extracting relevant information from the simulation outputs. They are based on physically-motivated definitions of substructures, performing multiple steps of particle-by-particle operations, thus computationally expensive. The purpose of this work is to develop a fast algorithm to identify substructures in simulations. The final aim, besides a faster production of subhalo catalogues, is to provide an algorithm fast enough to be applied with a fine time-cadence during the evolution of the simulations. We chose to apply the architecture of a well known Fully Convolutional Network, U-Net, to the identification of substructures within the mass density field of the simulation. We have developed SubDLe (Substructure identification with Deep Learning), an algorithm which combines a 3D generalization of U-Net and a Friends-of-Friends algorithm, and trained it to reproduce the identification of substructures performed by the SubFind algorithm in a set of zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. For the feasibility study presented in this work, we have trained and tested SubDLe on galaxy clusters at $z=0$, using a NVIDIA P100 GPU. We focused our tests on the version of the algorithm working on the identification of purely stellar substructures, stellar SubDLe. Our stellar SubDLe is capable of identifying the majority of galaxies in the challenging high-density environment of galaxy clusters in short computing times. This result has interesting implications in view of the possibility of integrating fast subhalo finders within simulation codes, that can take advantage of accelerators available on state-of-art computing nodes.">

However, existing trajectory generation methods are still in their infancy due to the inherent diversity and unpredictability of human activities, grappling with issues such as fidelity, flexibility, and generalizability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose ControlTraj, a Controllable Trajectory generation framework with the topology-constrained diffusion model. Distinct from prior approaches, ControlTraj utilizes a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity trajectories while integrating the structural constraints of road network topology to guide the geographical outcomes. Specifically, we develop a novel road segment autoencoder to extract fine-grained road segment embedding. The encoded features, along with trip attributes, are subsequently merged into the proposed geographic denoising UNet architecture, named GeoUNet, to synthesize geographic trajectories from white noise. Through experimentation across three real-world data settings, ControlTraj demonstrates its ability to produce human-directed, high-fidelity trajectory generation with adaptability to unexplored geographical contexts.">

We explore using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling dynamic processes governed by differential-algebraic equation systems when process data is scarce and complete mechanistic knowledge is missing. In particular, we focus on estimating states for which neither direct observational data nor constitutive equations are available. For demonstration purposes, we study a continuously stirred tank reactor and a liquid-liquid separator. We find that PINNs can infer unmeasured states with reasonable accuracy, and they generalize better in low-data scenarios than purely data-driven models. We thus show that PINNs, similar to hybrid mechanistic/data-driven models, are capable of modeling processes when relatively few experimental data and only partially known mechanistic descriptions are available, and conclude that they constitute a promising avenue that warrants further investigation.">

On the forward pass through a BNN, predictions (and their uncertainties) are made either by Monte Carlo sampling network weights from the learned posterior or by analytically propagating statistical moments through the network. Though flexible, Monte Carlo sampling is computationally expensive and can be infeasible or impractical under resource constraints or for large networks. While moment propagation can ameliorate the computational costs of BNN inference, it can be difficult or impossible for networks with arbitrary nonlinearities, thereby restricting the possible set of network layers permitted with such a scheme. In this work, we demonstrate a simple yet effective approach for propagating statistical moments through arbitrary nonlinearities with only 3 deterministic samples, enabling few-sample variational inference of BNNs without restricting the set of network layers used. Furthermore, we leverage this approach to demonstrate a novel nonlinear activation function that we use to inject physics-informed prior information into output nodes of a BNN.">

        <tr id="We consider the problem of learning the dynamics in the topology of time-evolving point clouds, the prevalent spatiotemporal model for systems exhibiting collective behavior, such as swarms of insects and birds or particles in physics. In such systems, patterns emerge from (local) interactions among self-propelled entities. While several well-understood governing equations for motion and interaction exist, they are difficult to fit to data due to the often large number of entities and missing correspondences between the observation times, which may also not be equidistant. To evade such confounding factors, we investigate collective behavior from a \textit{topological perspective}, but instead of summarizing entire observation sequences (as in prior work), we propose learning a latent dynamical model from topological features \textit{per time point}. The latter is then used to formulate a downstream regression task to predict the parametrization of some a priori specified governing equation. We implement this idea based on a latent ODE learned from vectorized (static) persistence diagrams and show that this modeling choice is justified by a combination of recent stability results for persistent homology. Various (ablation) experiments not only demonstrate the relevance of each individual model component, but provide compelling empirical evidence that our proposed model -- \textit{neural persistence dynamics} -- substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art across a diverse set of parameter regression tasks.">

To this end, consider a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) model where the LLM Planner and the Actor perform high-level task planning and low-level execution, respectively. Under this model, the LLM Planner navigates a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) by iteratively generating language-based subgoals via prompting. Under proper assumptions on the pretraining data, we prove that the pretrained LLM Planner effectively performs Bayesian aggregated imitation learning (BAIL) through in-context learning. Additionally, we highlight the necessity for exploration beyond the subgoals derived from BAIL by proving that naively executing the subgoals returned by LLM leads to a linear regret. As a remedy, we introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy to BAIL, which is proven to incur sublinear regret when the pretraining error is small. Finally, we extend our theoretical framework to include scenarios where the LLM Planner serves as a world model for inferring the transition model of the environment and to multi-agent settings, enabling coordination among multiple Actors.">

However, most existing approaches are trained in well-tuned simulators and subsequently deployed on real robots without online fine-tuning. In this setting, the simulation's realism seriously impacts the deployment's success rate. Instead, learning with real-world interaction data offers a promising alternative: not only eliminates the need for a fine-tuned simulator but also applies to a broader range of tasks where accurate modeling is unfeasible. One major problem for on-robot reinforcement learning is ensuring safety, as uncontrolled exploration can cause catastrophic damage to the robot or the environment. Indeed, safety specifications, often represented as constraints, can be complex and non-linear, making safety challenging to guarantee in learning systems. In this paper, we show how we can impose complex safety constraints on learning-based robotics systems in a principled manner, both from theoretical and practical points of view. Our approach is based on the concept of the Constraint Manifold, representing the set of safe robot configurations. Exploiting differential geometry techniques, i.e., the tangent space, we can construct a safe action space, allowing learning agents to sample arbitrary actions while ensuring safety. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness in a real-world Robot Air Hockey task, showing that our method can handle high-dimensional tasks with complex constraints.

Out-of-the-box, the model serves as a machine learning force field, and shows remarkable capabilities not only in predicting ground-state material structures and energetics, but also in simulating their behavior under realistic temperatures and pressures, signifying an up to ten-fold enhancement in precision compared to the prior best-in-class. This enables MatterSim to compute materials' lattice dynamics, mechanical and thermodynamic properties, and beyond, to an accuracy comparable with first-principles methods. Specifically, MatterSim predicts Gibbs free energies for a wide range of inorganic solids with near-first-principles accuracy and achieves a 15 meV/atom resolution for temperatures up to 1000K compared with experiments. This opens an opportunity to predict experimental phase diagrams of materials at minimal computational cost. Moreover, MatterSim also serves as a platform for continuous learning and customization by integrating domain-specific data.

        <tr id="Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been crucial to the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), however, it is often a complex and brittle process. In the classical RLHF framework, a reward model is first trained to represent human preferences, which is in turn used by an online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to optimize the LLM. A prominent issue with such methods is \emph{reward over-optimization} or \emph{reward hacking}, where performance as measured by the learned proxy reward model increases, but true quality plateaus or even deteriorates. Direct Alignment Algorithms (DDAs) like Direct Preference Optimization have emerged as alternatives to the classical RLHF pipeline by circumventing the reward modeling phase. However, although DAAs do not use a separate proxy reward model, they still commonly deteriorate from over-optimization. While the so-called reward hacking phenomenon is not well-defined for DAAs, we still uncover similar trends: at higher KL budgets, DAA algorithms exhibit similar degradation patterns to their classic RLHF counterparts. In particular, we find that DAA methods deteriorate not only across a wide range of KL budgets but also often before even a single epoch of the dataset is completed. Through extensive empirical experimentation, this work formulates and formalizes the reward over-optimization or hacking problem for DAAs and explores its consequences across objectives, training regimes, and model scales.">

Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods. We experimentally validate our approach in data-free Combinatorial Optimization and demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark problems.">

Thus, incorporating elastic actuators in the robot's mechanical design has become popular, since it offers intrinsic compliance and additionally provide a coarse estimate for the interaction force by measuring the deformation of the elastic components. While observer-based methods have been shown to improve these estimates, they rely on accurate models of the system, which are challenging to obtain in complex operating environments. In this work, we overcome this issue by learning the unknown dynamics components using Gaussian process (GP) regression. By employing the learned model in a Bayesian filtering framework, we improve the estimation accuracy and additionally obtain an observer that explicitly considers local model uncertainty in the confidence measure of the state estimate. Furthermore, we derive guaranteed estimation error bounds, thus, facilitating the use in safety-critical applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach experimentally in a human-exoskeleton interaction scenario.">

        <tr id="Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. A prevalent approach involves training a conditional generative model on existing designs and their associated scores, followed by the generation of new designs conditioned on higher target scores. However, these newly generated designs often underperform due to the lack of high-scoring training data. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization (DEMO), which consists of two phases. In the first phase, termed pseudo-target distribution generation, we apply gradient ascent on the offline dataset using a trained surrogate model, producing a synthetic dataset where the predicted scores serve as new labels. A conditional diffusion model is subsequently trained on this synthetic dataset to capture a pseudo-target distribution, which enhances the accuracy of the conditional diffusion model in generating higher-scoring designs. Nevertheless, the pseudo-target distribution is susceptible to noise stemming from inaccuracies in the surrogate model, consequently predisposing the conditional diffusion model to generate suboptimal designs. We hence propose the second phase, existing design editing, to directly incorporate the high-scoring features from the offline dataset into design generation. In this phase, top designs from the offline dataset are edited by introducing noise, which are subsequently refined using the conditional diffusion model to produce high-scoring designs. Overall, high-scoring designs begin with inheriting high-scoring features from the second phase and are further refined with a more accurate conditional diffusion model in the first phase. Empirical evaluations on 7 offline MBO tasks show that DEMO outperforms various baseline methods.">

Unlike conventional computational fluid dynamics methods, PINNs offer advantages by eliminating the need for discretized meshes and enabling the direct solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we propose the weighted Extended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WXPINNs) and weighted Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WCPINNs), tailored for detailed hemodynamic simulations based on generalized space-time domain decomposition techniques. The inclusion of multiple neural networks enhances the representation capacity of the weighted PINN methods. Furthermore, the weighted PINNs can be efficiently trained in parallel computing frameworks by employing separate neural networks for each sub-domain. We show that PINNs simulation results circumvent backflow instabilities, underscoring a notable advantage of employing PINNs over traditional numerical methods to solve such complex blood flow models. They naturally address such challenges within their formulations. The presented numerical results demonstrate that the proposed weighted PINNs outperform traditional PINNs settings, where sub-PINNs are applied to each subdomain separately.

 To improve predictive machine learning-based models limited by sparse data, supplemental physics-related features are introduced into a deep neural network (DNN). While some approaches inject physics through differential equations or numerical simulation, improvements are possible using simplified relationships from engineering references. To evaluate this hypothesis, thin rectangular plates were simulated to generate training datasets. With plate dimensions and material properties as input features and fundamental natural frequency as the output, predictive performance of a data-driven DNN-based model is compared with models using supplemental inputs, such as modulus of rigidity. To evaluate model accuracy improvements, these additional features are injected into various DNN layers, and the network is trained with four different dataset sizes. When evaluated against independent data of similar features to the training sets, supplementation provides no statistically-significant prediction error reduction. However, notable accuracy gains occur when independent test data is of material and dimensions different from the original training set. Furthermore, when physics-enhanced data is injected into multiple DNN layers, reductions in mean error from 33.2% to 19.6%, 34.9% to 19.9%, 35.8% to 22.4%, and 43.0% to 28.4% are achieved for dataset sizes of 261, 117, 60, and 30, respectively, demonstrating potential for generalizability using a data supplementation approach. Additionally, when compared with other methods—such as linear regression and support vector machine (SVM) approaches—the physics-enhanced DNN demonstrates an order of magnitude reduction in percentage error for dataset sizes of 261, 117, and 60 and a 30% reduction for a size of 30 when compared with a cubic SVM model independently tested with data divergent from the training and validation set.">

Traditional model-based controllers often struggle to achieve desired control performance in such systems. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a trending machine learning technique widely adopted in robot control, offers a promising alternative. However, integrating DRL into these robotic systems faces significant challenges, including the requirement for large amounts of training data and the inevitable sim-to-real gap when deployed to real-world robots. This paper proposes an efficient reinforcement learning control framework with sim-to-real transfer to address these challenges. Bootstrap and augmentation enhancements are designed to improve the data efficiency of baseline DRL algorithms, while a sim-to-real transfer technique, namely randomization of muscle dynamics, is adopted to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world deployment. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted utilizing two string-type artificial muscle-driven robotic systems including a two degree-of-freedom robotic eye and a parallel robotic wrist, the results of which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning control strategy.">

Our approach leverages the stochastic interpolant framework, simulation dynamics, and adversarial training to optimize the inference pathway. Notably, incorporating tensor-valued time during training improves some models' inference performance, even without path optimization. When the adaptive, multidimensional path derived from our optimization process is employed, further performance gains are achieved despite the fixed solver configurations.

Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting. Furthermore, our method achieves rapid adaptation to new CSTRs, BRs, and PFRs using only a few data samples from the designated tasks.

        <tr id="Time-dependent flow fields are typically generated by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, which is an extremely time-consuming process. However, the latent relationship between the flow fields is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations and can be described by an operator. We therefore train a deep operator network, or simply DeepONet, to learn the temporal evolution between flow snapshots. Once properly trained, given a few consecutive snapshots as input, the network has a great potential to generate the next snapshot accurately and quickly. Using the output as a new input, the network iterates the process, generating a series of successive snapshots with little wall time. Specifically, we consider 2D flow around a circular cylinder at Reynolds number 1000, and prepare a set of high-fidelity data using a high-order spectral/hp element method as ground truth. Although the flow fields are periodic, there are many small-scale features in the wake flow that are difficult to generate accurately. Furthermore, any discrepancy between the prediction and the ground truth for the first snapshots can easily accumulate during the iterative process, which eventually amplifies the overall deviations. Therefore, we propose two alternative techniques to improve the training of DeepONet. The first one enhances the feature extraction of the network by harnessing the"multi-head non-local block". The second one refines the network parameters by leveraging the local smooth optimization technique. Both techniques prove to be highly effective in reducing the cumulative errors and our results outperform those of the dynamic mode decomposition method.">

This method transforms AlphaFold2 into a diffusion model by implementing a conformation-based diffusion process and adapting the architecture to process diffused inputs effectively. To counteract the inherent conformational bias in the Protein Data Bank, we developed a novel hierarchical reweighting protocol based on structural clustering. Our evaluations demonstrate that Diffold outperforms existing methods in terms of successful sampling and structural validity. The comparisons with long time molecular dynamics show that Diffold can overcome the energy barrier existing in molecular dynamics simulations and perform more efficient sampling. Furthermore, We showcase Diffold’s utility in drug discovery through its application in neural protein-ligand docking. In a blind test, it accurately predicted a novel protein-ligand complex, underscoring its potential to impact real-world biological research.

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing outputs and gradients of deep models to satisfy target equations. Due to the limitation of numerical computation, PINNs are conventionally optimized on finite selected points. However, since PDEs are usually defined on continuous domains, solely optimizing models on scattered points may be insufficient to obtain an accurate solution for the whole domain. To mitigate this inherent deficiency of the default scatter-point optimization, this paper proposes and theoretically studies a new training paradigm as region optimization. Concretely, we propose to extend the optimization process of PINNs from isolated points to their continuous neighborhood regions, which can theoretically decrease the generalization error, especially for hidden high-order constraints of PDEs. A practical training algorithm, Region Optimized PINN (RoPINN), is seamlessly derived from this new paradigm, which is implemented by a straightforward but effective Monte Carlo sampling method. By calibrating the sampling process into trust regions, RoPINN finely balances sampling efficiency and generalization error. Experimentally, RoPINN consistently boosts the performance of diverse PINNs on a wide range of PDEs without extra backpropagation or gradient calculation.">

Much of this history has focused on combining models for classification and regression, but recently there is interest in more complex settings such as ensembling policies in reinforcement learning. Strong connections have also emerged between ensembling and multicalibration techniques. In this work, we further investigate these themes by considering a setting in which we wish to ensemble models for multidimensional output predictions that are in turn used for downstream optimization. More precisely, we imagine we are given a number of models mapping a state space to multidimensional real-valued predictions. These predictions form the coefficients of a linear objective that we would like to optimize under specified constraints. The fundamental question we address is how to improve and combine such models in a way that outperforms the best of them in the downstream optimization problem. We apply multicalibration techniques that lead to two provably efficient and convergent algorithms. The first of these (the white box approach) requires being given models that map states to output predictions, while the second (the \emph{black box} approach) requires only policies (mappings from states to solutions to the optimization problem). For both, we provide convergence and utility guarantees. We conclude by investigating the performance and behavior of the two algorithms in a controlled experimental setting.">

Recent studies such as the neural ordinary differential equation proposed a time-dependent neural network, which provides a neural network varying with respect to time. However, we claim that the architectural choice to build a time-dependent neural network significantly affects its time-awareness but still lacks sufficient validation in its current states. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the architecture of modern time-dependent neural networks. Here, we report a vulnerability of vanishing timestep embedding, which disables the time-awareness of a time-dependent neural network. Furthermore, we find that this vulnerability can also be observed in diffusion models because they employ a similar architecture that incorporates timestep embedding to discriminate between different timesteps during a diffusion process. Our analysis provides a detailed description of this phenomenon as well as several solutions to address the root cause. Through experiments on neural ordinary differential equations and diffusion models, we observed that ensuring alive time-awareness via proposed solutions boosted their performance, which implies that their current implementations lack sufficient time-dependency.">

Sampling from DMs can be seen as solving a differential equation through a discretized set of noise levels known as the sampling schedule. While past works primarily focused on deriving efficient solvers, little attention has been given to finding optimal sampling schedules, and the entire literature relies on hand-crafted heuristics. In this work, for the first time, we propose a general and principled approach to optimizing the sampling schedules of DMs for high-quality outputs, called $\textit{Align Your Steps}$. We leverage methods from stochastic calculus and find optimal schedules specific to different solvers, trained DMs and datasets. We evaluate our novel approach on several image, video as well as 2D toy data synthesis benchmarks, using a variety of different samplers, and observe that our optimized schedules outperform previous hand-crafted schedules in almost all experiments.

This speaks to the generalizability of the models, having never been explicitly trained on reactions, the machine learned potential approximates the potential energy surface well enough to be performant for this auxiliary task. We introduce the Open Catalyst 2020 Nudged Elastic Band (OC20NEB) dataset, which is made of 932 DFT nudged elastic band calculations, to benchmark machine learned model performance on transition state energies. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we replicated a well-known, large reaction network with 61 intermediates and 174 dissociation reactions at DFT resolution (40 meV). In this case of dense NEB enumeration, we realize even more computational cost savings and used just 12 GPU days of compute, where DFT would have taken 52 GPU years, a 1500x speedup. Similar searches for complete reaction networks could become routine using the approach presented here. Finally, we replicated an ammonia synthesis activity volcano and systematically found lower energy configurations of the transition states and intermediates on six stepped unary surfaces. This scalable approach offers a more complete treatment of configurational space to improve and accelerate catalyst discovery.">

        <tr id="The generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) optimization method incorporates curvature estimates into its solution steps, and provides a good approximation to the Newton method for large-scale optimization problems. GGN has been found particularly interesting for practical training of deep neural networks, not only for its impressive convergence speed, but also for its close relation with neural tangent kernel regression, which is central to recent studies that aim to understand the optimization and generalization properties of neural networks. This work studies a GGN method for optimizing a two-layer neural network with explicit regularization. In particular, we consider a class of generalized self-concordant (GSC) functions that provide smooth approximations to commonly-used penalty terms in the objective function of the optimization problem. This approach provides an adaptive learning rate selection technique that requires little to no tuning for optimal performance. We study the convergence of the two-layer neural network, considered to be overparameterized, in the optimization loop of the resulting GGN method for a given scaling of the network parameters. Our numerical experiments highlight specific aspects of GSC regularization that help to improve generalization of the optimized neural network. The code to reproduce the experimental results is available at https://github.com/adeyemiadeoye/ggn-score-nn.">

        <tr id="Understanding the mechanisms underlying crystal formation is crucial. For most systems, crystallization typically goes through a nucleation process that involves dynamics that happen at short time and length scales. Due to this, molecular dynamics serves as a powerful tool to study this phenomenon. Existing approaches to study the mechanism often focus analysis on static snapshots of the global configuration, potentially overlooking subtle local fluctuations and history of the atoms involved in the formation of solid nuclei. To address this limitation, we propose a methodology that categorizes nucleation pathways into reactive pathways based on the time evolution of constituent atoms. Our approach effectively captures the diverse structural pathways explored by crystallizing Lennard-Jones-like particles and solidifying Ni$_3$Al, providing a more nuanced understanding of nucleating pathways. Moreover, our methodology enables the prediction of the resulting polymorph from each reactive trajectory. This deep learning-assisted comprehensive analysis offers an alternative view of crystal nucleation mechanisms and pathways.">

        <tr id="Symbolic regression has excelled in uncovering equations from physics, chemistry, biology, and related disciplines. However, its effectiveness becomes less certain when applied to experimental data lacking inherent closed-form expressions. Empirically derived relationships, such as entire stress-strain curves, may defy concise closed-form representation, compelling us to explore more adaptive modeling approaches that balance flexibility with interpretability. In our pursuit, we turn to Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), a widely used class of models known for their versatility across various domains. Although GAMs can capture non-linear relationships between variables and targets, they cannot capture intricate feature interactions. In this work, we investigate both of these challenges and propose a novel class of models, Shape Arithmetic Expressions (SHAREs), that fuses GAM's flexible shape functions with the complex feature interactions found in mathematical expressions. SHAREs also provide a unifying framework for both of these approaches. We also design a set of rules for constructing SHAREs that guarantee transparency of the found expressions beyond the standard constraints based on the model's size.">

        <tr id="Over the past few years, research on deep graph learning has shifted from static graphs to temporal graphs in response to real-world complex systems that exhibit dynamic behaviors. In practice, temporal graphs are formalized as an ordered sequence of static graph snapshots observed at discrete time points. Sequence models such as RNNs or Transformers have long been the predominant backbone networks for modeling such temporal graphs. Yet, despite the promising results, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models (SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying continuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention and achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In this work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to temporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online approximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term. The emergent continuous-time system introduces novel algorithmic challenges, thereby necessitating our development of GraphSSM, a graph state space model for modeling the dynamics of temporal graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphSSM framework across various temporal graph benchmarks.">

        <tr id="A new knowledge-based and machine learning hybrid modeling approach, called conditional Gaussian neural stochastic differential equation (CGNSDE), is developed to facilitate modeling complex dynamical systems and implementing analytic formulae of the associated data assimilation (DA). In contrast to the standard neural network predictive models, the CGNSDE is designed to effectively tackle both forward prediction tasks and inverse state estimation problems. The CGNSDE starts by exploiting a systematic causal inference via information theory to build a simple knowledge-based nonlinear model that nevertheless captures as much explainable physics as possible. Then, neural networks are supplemented to the knowledge-based model in a specific way, which not only characterizes the remaining features that are challenging to model with simple forms but also advances the use of analytic formulae to efficiently compute the nonlinear DA solution. These analytic formulae are used as an additional computationally affordable loss to train the neural networks that directly improve the DA accuracy. This DA loss function promotes the CGNSDE to capture the interactions between state variables and thus advances its modeling skills. With the DA loss, the CGNSDE is more capable of estimating extreme events and quantifying the associated uncertainty. Furthermore, crucial physical properties in many complex systems, such as the translate-invariant local dependence of state variables, can significantly simplify the neural network structures and facilitate the CGNSDE to be applied to high-dimensional systems. Numerical experiments based on chaotic systems with intermittency and strong non-Gaussian features indicate that the CGNSDE outperforms knowledge-based regression models, and the DA loss further enhances the modeling skills of the CGNSDE.">

        <tr id="Numerous studies on adversarial attacks targeting self-driving policies fail to incorporate realistic-looking adversarial objects, limiting real-world applicability. Building upon prior research that facilitated the transition of adversarial objects from simulations to practical applications, this paper discusses a modified gradient-based texture optimization method to discover realistic-looking adversarial objects. While retaining the core architecture and techniques of the prior research, the proposed addition involves an entity termed the 'Judge'. This agent assesses the texture of a rendered object, assigning a probability score reflecting its realism. This score is integrated into the loss function to encourage the NeRF object renderer to concurrently learn realistic and adversarial textures. The paper analyzes four strategies for developing a robust 'Judge': 1) Leveraging cutting-edge vision-language models. 2) Fine-tuning open-sourced vision-language models. 3) Pretraining neurosymbolic systems. 4) Utilizing traditional image processing techniques. Our findings indicate that strategies 1) and 4) yield less reliable outcomes, pointing towards strategies 2) or 3) as more promising directions for future research.">
